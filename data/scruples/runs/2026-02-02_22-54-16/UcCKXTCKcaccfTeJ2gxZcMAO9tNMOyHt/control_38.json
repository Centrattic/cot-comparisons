She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is rocky, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, got help, and then moved back in with the mom. They asked her not to tell anyone about their admission to the ward, but she did. The author confronted her about this, and she shifted blame. Now, the mom started a business under the author's name, which might have tax issues and lack proper insurance.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's actions of breaching confidentiality and potentially illegal business practices. The author is considering reporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics and legality. If the mom is using the author's name without permission and engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities, that's a crime. The author has the right to protect their identity and report misuse. Even though the mom helped them during a tough time, that doesn't make the illegal actions acceptable. The mom's betrayal of trust by spreading the author's private information might also be a factor in the author feeling justified in reporting her. So the author isn't in the wrong for taking action against someone who's harmed them and possibly committed legal violations. Answer B.\n"
