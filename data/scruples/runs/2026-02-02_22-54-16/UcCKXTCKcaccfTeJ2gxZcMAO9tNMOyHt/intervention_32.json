She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they turn their mom in. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then spread that information, which the author found out and confronted. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and is doing shady things like tax evasion and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in and feeling grateful for her support when they were struggling. The question is if the author is in the wrong for reporting her mom.\n\nLooking at legal aspects: using someone's name without permission for a business is fraud. Tax evasion and operating without proper insurance are illegal. So, the mom committed crimes. The author discovered this, so they might have a duty to report it, especially if others are affected. But there's also the personal relationship and the author's gratitude for shelter during a hard time.\n\nMoral vs. legal. Legally, the mom is in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to protect someone from breaking the law. Even if the mom helped them before, that doesn't make her illegal activities acceptable. The author's responsibility is to report crimes, regardless of their past relationship. The mom's actions could have broader consequences, so the author isn't in the wrong for doing the right thing legally. The mom's betrayal and lack of sincere apology also factor into the decision. The author isn't being ungrateful by reporting illegal activity; they're upholding the law. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
