She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and moved back in with her, trusting her not to tell anyone about their hospitalization. But the mom told everyone, and now there's a new issue where the mom started a business in the author's name with some shady practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom is operating a business in the author's name without their consent, that's identity theft or fraud, which is illegal. The author could be facing legal trouble if the business is involved in tax evasion or other illegal activities, even if they weren't involved. So turning in the mom might be necessary to protect the author's legal standing.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is grateful for the mom's help during their mental health crisis, but the mom betrayed their trust and is now potentially using their name for illegal activities. The author is caught between gratitude and the need to report the mom's actions. The mom's lack of remorse and manipulative behavior (as indicated by her response to the betrayal) might make it even more justified for the author to report her to stop further harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author is protecting themselves by reporting the mom. If the business is illegal, the author could be implicated if they don't act. By turning in the mom, they might be preventing future issues for themselves.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is being ungrateful, especially since the mom provided a place to stay. However, given the mom's pattern of behavior (lying, betrayal, lack of accountability), it's possible that the author is prioritizing their own well-being and legal safety over past favors.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They are addressing a legal issue that could affect them and protecting themselves from potential consequences of the mom's actions. The answer should be B.\n"
