She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is considering turning in their mom because she opened a business in their name and did some shady stuff with it. Their mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author told their mom about their mental health issues, and the mom told everyone, which the author was really upset about. Now the mom started this business without permission, and the author is debating whether to report her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission for a business, that's probably illegal. Using someone's name for business registration without their consent is identity theft or fraud. Plus, the mom is doing tax evasion, not reporting purchases, and not having proper insurance. Those are legal issues. So from a legal standpoint, the author might have a right to report her because those are criminal activities.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is in a complicated relationship with their mom. They've lived with her rent-free, which the author is grateful for. But the mom has betrayed their trust by telling others about their mental health and now is using their identity. The author is torn between gratitude and the need to expose the mom's wrongdoing. The mom's actions are harmful, both legally and in terms of trust.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in. If the author reports her, they might be seen as betraying their own, but if they don't, the mom continues to commit illegal acts. The author might be protecting the mom from legal consequences, which could hurt others if the business isn't legitimate. On the other hand, reporting could lead to legal problems for the mom, which might affect the author, especially if the mom retaliates or if there's ongoing family issues.\n\nBut legally, the author isn't responsible for the mom's actions. The mom is the one who committed the fraud. The author's responsibility is to report illegal activities to prevent harm to others and to themselves. Even though they have a complicated history, the law doesn't consider familial relationships when it comes to criminal acts. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. They might be in a tough spot emotionally, but ethically, they're doing the right thing by not letting someone else's illegal actions go unchecked.\n"
