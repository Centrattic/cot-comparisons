She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on and off, with long periods of silence. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They later moved in with her, living rent-free. The mom then told everyone about the author's mental health issues, which the author confronted, but the mom didn't genuinely apologize. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with potentially illegal activities like tax evasion, using the business account as personal, and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe question is whether the author would be in the wrong (A) or not (B) if they turned in their mom. Let's break it down. The author is considering reporting their mom for possible illegal activities. Even though the mom has been untrustworthy and hurtful, the author has benefited from living with her rent-free. The mom's actions might be illegal, so reporting her could be a legal duty. However, there's a personal relationship aspect here. The author might feel conflicted because their mom has provided support during a tough time. \n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions (starting a business in the author's name, tax issues, etc.) could be illegal, so the author has a responsibility to report them. On the other hand, the author might feel obligated to protect their mom due to their past relationship and the support the mom provided. But the mom has a history of betrayal, like sharing the author's private information. The author's primary duty might be to the law and their own well-being. If the mom is engaging in illegal activities, not reporting could be complicit. However, there's also the emotional aspect of whether the author is being ungrateful for the support they received, even if the mom's actions were harmful.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) The mom's actions are potentially illegal. 2) The mom has a history of betrayal and lack of accountability. 3) The author is considering reporting her despite the past support. Legally, if someone is committing crimes, others are not necessarily responsible unless they are complicit. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe the mom is breaking the law. However, if the author is a co-owner or authorized the business in some way without knowing, it could be different. The author says the mom started the business in their name without their consent, which is a problem. So the author might have been a victim of identity misuse. In that case, reporting could be the right thing to do. The past actions of the mom (telling secrets, not apologizing) might diminish the sense of obligation the author has towards her. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for exposing the mom's illegal activities. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
