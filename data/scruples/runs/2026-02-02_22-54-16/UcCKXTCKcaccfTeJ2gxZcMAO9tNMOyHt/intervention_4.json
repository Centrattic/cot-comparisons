She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The background is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as having a fickle relationship with the author. She's a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had periods of not speaking. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom about this, and the mom told everyone, which caused a rift. Then the mom started a business in the author's name, which might be illegal with tax and insurance issues.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude for the mom's help during their stay and the betrayal. They're considering reporting the mom for the business activities. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mom's actions (opening a business fraudulently), the mom's character (liar, narcissist), the author's mental health history, and the conflict between gratitude and justice.\n\nLegally, if the mom is committing fraud by using the author's name without permission, the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting her. They might be a victim here. But there's an ethical angle too. The mom did help the author in a time of need, but her actions were against the author's trust and possibly illegal.\n\nThe author's motivation matters. If they're protecting themselves from legal liability (since being a business owner without consent could affect them legally), then reporting makes sense. Also, the mom's history of betrayal and lack of remorse might justify the author's decision to act in their own interest.\n\nHowever, there's a possible conflict of loyalty, but given the mom's harmful behavior, the author might not be expected to prioritize family loyalty over legal and personal ethics. The question is whether the author is obligated to stay silent despite the mom's misuse of their identity.\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to report illegal activities, especially when they're being used without consent. So the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their rights and addressing fraudulent behavior by a family member who has repeatedly shown disregard for their well-being.\n"
