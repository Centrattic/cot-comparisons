She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let me go through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had mental health issues, was in a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. The mom then told others, which the author found out later. The mom didn't apologize properly but gave a fake apology. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name, and there are suspicions of shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude for the support during their mental health struggles and the mom's unethical behavior. They want to know if they're in the wrong for reporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions: misuse of the author's identity, potential tax fraud, and unlicensed business practices. Legally, if the mom is using someone else's identity without consent for business, that's a big issue. The author might have a legal right to report this, especially if they're not involved in the business and it's being done fraudulently.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The author is conflicted due to past support from the mom. However, the mom's past betrayal with the psychiatric history disclosure and lack of sincere apology might make the author less obligated to protect her now.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to report someone who's wronged you? If the mom is engaging in illegal or unethical activities, the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting it. However, there's a personal relationship aspect, but the law doesn't require someone to protect others from their own unethical actions.\n\nSo, considering the facts, the author is not in the wrong. They have a responsibility to report illegal activities, even if done by a family member. The mom's past actions don't necessarily negate the author's right to act in accordance with the law.\n"
