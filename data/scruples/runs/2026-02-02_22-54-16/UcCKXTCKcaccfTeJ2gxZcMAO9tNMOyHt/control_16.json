She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. She broke her son's trust by sharing his mental health issues without permission, and now he's found out she opened a business in his name with possible shady tax practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the son's name without consent for a business, that's likely illegal. Identity theft or fraud could be involved. Turning her in might be the right thing legally. But the son has been living with her, receiving support, which complicates things morally. He might feel indebted, but the mom's actions were unethical and possibly illegal. The mom's betrayal of trust by sharing his private info is another layer. \n\nThe son's mental health struggles add context. He might be in a vulnerable position, but that doesn't excuse illegal actions. The mom's behavior, including not taking responsibility and giving insincere apologies, shows a pattern of manipulation. \n\nSo, is the son in the wrong? Legally, he's not doing anything wrong by reporting crimes. Morally, there's a conflict between gratitude for her support and her harmful actions. However, the mom's misuse of his identity is serious. The son is protecting himself and preventing further harm by turning her in. Therefore, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
