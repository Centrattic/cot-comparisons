She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves the mother being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and having bipolar disorder. The author told their mom about their mental health issues, which the mom then shared with others, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name with possibly illegal activities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mother is using the author's name without consent and committing tax evasion or other illegal activities, that's a crime. The author isn't necessarily at fault here. The mother's actions are unethical and possibly illegal regardless of their personal relationship. The author might be a victim in this case, especially since the business was started in their name without permission. \n\nBut there's also the emotional side. The author has stayed with their mom, possibly out of gratitude, and the mom has a history of betrayal. The author might feel conflicted between loyalty and the need to do what's right legally. The mother's manipulation and lies complicate things. The author might be trying to protect themselves from legal repercussions if the business is found out. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author isn't doing something wrong by exposing illegal activities. The mother's actions are the main issue here. The author is considering reporting a crime, which is their right, even if the person is a family member. The fact that the mom has a history of not taking responsibility adds weight to the author's decision. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for reporting their mom if the mother is indeed engaging in illegal activities under the author's name. The key factors are the illegality of the actions and the mother's lack of accountability. The author's past relationship and the mom's betrayal don't absolve the mother's actions, so the author isn't wrong to take action.\n"
