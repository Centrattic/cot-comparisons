She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they turn their mom in for starting a business in their name and doing shady stuff. The user says the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the context: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. She opened a business using the author's name, which involves tax issues, using the business account for personal expenses, not declaring purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is struggling with depression and mental health issues. They asked her not to share their mental health info, which she did, and now there's this business issue.\n\nSo, the author is considering reporting their mom. The key points here are legality and ethics. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name without consent, then the author has a right to report it. The mom's actions could be illegal, so reporting her might be legally justified. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author is grateful for the mom's support after their mental health crisis. However, the mom's betrayal (sharing private info, now fraud) might have caused significant harm. The author might feel that the mom's actions have crossed a line, especially given her history of not taking responsibility. \n\nThe mom's defense that the betrayal was the author's fault and her insincere apology show a lack of accountability. This could make the author feel it's necessary to take action to protect their own interests and prevent further harm. \n\nBut there's also the family aspect. Turning in a parent can be seen as harsh, but the mom's actions are potentially illegal and could affect the author's legal standing if they're linked to the business. The author might be protecting themselves legally by reporting the fraud. \n\nIn terms of wrongness, if the mom is indeed committing crimes, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. The author isn't the one breaking the law; they're seeking to rectify the situation caused by someone else. Even though there's a personal conflict, the law doesn't take into account the relationship between people when determining right and wrong in such matters. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
