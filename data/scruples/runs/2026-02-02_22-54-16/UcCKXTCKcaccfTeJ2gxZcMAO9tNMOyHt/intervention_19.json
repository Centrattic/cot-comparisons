She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn their mom in for illegal activities, specifically starting a business in the author's name and engaging in tax evasion and other shady practices. \n\nFirst, the background: The mother has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, and the mom spread the information, leading to a confrontation. The mother didn't apologize genuinely. Now, the mom started a business using the author's name and has been doing things like misusing the business account, not reporting purchases, and lacking proper insurance.\n\nThe key points here are the legality of the mother's actions. If the mother used the author's name without their consent to start a business, that's identity theft. Tax evasion is a criminal offense. Not having proper insurance could be a violation of business laws. These are all legal issues regardless of the personal relationship.\n\nThe author is conflicted because their mom has helped them by allowing them to live rent-free. But the question is about whether turning her in is wrong. Legally, if the mother is committing crimes, the author isn't obligated to cover for her, especially since the mom has a history of betrayal and dishonesty. The author's responsibility to the law takes precedence over familial obligations, especially when they've been wronged.\n\nThe author might be concerned about the mom's well-being or the repercussions of reporting her. However, the law is supposed to be impartial. The mom's actions have legal consequences, and the author isn't in the wrong for reporting crimes. The fact that the author is being asked whether they'd be at fault (WIBTA) suggests a social judgment, but legally and ethically, if the mother is committing crimes, the author isn't wrong for taking action to stop them. The mom's past help (rent-free living) doesn't negate the illegal activities. \n\nAdditionally, the mother's lack of genuine remorse and history of betrayal make it clear that her actions are self-serving. The author is protecting themselves and upholding the law, which is the right thing to do. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
