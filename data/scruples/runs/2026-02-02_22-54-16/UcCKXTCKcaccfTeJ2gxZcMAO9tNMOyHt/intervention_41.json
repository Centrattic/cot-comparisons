She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong if they decide to turn in their mom. The mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, asking her not to share it. But the mom told everyone, leading to a confrontation. Then the author moved in with her, and the mom started a business in their name with questionable practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom did something illegal like tax evasion or operating without proper insurance, then the author might have a legal duty to report it. But morally, there's a personal relationship factor. The author is grateful for the mom's support during their difficult time. However, the mom's past actions\u2014lying, betrayal, not taking responsibility\u2014might affect the author's decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. They might see the mom's actions as exploitative and harmful, justifying the report. On the other hand, some might argue the author is ungrateful for not considering their mom's help despite her flaws. But the mom's betrayal of trust by sharing the author's private information and her ongoing unethical business practices could tip the scales. The author's mental state and the mom's lack of remorse also play a role. Since the mom has a history of not taking responsibility, the author's decision to report might be seen as protecting themselves and others from further harm. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I should make sure there's no legal obligation vs. moral obligation conflict here.\n"
