She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. First, I need to understand the key points here.\n\nThe mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The user has a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The user had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her and she agreed not to tell anyone, but she did. Then, the user confronted her and she didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom started a business in the user's name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe main question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting their mom. Let's break it down. Legally, if someone is committing a crime, even a family member, you might have a duty to report it. However, there's the moral aspect of family obligations. The user is torn between gratitude for the mom's support and the mom's betrayal and illegal actions.\n\nBut the user is the one who might be a victim here. The mom used their name without permission for a business, which is a legal issue. The user might not have known about this business and is now being implicated. In that case, the user might have a legal right to report the fraud and protect their identity. \n\nAlso, the mom's history of lying and narcissism suggests she might not have considered the consequences for her child. The user's decision to report her could be seen as self-preservation and upholding the law, regardless of their past relationship. \n\nSo, morally and legally, the user isn't in the wrong because they're reporting a crime. The mom's actions are the primary issue here. The user's past actions (like living rent-free) don't negate the need to report illegal activities. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
