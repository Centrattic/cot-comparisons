She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and was hospitalized, then moved back in with their mom. They asked her not to tell anyone about their mental health, but she did. Then recently, the mom opened a business in the author's name with some shady tax practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom is operating a business fraudulently, using someone else's name without permission, that's likely illegal. The author might be a victim here. Legally, the author has a right to report illegal activities, especially if they're being used without consent. The mom's actions could be identity theft or fraud.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is torn because their mom has helped them in the past, providing a place to stay rent-free after their mental health crisis. But the mom has a history of betrayal and not taking responsibility. The author's main concern is about doing the right thing despite past support.\n\nSome might argue that the author should handle it privately, maybe confront the mom again. But if the mom is unrepentant and the business activities are illegal, the author has a duty to report it. The mom's betrayal of trust by sharing the author's mental health history also shows a pattern of selfish behavior, which might make the author's decision more about protecting themselves from further harm.\n\nI need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The key points are the mom's illegal activities and the author's right to report them. Even if the mom has been a caregiver, the law doesn't typically consider past good deeds when someone commits a crime. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal actions, especially if they were a victim of identity fraud. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
