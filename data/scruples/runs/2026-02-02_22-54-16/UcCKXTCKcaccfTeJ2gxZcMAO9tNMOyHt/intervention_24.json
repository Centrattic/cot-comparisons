She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complicated because the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and then the mom shared this information without consent, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't sincerely apologize. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom is using the author's name without permission and engaging in illegal business practices, that's a problem. The author might have a legal right to report this, especially since it could affect their own reputation or legal standing. The mom's actions could be fraudulent, which is a criminal offense. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report illegal activities.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The mom has been untrustworthy and has a history of betrayal. The author is in a vulnerable position, having struggled with mental health. The mom's behavior, including not apologizing sincerely, adds to the tension. The author is torn between gratitude for the past support and the harm caused by the mom's actions. However, if the mom's actions are illegal, the author's responsibility might be to report it regardless of their personal relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of whistleblowing. Even within a family, if someone is committing crimes, it might be ethically right to report them. The harm caused by the mom's actions could be more significant legally than the emotional impact of the author's decision. Also, the mom's past behavior suggests she might not take responsibility, making it less likely that she would change without legal consequences.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author's mental state and the history of a complicated relationship could cloud their judgment. However, the key point here is the illegality of the mom's actions. If the author is aware of these illegal activities, staying silent could be seen as complicity, especially if the business is using the author's name, which directly affects the author's legal situation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to report their mom. The decision to turn her in is about addressing illegal actions and protecting their own interests, given the mom's history of betrayal and lack of accountability. The legal obligation to report crimes outweighs the personal relationship in this case.\n"
