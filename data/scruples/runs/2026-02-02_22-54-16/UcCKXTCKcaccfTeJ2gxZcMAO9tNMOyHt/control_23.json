She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and bipolar. She was told not to share the person's hospitalization but did anyway, which led to a confrontation. Now, the mom started a business in the person's name with possible tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether using someone else's identity for a business is illegal. If the mom used the person's name without their consent, that's fraud. Even if the person lived with her rent-free, that doesn't give her the right to use their identity. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the person if the business is involved in tax evasion or other illegal activities. \n\nThe person is concerned about their mental health and the complicated relationship. They might feel conflicted because their mom helped them during a vulnerable time. But legally, the mom's actions are likely unethical and possibly criminal. The person isn't at fault for reporting illegal activities, especially if they weren't involved in or aware of the business. The mom's betrayal and lack of remorse make it harder to justify not taking action. The person's right to protect their identity and legal standing should outweigh past favors. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
