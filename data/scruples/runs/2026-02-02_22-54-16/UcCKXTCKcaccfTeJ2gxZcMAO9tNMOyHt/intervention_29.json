She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is asking whether it's wrong for them to turn in their mom, given the mom's actions and their own experiences.\n\nFirst, the background: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on-again, off-again. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. The mom then told others, which the author felt was a betrayal. The mom didn't apologize sincerely and shifted blame onto the author. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe author is considering reporting their mom. The question is whether they're in the wrong to do so, despite the mom's past support (like letting the author live rent-free).\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions versus the author's potential actions. The mom has a history of unethical behavior, including lying and possibly illegal activities. The author is now facing a situation where their name is being used without consent for a business that's not up to legal standards. The author is considering reporting this to authorities.\n\nMoral and legal aspects: Legally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities using the author's name, then the author could be implicated if they don't report it. From a legal standpoint, you have a responsibility to not be complicit in crimes, even if you have a personal relationship with the person involved. So, if the author knows about the illegal activities and doesn't report them, they might be considered an accomplice, depending on their level of involvement. However, the author says they didn't know about the business until recently, so they might not be complicit. But using someone's name without consent is identity theft, which is a crime. So the mom is at fault here.\n\nMoral standpoints: The author has a complicated history with their mom, but the mom's actions here are illegal and could harm the author. If the author reports their mom, they might be protecting themselves and upholding the law, even if the mom has a history of being untrustworthy. On the other hand, the author might feel conflicted because the mom provided some support during their mental health crisis. However, the mom's betrayal and lies have already damaged the trust, and the author is now trying to protect themselves from further harm.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom, especially since the mom is the one who engaged in illegal activities and used their name without consent. The author's actions are more about self-preservation and preventing potential legal issues for themselves. The mom's past support doesn't absolve her of her current wrongdoings, especially if they're illegal. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
