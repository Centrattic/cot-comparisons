She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The background is that the mom has a complicated mental health history, including bipolar disorder, and is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist. The author has a history of strained relationships due to these issues.\n\nFirst, the author was struggling with depression and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told others, which the author felt was a breach of trust. The mom's response was dismissive, not a sincere apology. Now, the mom has opened a business in the author's name, and there are allegations of shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude for the mom's support (living rent-free) and the betrayal and dishonesty. They're considering turning her in, maybe due to legal issues with the business.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong to report their mom. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or other illegal activities, reporting her is the right thing to do. Ethically, there's a conflict between family obligations and legal duties. The author might feel conflicted because of the mom's past help, but the mom's actions (lying, legal violations) could justify the report.\n\nThe author's decision to report could be seen as a moral duty to prevent further harm or legal issues, especially if there's evidence of criminal activity. The mom's mental health issues don't excuse illegal actions. The fact that the mom didn't take responsibility for past betrayals might reduce the author's moral obligation to protect her.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe they should handle it privately first, or there's a family duty to protect. But if the mom's actions are illegal, the duty to society might outweigh family ties.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
