She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is considering turning in their mom because she started a business in their name and might be doing some shady things. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a history of mental health issues and moved back in with their mom after a psychiatric stay. The mom broke their trust by telling others about the author's mental health and then blamed the author for that breach.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to consider turning in their mom. Let's break it down. Legally, if the mom is actually committing crimes (like tax evasion, using business accounts for personal use, not having proper insurance), then the author might have a duty to report that. However, the author is conflicted because the mom provided them with a place to live rent-free during a difficult time. But the mom's actions, like betraying the author's confidence and the business fraud, seem to cross ethical lines.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems manipulative and harmful. She used the author's name without permission, which is a serious issue regardless of their past relationship. The author's mental state and the mom's betrayal of trust add layers of emotional complexity. But legally and ethically, if the mom is indeed engaging in fraudulent activities, the author might have a responsibility to report her, especially since it's in the author's own name and could have legal repercussions for them if the business is discovered and they aren't involved.\n\nThe mom's refusal to take responsibility and her pattern of behavior (not apologizing sincerely) suggest she's unlikely to change. The author is also in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom for support. However, the decision to report someone for legal violations isn't just about personal feelings; it's about the law. If the author is a victim of identity use without consent, that's a crime. So the author isn't in the wrong for acting in their own best interest and possibly upholding the law, even if it's a family member involved. The emotional debt from the mom providing shelter doesn't necessarily negate the wrong done by the mom using the author's name fraudulently. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
