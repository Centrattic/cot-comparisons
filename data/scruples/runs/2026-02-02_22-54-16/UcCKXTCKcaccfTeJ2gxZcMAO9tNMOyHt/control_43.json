She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist with bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had to be hospitalized for depression two years ago and told their mom about it. They moved back in and live rent-free, which they're grateful for. Then, the mom told everyone about the hospitalization, which the author found hurtful. The mom blamed the author for her feelings and gave a non-sincere apology.\n\nNow, the author discovered the mom started a business in their name six months ago and might have done some shady things with taxes, using the business account for personal expenses, not declaring international purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is torn between turning her in and feeling grateful for the help during their mental health crisis.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the mom's actions and the author's potential response. The mom obtained the author's identity without permission to open a business, which is a legal issue\u2014identity theft. Then there are possible tax fraud implications. The mom's history of lying and manipulation adds context. The author is considering reporting her, which would be a legal action against the mom for these offenses. \n\nThe author is in a difficult position because the mom provided support during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's actions of using the author's name and committing possible fraud are serious crimes. The author isn't at fault for being in a bad situation; they're being asked to weigh their gratitude against the illegal actions the mom took. The mom's lack of remorse and tendency to blame others might make the author feel justified in taking action. \n\nLegally, using someone's identity without consent is wrong, and if the mom is indeed committing fraud, then the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. The mom's past behavior might have contributed to the author's decision, but the act of turning her in is about rectifying the misuse of identity and potential illegal activities, not about revenge. The author's gratitude is mixed with the need for justice or protecting themselves from future issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for turning their mom in. It's a matter of addressing the illegal actions, even if the mom helped them before. The mom's actions were unethical and possibly criminal, so the author's decision is justified. The answer should be B.\n"
