She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is pretty complicated. The mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship with her, which has led to periods of not speaking. \n\nThe author had a mental health crisis and was hospitalized, then told their mom. The mom broke confidentiality and told everyone. The author confronted her, and the mom didn't genuinely apologize. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name and may be doing some shady tax stuff. The author is torn about whether to report her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The mom used the author's name without permission, which is a legal issue. Fraud, identity theft, tax evasion\u2014those are serious matters. If the mom is committing crimes, then the author has a right to report her. The author is considering doing this despite the mom's past support. However, the author is also in a vulnerable mental state and has a complicated history with their mom. \n\nBut the key points here are about legal wrongdoing. The mom's actions are illegal, and the author is a victim of identity theft. Reporting a crime isn't a betrayal of past kindness; it's about addressing the law. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their identity and report illegal activities. The mom's past behavior (lying, narcissism) might explain why she did this, but the author isn't responsible for her actions. \n\nAdditionally, the author isn't seeking revenge; they're addressing a legal issue. So, the answer should be B (no), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
