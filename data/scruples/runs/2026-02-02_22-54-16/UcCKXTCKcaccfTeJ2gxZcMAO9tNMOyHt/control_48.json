She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom is described as a narcissist with bipolar disorder, and she's a compulsive liar. They have a strained relationship with periods of not speaking.\n\nThe author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told only their mom. They moved back in and lived rent-free. The mom broke the author's confidentiality by telling everyone, which the author confronted. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with some shady practices, like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in and considering what they've done for them. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the mom is committing fraud by using the author's name without their consent, that's illegal. The author might have a legal duty to report this, especially since they didn't consent. However, the author has been living with her and receiving support. But the mom's actions here are potentially criminal, and the author is a victim of identity misuse.\n\nThe mom's history of lying and manipulation adds context. The author's mental health history and the mom's betrayal of trust might make the situation more about self-protection. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the mom is committing crimes. However, there's a moral dilemma about betraying someone who provided shelter, but the mom's actions here could affect the author legally if the business is in their name. If the authorities trace the business to the author, they might be implicated. But if the mom did it without the author's knowledge, the author could be a victim, not a perpetrator.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author might need to report to protect themselves from being associated with the illegal activities. Ethically, it's about right and wrong actions. The mom violated the author's trust multiple times, and this latest act is a serious one. The author's decision to report might be justified to prevent further harm, especially if the mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action to protect themselves and stop the mom's illegal activities, despite the complicated history.\n"
