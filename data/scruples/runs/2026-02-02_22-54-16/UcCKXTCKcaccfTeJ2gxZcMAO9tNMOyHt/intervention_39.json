She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complicated with a lot of emotional and legal factors.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist with bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and moved in with their mom after a psychiatric stay. The mom broke confidentiality, which the author took issue with. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name, which seems to involve unethical or illegal tax practices.\n\nThe key points here are: the mom's actions (using the author's name without permission, tax evasion, lack of insurance) could be illegal. The author is considering reporting her, which would be a legal action. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so, despite the mom helping them when they were vulnerable.\n\nMoral vs legal: Legally, using someone's identity for a business is a fraud. So turning her in would be the legal right thing. But morally, the author might feel conflicted because their mom helped them during a tough time. However, the mom's actions were harmful (breaching trust, lying) and now potentially illegal. The author's duty to the law might override the debt of gratitude.\n\nAlso, the mom's apology was insincere, indicating she doesn't take responsibility. The author might not owe her loyalty if she's not being ethical. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her, as they're upholding the law and protecting their identity.\n"
