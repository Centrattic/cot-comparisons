She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. They moved back in with her, who provided housing without rent. The author trusted her not to share this personal information, but the mom did, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize sincerely.\n\nNow, the mom started a business under the author's name, which has some illegal or unethical practices\u2014like tax issues, using business accounts for personal expenses, not declaring overseas purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLegally, if the mom is committing fraud or other crimes by using someone else's name and not following tax laws, then the author has a duty to report that. Even though the mom provided housing, that doesn't make the illegal activities okay. The author might be a victim here, especially since their name is being used without consent. \n\nEthically, the mom's betrayal and lack of remorse add context. The author might feel conflicted due to the mom's past support, but the illegal actions are separate. The mom's actions could harm the author if the business is investigated and their name is involved. Reporting might be in the author's best interest to protect their own reputation and legal standing.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning in the mom, especially since the mom's actions are illegal and could have serious consequences. The previous relationship issues don't justify the illegal business practices. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
