She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and bipolar. She also broke the author's trust by spreading their private information about their hospitalization. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name with questionable practices like tax evasion, using the business account for personal use, and not having proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author's mom used their identity without consent to start a business, which is a form of identity theft. That's illegal regardless of their personal relationship. The mom's actions are fraudulent, and the author didn't authorize any of this. Even if the author has been staying with her rent-free, that doesn't mean they agreed to have their name used for a business. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with depression and has a complicated relationship with their mom. They might feel conflicted because their mom provided them a place to stay during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's betrayal of trust by revealing the author's hospitalization and now this business issue complicates things. The author is considering reporting her, which could have legal consequences for the mom.\n\nThe key points here are the unauthorized use of the author's identity and the fraudulent business practices. Legally, the author has the right to report identity theft and fraud. Ethically, the author might feel conflicted, but the mom's actions are clearly on the wrong side. The author is not in the wrong for trying to protect their identity and report illegal activities. The fact that the mom has a history of narcissism and lying doesn't excuse her actions, but it does explain why she might do this without considering the consequences for the author.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in reporting their mom because the mom's actions are illegal and unethical, regardless of their personal history. The author's mental health struggles and the mom's past support don't negate the need to address the current fraud and identity theft.\n"
