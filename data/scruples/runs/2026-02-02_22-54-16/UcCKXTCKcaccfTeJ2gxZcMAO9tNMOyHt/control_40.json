She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let's break this down. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then shared it with everyone. The author confronted her, and she blamed them and gave a non-sincere apology. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and is doing some shady tax stuff, using the business account personally, not reporting overseas purchases, and lacking insurance.\n\nFirst, the legal angle: if the mom opened a business in the author's name without their consent, that's identity theft or fraud. The author has a right to report that, regardless of their relationship. The mom's actions are illegal, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking legal recourse here.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author is grateful for the mom's help with housing but is also a victim of the mom's lies and betrayal. The mom's behavior, including not taking responsibility and insincere apologies, shows a lack of remorse. The author's decision to report them isn't about revenge but about rectifying a wrong. Since the mom has a pattern of harmful behavior, the author's action is justified to protect themselves and address the legal violations.\n\nAlso, the mom's mental health diagnosis (bipolar) might contribute to her behavior, but that doesn't excuse illegal actions. The author's own mental health struggles don't obligate them to tolerate their mom's crimes. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
