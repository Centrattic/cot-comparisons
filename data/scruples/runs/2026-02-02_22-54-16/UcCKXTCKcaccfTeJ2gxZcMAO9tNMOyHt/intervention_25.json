She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom, and moved in with her. The mom then told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues. The author is torn about whether turning her in is the right move.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or other crimes by using the author's name and not following tax laws, then the author might be protected if they report it. The author isn't the one committing the crimes, so they aren't aiding or abetting. The mom's actions are her own, and the author might not be aware of all the specifics, but if they found out, they have a responsibility to prevent potential harm from her actions.\n\nEthically, the author is in a tricky spot because their mom helped them during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's betrayal and lack of accountability have already strained their relationship. The author's mental health and safety might be at risk if they don't take action. The mom's history of dishonesty and manipulation adds to the complexity. If the author is being used without consent for illegal activities, that's a serious issue.\n\nThe author's decision to confront the mom before and now considering legal action shows a level of responsibility. They might be trying to protect their own reputation and prevent legal repercussions. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the author if discovered by authorities, so reporting might be necessary self-protection.\n\nBut there's also the emotional angle. The author feels grateful for the support but is hurt by the mom's betrayal. They might feel conflicted about \"turning her in,\" which could be seen as a family issue. However, family dynamics shouldn't override legal obligations. If the mom is breaking the law, the author isn't bound to protect her just because they are related.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are trying to address a situation where someone else is committing potential crimes, and they have a right to protect themselves legally. The mom's actions are her own, and the author's decision to report her is about preventing further harm, not revenge. So the answer should be B.\n"
