She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is considering turning in their mom because she opened a business in their name and may be doing tax-related shady stuff. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The user has a troubled relationship with her, has been living with her rent-free after a mental health crisis, and she betrayed their trust by telling others about their psychiatric stay.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting their mother. The mom's actions\u2014starting a business without the user's consent and potentially breaking tax laws\u2014could be illegal. If the user didn't authorize the business or her financial practices, then the mom may have committed fraud or identity theft. The user has a right to report illegal activities, especially if they were done without consent.\n\nBut the user is conflicted because their mom has provided support during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's betrayal and lack of remorse (as described) might reduce the user's obligation to protect her. The key here is the legality of the mom's actions. If the business is indeed fraudulent or illegal, then reporting her isn't wrong. The user isn't responsible for their mom's actions, even if they've had a complicated relationship. The user's well-being and right to legal recourse should be considered. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong."
