She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is fickle, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then spread the information. The author confronted her, and she gave a dismissive apology. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax evasion and lack of proper insurance.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author has a moral or legal obligation to report their mother despite the mom's past behavior. Legally, using someone's name without permission is identity theft, which is a crime. If the mom operated a business under the author's name without consent, that's definitely illegal. Also, tax fraud and not having proper insurance are serious violations. The author might have a right to report her because they're being used without consent and potentially involved in illegal activities.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The author is living with their mom rent-free after the mental health episode. They feel torn because of the mom's support during a vulnerable time. However, the mom has a history of betrayal and not taking responsibility. The author's trust has been broken multiple times, so maybe they feel justified in protecting themselves now.\n\nMoral judgment isn't straightforward. Even though the mom helped them, she did so with a history of lying and betraying their trust. The author is not at fault here. The mom's actions are the ones that are questionable and possibly illegal. The author's decision to report her would be about correcting the misuse of their identity and stopping unethical practices, regardless of their past relationship issues.\n\nAlso, the mom's response to the author's trust being broken was to blame the author, which shows a lack of accountability. The author's responsibility is to address the harm being caused by the mom's current actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice or protection here. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
