She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is a bit complicated. The user has a mom with mental health issues and a history of lying and narcissism. The user told their mom about their psychiatric hospitalization, asked her not to share, but she did. Then later, the mom started a business in the user's name with possible tax issues and other legal problems.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions: she's using the user's name without permission for a business that's not compliant. That's definitely illegal. The user is concerned about the shady business practices, like tax evasion and improper insurance. Those are legal violations. The user is considering turning her in because of these issues.\n\nBut there's the emotional aspect too. The mom has been supportive by letting the user live rent-free after their mental health crisis. The user feels conflicted between the mom's past support and her current illegal actions. The user also mentions the mom's lack of remorse for betraying their trust before, which makes them doubt she'll take responsibility now.\n\nSo, legally, using someone's identity for business without consent is theft of identity and fraud. Plus, tax evasion is a criminal offense. Turning her in would be reporting a crime. But the user is worried about being ungrateful for the help they received. However, the mom's actions in the business are illegal regardless of the past support. The user's well-being is also a factor here. They had a mental health crisis, and the mom's betrayal before might have contributed to their stress.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The mom is committing crimes. 2) The user didn't know about the business until now. 3) The user is considering reporting her despite the mom's past support.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for reporting a crime? Probably not. Even if the person has been a caregiver, if they're committing illegal activities, the law applies regardless of personal relationships. However, there's the ethical dilemma of reporting someone who provided support. But given that the mom is using the user's identity and committing fraud, the user has a right to protect their identity and legal standing. The mom's prior betrayal might also justify the user's decision to report her now, especially if they can't trust her.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're reporting a crime that's affecting them directly, even though there's a personal connection.\n"
