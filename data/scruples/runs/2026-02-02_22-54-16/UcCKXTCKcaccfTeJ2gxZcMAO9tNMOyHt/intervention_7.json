She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated relationship with a mother who has mental health issues, is a compulsive liar, and a narcissist. The author was struggling with depression, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then spread the information. Later, the mom opened a business in the author's name with some questionable practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. The mom opened a business in the author's name without permission, which is a legal issue. Using someone's identity without consent is illegal, regardless of the relationship. The mom's actions could lead to fraud or identity theft charges. Additionally, the shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance are separate legal issues that the author might want to report.\n\nEthically, the author is torn between gratitude for the mom's support during their mental health crisis and the betrayal of trust and the mom's deceitful behavior. The mom's history of not apologizing sincerely and violating the author's privacy by spreading the mental health information shows a pattern of harmful behavior.\n\nThe author's consideration to report the mom is based on the legal wrongs committed. Even though the mom provided a place to live, the illegal actions are separate from the personal relationship. The decision to report someone for illegal activities is not inherently wrong, especially if it's to protect oneself from further harm or legal consequences.\n\nHowever, the author might feel conflicted due to the personal history. But legally and ethically, if someone uses another person's identity and breaks the law, the victim is within their rights to report them. The author isn't at fault for seeking justice for these actions, even if it's their parent. The key here is distinguishing between personal grievances and legal obligations. The mom's actions are criminal, and the author has a right to protect their identity and legal standing.\n"
