She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The background is that the mom is a narcissist with bipolar disorder, has a history of lying, and betrayed the author by sharing their private mental health information. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and possibly engaged in tax evasion or other shady practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting it, especially if they're not involved in the illegal activities. However, there's the emotional and familial aspect. The author lives with her, she's helped them during a vulnerable time, and they have a complicated relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the mom broke confidentiality, showed no genuine remorse, and is possibly breaking the law. The author is considering reporting her. From a legal standpoint, if the author isn't complicit, they might have a duty to report illegal activities. But ethically, there's a conflict between family loyalty and justice. However, the mom's actions were harmful, and her betrayal might mitigate the author's loyalty. The author's mental health struggles and the mom's lack of genuine apology also play a role. So, the author might not be in the wrong for acting in their own protection and upholding legal standards, despite the family ties.\n"
