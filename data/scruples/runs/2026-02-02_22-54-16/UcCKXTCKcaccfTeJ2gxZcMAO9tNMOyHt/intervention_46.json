She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is considering turning in their mom because she opened a business in their name and might be doing shady tax stuff. They have a complicated relationship; the mom is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The user has a history of mental health issues and moved back in with her after a psychiatric ward stay.\n\nFirst, the mom broke a trust by telling others about the user's mental health. Then, she opened a business using the user's name without consent. The user is torn between gratitude for the support and the betrayal. \n\nLegally, using someone's name without permission for a business is a serious issue. The mom might be committing fraud or identity theft. The user has a right to report this as it's illegal. The mom's past behavior (lying, not taking responsibility) suggests she might not stop. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting their identity and reporting the crime. The answer should be B.\n"
