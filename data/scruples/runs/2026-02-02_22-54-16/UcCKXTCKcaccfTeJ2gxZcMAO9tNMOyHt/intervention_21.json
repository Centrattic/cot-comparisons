She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then told everyone. The author confronted the mom, who blamed the author and gave a half-hearted apology. Now the mom has started a business in the author's name and is doing some shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nThe author is considering turning in their mom and is asking if they'd be in the wrong for doing so. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they're asking for confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom is using the author's name without permission for a business and engaging in fraudulent activities (like tax evasion, not claiming purchases, etc.), then the author might have a legal right to report this. The mom could be committing identity theft or fraud, which are crimes. The author isn't the one committing the crimes; the mom is. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong if they report the mom to stop illegal activities.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The mom has a history of betrayal and insincerity, but she's also provided a place for the author to stay rent-free during their recovery. However, the author's well-being and the consequences of the mom's actions might take precedence. The mom's actions could lead to legal trouble for the author if the business is in their name. By not reporting, the author could be complicit, or at least not taking responsibility to prevent harm. On the other hand, the author has a history of a strained relationship and the mom's lack of accountability.\n\nBut the key here is that the author isn't the one breaking the law. They were used without their consent, and their name is being misused. Reporting the mom would be the right thing to do to stop the illegal activities and protect the author's identity and legal standing. The fact that the author has a complicated relationship with their mom doesn't make them complicit in the crimes. So, ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom. They're trying to rectify a wrong done to them and prevent further harm.\n"
