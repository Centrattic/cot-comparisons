She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complex with a lot of emotional and ethical factors.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then told everyone, breaking the author's trust. The mom's response was dismissive and not a sincere apology. Now, the author discovered the mom opened a business in their name with potential illegal or unethical practices like tax evasion and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is considering turning her in but is conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay rent-free. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions: using the author's name for a business, possible illegal activities, and the betrayal of trust. The author is in a vulnerable position, having mental health issues and relying on their mom. The mom's history of lying and manipulation complicates things. \n\nLegally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities, especially using someone else's name, the author might have a right to report it. The author isn't the one committing the crimes; the mom is. The mom's betrayal and lack of accountability could justify the author taking action to protect themselves, especially if the illegal activities could affect the author's legal standing. \n\nEthically, the author is torn between gratitude for the support (rent-free stay) and the harm caused by the mom's actions. However, the mom's actions in starting the business without consent and the previous betrayal might override the gratitude. The author isn't at fault for wanting to stop illegal activities, especially since they were used without their knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle it privately first, maybe confront the mom again, but given the mom's history of not taking responsibility, that might not be effective. The author's safety and legal protection are also important. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely not in the wrong for reporting their mom, given the mom's actions and the potential legal issues. The author is protecting themselves from being complicit in the mom's actions and seeking justice for the betrayal. So the answer should be B.\n"
