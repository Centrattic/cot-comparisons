She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with mental health issues and possible legal issues.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissistic, which affects the relationship. The author has mental health struggles and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then shared this information with others, leading to a breach of trust. The mom's behavior here is harmful, and she doesn't show genuine remorse, which is a red flag.\n\nNow, the mom opened a business in the author's name and seems involved in tax evasion and other unethical practices. The author is considering reporting her. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nLegally, if the mom is using the author's name for fraudulent activities, the author could be implicated. The author might have a duty to report this to protect themselves legally. Ethically, the author's trust was already broken, and the mom's actions are self-serving and harmful. The author has a right to protect their own name and legal standing. \n\nThe user mentioned that the author is grateful for the mom's support but that the mom's betrayal was significant. The decision to report might be a necessary step, even if it causes family conflict. The author's mental health history adds context but doesn't obligate them to stay silent about illegal actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report their mom. They're trying to protect themselves from legal repercussions and prevent further harm. The mom's actions are the primary issue here.\n"
