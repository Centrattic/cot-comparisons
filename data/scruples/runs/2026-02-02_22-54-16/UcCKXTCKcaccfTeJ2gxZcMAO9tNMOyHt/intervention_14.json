She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is complex with a lot of personal history.\n\nFirst, the mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom, and moved back in. The mom violated their trust by spreading the information. Then the mom started a business in the author's name with questionable practices. The author is conflicted about reporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here: the mother's actions are harmful and possibly illegal. The author is considering reporting her, which could be seen as a responsible action given the mom's behavior. However, the author feels grateful for the support provided. But the mom's betrayal and deceit seem significant. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and others from potential legal issues caused by the mom's business. The mother's lack of remorse and pattern of harmful behavior justifies the author's decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
