She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is complex, involving a strained relationship with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of lying and narcissism.\n\nFirst, the mother started a business in the author's name without their consent. Using someone's identity without permission is fraudulent and illegal. That's a clear legal issue. Then there's the aspect of the business being shady\u2014tax evasion, using business funds for personal use, and lacking proper insurance. These are potential legal violations. The author's mom also broke the trust by sharing the author's sensitive mental health information, which is another ethical issue.\n\nThe author is torn because their mom has provided housing during a difficult time. But the mom's actions have been harmful and deceptive. The key point here is whether the author is legally and morally obligated to remain silent about the fraud. Legally, reporting fraud is a civic duty, and allowing someone to use your identity for illegal activities could implicate the author. Ethically, the author is being wronged, and the mother's manipulative behavior (gaslighting the author into thinking the betrayal was their fault) complicates the relationship.\n\nThe mother's actions are self-serving, and the author isn't at fault for wanting to report the illegal activities. The author isn't the one committing the fraud; they're the victim. So, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The right choice here would be to report the fraud to protect themselves legally and ethically.\n"
