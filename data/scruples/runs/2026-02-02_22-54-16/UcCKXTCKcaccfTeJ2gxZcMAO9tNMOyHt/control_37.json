She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The daughter had a mental health crisis, admitted herself to a psychiatric ward, and told her mom. The mom then spread the information, which the daughter found out and confronted her. The mom didn't take responsibility and gave a non-apology. Now, the mom started a business in the daughter's name and might be doing some shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, turning someone in for illegal activities is a gray area. If the mom is indeed engaging in fraudulent or illegal behavior, like tax evasion or using someone's identity without consent, then the daughter has a right to report that. But the daughter is torn because her mom provided a place to stay rent-free during a vulnerable time. \n\nHowever, the mom's actions in opening a business under the daughter's name without permission are a significant issue. Using someone's identity without their consent is illegal, regardless of the relationship. The daughter didn't give her permission, so that's a violation of her rights. The mom's past behavior (lying, not taking responsibility) supports the daughter's hesitation to trust her. \n\nThe daughter's potential report is about her mom's misconduct, not out of spite but to address possible legal issues. The mom's actions could have legal consequences, and the daughter is trying to protect herself and possibly others from the mom's fraudulent activities. \n\nSo, the daughter isn't in the wrong for wanting to report her mom if there's evidence of wrongdoing. The mom's behavior is the main issue here. The daughter's gratitude for the shelter is understandable, but it doesn't override the need to act if there's illegal activity involved. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
