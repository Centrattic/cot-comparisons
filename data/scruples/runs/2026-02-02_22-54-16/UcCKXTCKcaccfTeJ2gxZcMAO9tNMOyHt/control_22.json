She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Admitting) scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated relationship with a mother who has mental health issues, is a compulsive liar, and has narcissistic tendencies. \n\nFirst, the mom's actions: she told everyone about the person's psychiatric admission even though they asked her not to. The mom then tried to shift blame onto the person, saying the betrayal was their fault. The mom also started a business in the person's name without their consent, which may involve shady tax practices and lack proper insurance.\n\nThe person is considering turning her in but feels conflicted because their mom has provided them housing for free while they recovered from depression. They're worried about being in the wrong despite the mom's actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the mom is using the person's name without permission, which is illegal. Even if the person has lived with her and she's helped them, that doesn't make the mom right. The person isn't at fault for wanting to report illegal activities, especially when they weren't involved in the business and the mom acted without their consent. The mom's past behavior (lying, betraying trust) adds to the justification. The person is protecting themselves from potential legal issues they didn't agree to and are not responsible for. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
