She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. They have a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. The mom then told others, which was a big betrayal. The author confronted her, but the mom didn't take responsibility and gave a hollow apology. Now the mom has started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is considering turning her in but is conflicted because the mom has provided a place to live. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, legally, if the mom committed fraud or other illegal activities using the author's name, the author might have a responsibility to report it. However, if the author didn't know about these activities and wasn't involved, maybe they aren't at fault. But the mom used the author's name without consent, which could make the author complicit. However, if the author didn't know, maybe they aren't responsible. \n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The mom betrayed the author, lied, and was unapologetic. The author might feel justified in reporting to protect their own name and stop illegal activities. But there's also the aspect of the mom helping them during a vulnerable time. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author knowingly allow or participate in the illegal activities? If not, they might not be at fault. The mom's actions are her own responsibility. The author's intent to report is to prevent harm and legal issues, which is a valid reason. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
