She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation involves a mother with mental health issues and a history of lying, who opened a business in her son's name and potentially engaged in shady tax practices.\n\nFirst, the mother's actions: using her son's name without permission for a business, which is illegal. Then, there's the issue of tax evasion and lack of proper insurance. These are serious legal matters. The son is considering reporting her, which is a legal action. \n\nThe mother's justification for telling others about his mental health crisis is problematic. She violated his trust, which adds to the son's frustration. The dynamic between them is complicated by her narcissistic traits and possible bipolar disorder, which might affect her judgment and accountability.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, using someone's identity without consent is a crime. The son has a right to report illegal activities, even if the person involved is a family member. The fact that the mother previously helped him by letting him stay rent-free doesn't negate her illegal actions. The son's gratitude doesn't obligate him to stay silent about her crimes.\n\nEthically, the son is in a tough spot. He's been a victim of his mother's actions in the past, but now she's committing new crimes. The question is whether he's morally obligated to protect her despite her wrongdoing. Since she broke his trust before, his decision to report her might be seen as a necessary step to protect himself and prevent further harm.\n\nConsidering the mother's lack of sincere apologies and her manipulative behavior, the son's decision to report her could be justified as self-preservation and upholding his own integrity. The mother's actions are independent of their past relationship issues. Legal responsibilities don't depend on personal relationships, so reporting her isn't necessarily the wrong choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for considering turning her in.\n"
