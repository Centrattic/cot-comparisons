She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a troubled relationship with her, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. The mom then shared that information, leading to the author's distrust.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the author's name and seems to be doing shady tax and insurance things. The author is torn about whether to report her. The user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. The mom is using the author's name without their consent, which is a legal issue. Identity theft or unauthorized business registration could be involved. The mom's actions are potentially illegal, especially with tax evasion and lack of proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her, which is a moral and legal decision.\n\nThe author's gratitude for the mom's help (rent-free stay) is mentioned. But the mom's betrayal of trust by spreading the author's private information and the current illegal activities complicate things. The mom's lack of remorse and manipulative behavior (blaming the author for the betrayal) suggest she's unlikely to change.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a duty to report illegal activities if they know about them, especially if they could harm others. The mom's tax fraud and lack of insurance could affect clients or the government. The author's mental state might be a factor, but they are still responsible for legal actions.\n\nHowever, the personal relationship adds emotional weight. The author might feel conflicted due to the mom's past support. But the mom's actions in the business could be more harmful in the long run, both legally and to others involved.\n\nLegally, the author isn't necessarily complicit if they weren't involved in the business and didn't consent. Reporting the mom could prevent further harm. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice or preventing illegal activities, even if it's a family member. The mom's manipulative and narcissistic traits make her less deserving of trust, especially after breaking the author's confidence.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning her in. The answer should be B.\n"
