She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. First, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with long periods of no contact. The author had a mental health crisis and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told only their mom, who then shared that information with others. The author confronted her about this betrayal, and the mom didn't take responsibility, giving a dismissive apology. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name, which seems to involve tax evasion and lack of proper insurance.\n\nSo, the key points here are the legal implications of the mom's actions versus the emotional and personal history between them. Legally, if someone uses another person's name without their consent to start a business and commits fraud or other illegal activities, that's a serious offense. The author might have a duty to report this to protect themselves from legal trouble. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nThe author is torn because the mom helped them by letting them live rent-free. However, the mom's history of lying and lack of remorse might make the author feel justified in reporting her. On the other hand, the act of \"turning in\" a family member can be seen as harsh, especially if there's a history of mutual support. But if the mom is committing crimes, the author could be complicit if they don't report, especially if they knew about the illegal activities. The mom's actions in using the author's name without permission and engaging in tax fraud are definitely unethical and possibly illegal. The author is also in a vulnerable position due to past mental health issues and ongoing trust issues.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom if there's evidence of illegal activities. They have a right to protect their identity and prevent fraud. The mom's past actions, like breaching confidentiality, add to the justification. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
