She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should turn in their mom for opening a business in their name and potentially doing shady things.\n\nFirst, the background: The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and someone with bipolar disorder. They have a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The user had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, and moved back in with her. The mom then told others about the user's mental health, which the user found betrayal. The mom didn't apologize sincerely and even blamed the user for how it affected her.\n\nNow, the mom started a business using the user's name and seems to be doing tax evasion, using business funds for personal use, and lacking proper insurance. The user is torn between turning her in and feeling grateful for her past support.\n\nSo, the user is considering reporting their mom for illegal activities. Legally, if someone uses another person's identity to start a business and commits tax fraud, it's a crime. As a victim of identity theft, the user has a right to report it. However, the user feels conflicted because their mom has helped them in the past.\n\nBut the mom's actions here are illegal, regardless of their personal relationship. The user isn't wrong for wanting to protect themselves and take legal action against someone who has wronged them. The mom's previous help doesn't absolve her of legal wrongdoings. The user's mental health struggles and the mom's betrayal add to the complexity, but the core issue is the illegal business activities.\n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for seeking justice or protection. They're the victim here, so turning in someone who is committing crimes, even a family member, is a valid action. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
