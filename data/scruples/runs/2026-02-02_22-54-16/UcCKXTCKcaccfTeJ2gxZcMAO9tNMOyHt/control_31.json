She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complicated. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, and she's diagnosed with bipolar. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a betrayal. The author confronted her, but she didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name that might be shady with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom used the author's name without permission for a business, that's identity theft, which is illegal. The business activities she's doing\u2014like using business accounts for personal expenses, not reporting purchases, and lacking proper insurance\u2014could be tax evasion or fraud. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for reporting this. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mom's actions are harmful. She's violated trust, used the author's identity, and engaged in potentially illegal activities. The author is in a vulnerable position, having mental health struggles, and has been a victim of betrayal. They're grateful for the support but feel the mom's actions are wrong. \n\nHowever, turning her in could have consequences. The mom might lose her business, face legal trouble, and the author might face backlash from family or others. But the author isn't at fault for the mom's actions. The mom made the choice to use the author's identity and commit fraud. The author is just the victim here, trying to protect themselves and others by reporting the illegal activities. \n\nLegally, the author has the right to report identity theft and fraudulent business practices. They\u2019re not in the wrong for seeking justice. Even though they live with their mom and have a complicated relationship, the law doesn't excuse someone for being a victim of another's crimes. The author is acting in their own defense and to prevent further harm. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
