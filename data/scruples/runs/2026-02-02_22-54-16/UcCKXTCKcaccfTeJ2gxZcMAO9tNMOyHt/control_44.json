She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they would be in the wrong for turning in their mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist, plus she's bipolar. Their relationship is fickle, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, got help, told their mom, and then moved in with her. They asked the mom not to tell anyone, but she did. Then, the mom opened a business in the author's name, and there are some shady tax and insurance issues. The author is considering turning her in but is conflicted because the mom helped them during a tough time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mom's past behavior, the breach of trust regarding the mental health admission, and the potential illegal activities of the business. The author is trying to balance their gratitude for the mom's help with the need to address the possible crimes.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the mom is indeed committing fraud, using someone's identity without consent, and not following tax laws, that's a criminal offense. The author might have a legal obligation to report that, especially if they were used without consent. However, the author's role in this is complicated because they were the one whose identity was used. If the mom opened the business without their knowledge or permission, the author might be a victim, and reporting her could be the right thing to do to stop the illegal activities.\n\nOn the moral side, the author is grateful for the support they received, but the mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation. The author's well-being is also a factor\u2014they've been dealing with depression and have been in a strained relationship. The mom's lack of sincere apologies and tendency to blame others adds to the moral justification for the author taking action.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for turning her in? Well, if the mom's actions are illegal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting them. However, they might have to consider the consequences, like the mom's potential retaliation or the impact on their own life. But legally and ethically, if the author had no part in the illegal activities and was a victim of identity theft, they might have a duty to report it. The fact that the mom used their name without consent is a key point here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They are protecting themselves and upholding the law by reporting the mom's fraudulent activities, especially given the mom's history of dishonesty and the author's lack of involvement in the business."
