She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic where the mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author shared a personal mental health issue with their mom, who then betrayed their trust by telling others. Now, the mom has started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspects. If the mom is operating a business under someone else's name without their consent, that's probably illegal. Using a business account for personal expenses and not reporting purchases could be tax evasion or fraud. The author might be a victim of identity theft or fraud here. Legally, the author might have the right to report this if they have evidence.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is grateful for the support from their mom but has been betrayed before. The mom's behavior, like not apologizing sincerely, suggests she might not take responsibility. The author is in a tough spot between gratitude and protecting themselves. They might feel conflicted but if the mom is engaging in illegal activities, the author isn't obligated to cover for her. \n\nHowever, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider if there's any reason the author would be at fault. If the author didn't know about the business when the mom opened it, maybe they had no prior knowledge of the illegal activities. The author's intent is to report wrongdoing, not out of spite but to stop illegal actions. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If the author was complicit in any way or if the business was set up with the author's consent, that's different. The scenario states that the mom opened it without the author's knowledge, so that's not the case. The key is whether the author is reporting for the right reasons and if they have a duty to report. Legally, individuals are generally encouraged to report crimes, even if they have a personal relationship with the person involved. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're reporting illegal activities, which is their right and possibly their responsibility. The prior relationship doesn't negate their right to act in their own interests and the public's interest against fraud.\n"
