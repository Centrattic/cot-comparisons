She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a history of mental health issues and moved in with their mom, who they trusted to some extent but knew wasn't reliable. The mom breached that trust by telling others about the author's psychiatric admission. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission for a business, that's likely fraudulent. The author has a right to protect their identity and report illegal activities. Even if the mom has been a problematic figure, the law doesn't excuse illegal actions just because of family relationships. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences, and the author isn't in the wrong for seeking to hold her accountable.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay. However, the mom's betrayal of trust by disclosing the author's mental health and the current fraud may tip the scales. The author isn't obligated to protect someone who's harmed them or broken the law. The mom's refusal to take responsibility and her manipulative behavior (like blaming the author for her betrayal) further justify the author's stance.\n\nAlso, the author isn't seeking revenge but rather addressing potential legal issues. The mom's actions could harm others if the business is unscrupulous. Reporting her might prevent further damage. The author's gratitude for the shelter is acknowledged, but it doesn't negate the need to report illegal activities. In such cases, legal obligations often supersede personal relationships, especially when fraud and tax evasion are involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The right choice here is B.\n"
