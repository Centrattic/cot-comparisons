She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and bipolar. The author told her about their mental health issues, and the mom betrayed that trust by telling others. Now the mom started a business in the author's name with some shady practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission for a business, that's probably illegal. Identity theft or fraud? Maybe. Also, the business has tax issues and lacks proper insurance. The author might have legal standing to report this. \n\nThen there's the moral side. The mom was supposed to be a support system but betrayed the author. The author is grateful for the shelter but feels wronged. The mom's actions could lead to legal trouble for the author if the business is illegal. The author might be protecting themselves by reporting her.\n\nBut there's also the relationship aspect. The author has a complicated history with their mom. They might feel conflicted about betraying her. However, the mom's actions have already caused harm, and continuing to let this go could lead to more issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the mom committed crimes using the author's identity, the author isn't at fault for reporting it. Morally, since the mom has a history of betrayal and isn't remorseful, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and legal safety. Plus, the mom's actions could harm the author if not addressed.\n\nSo, answer B, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting themselves from legal issues caused by their mom's actions.\n"
