She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on-again, off-again. The person had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. The mom broke confidentiality by telling everyone. When confronted, the mom was defensive and didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the person's name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe user is torn between reporting her despite her help in the past. The key points here are the mom's breach of trust, the potential illegal activities, and the person's internal conflict about reciprocating the betrayal.\n\nLegally, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion, the person might have a duty to report it, especially if they're aware of the illegal activities. However, there's an emotional aspect too. The mom has a history of betrayal, which complicates the situation. The person might feel conflicted because they're grateful for the past support but hurt by the mom's actions.\n\nEthically, it's about whether the person is obligated to report their mother despite the personal history. If the mom's actions are illegal and could harm others, the moral duty might lean towards reporting. But the person might feel wrong for betraying their mom again, adding to their guilt.\n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between legal obligations and personal ethics. The person isn't necessarily in the wrong for acting in self-defense or preventing further harm, especially if the mom is unrepentant. But there's a risk of being judged for not prioritizing family despite the mom's flaws.\n"
