She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking whether they're in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Their mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. \n\nThe user mentioned that they told their mom about their stay in a psychiatric ward, trusting her a little even though they don't trust her much. Then the mom told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom opened a business in the user's name and seems to be doing shady things, like tax evasion or improper insurance.\n\nThe user is torn because their mom has helped them by letting them live rent-free after their mental health episode. The question is whether turning her in is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mom's actions (starting a business fraudulently, using the user's identity), the potential legal issues (tax evasion, insurance), and the user's gratitude for the help. Also, the mom's past behavior of lying and not apologizing sincerely suggests a pattern of self-centeredness.\n\nLegally, if the mom is using the user's name without consent and committing fraud or tax evasion, that's a problem. The user might have a legal right to report this, especially if they are being used as a front for illegal activities. However, there's also the emotional aspect\u2014gratitude for the support during a tough time.\n\nBut the user might be a victim here, as their identity is being misused. The mom's history of betrayal (telling others about the user's private matter) shows a lack of trustworthiness. The user's action of reporting could be seen as necessary to protect their own legal standing and prevent further harm. They aren't necessarily the wrongdoer here; they're responding to their mother's actions.\n\nSo, considering the mom's fraudulent activities and the user's right to protect their identity and legal status, the answer would likely be that the user isn't in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
