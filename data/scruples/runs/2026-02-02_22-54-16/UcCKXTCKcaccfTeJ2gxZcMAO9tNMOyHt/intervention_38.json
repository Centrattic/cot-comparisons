She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then broke their confidentiality by sharing it with everyone. The author confronted her, but she didn't take responsibility and gave a dismissive apology. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and is possibly involved in tax evasion and other shady practices.\n\nThe author is considering reporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions. She broke a trust by revealing the author's mental health issue, which is a sensitive matter. Then, she used the author's name without consent for a business, which is likely illegal. The author is in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom for support after their breakdown. \n\nLegally, using someone's name without permission for business purposes is a form of identity theft or fraud, which is a criminal offense. The mom's actions could be considered illegal, so reporting her would be a legitimate action. The author's duty here might be to protect themselves from legal repercussions that they weren't involved in. \n\nThe author's past of living with the mom rent-free doesn't obligate them to cover up illegal activities. The mom's past support doesn't absolve her from legal wrongdoings. The author might be in a bind between gratitude and the need to prevent legal issues tied to their name. \n\nSince the mom is already a compulsive liar and doesn't take responsibility, the author can't trust her to handle the situation. Reporting her would be a way to protect their own legal standing and prevent further harm. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning in their mom for illegal activities, especially when the mom has a history of untrustworthy behavior and the author is being used without consent."
