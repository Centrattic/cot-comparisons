She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The context is complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a history of depression and was hospitalized, then moved in with their mom. They asked her not to share their mental health struggles, but she did, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't take responsibility.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the author's name, which seems to involve unethical or illegal activities like tax evasion and using the business account for personal expenses. The author is conflicted because their mom provided support during a tough time, but her actions are problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom is engaging in fraudulent activities using the author's name, the author could be legally implicated. Even if they didn't know about it, being a named business owner might lead to legal consequences. So, the author might have a duty to report this to avoid being an accomplice, especially if they become aware of the illegal activities.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between loyalty to family and doing what's right. The mom has a history of betrayal and not taking responsibility, which complicates the situation. The author's decision to report her could be seen as necessary to prevent further harm, not just to others but also to protect themselves legally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acknowledges the mom's past support. But given the mom's pattern of behavior\u2014lying, betrayal, lack of accountability\u2014it's questionable whether the support was genuine or conditional. The author's mental health struggles and the mom's exploitation of that (using their name for a shady business) add another layer of harm.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop illegal activities that they were unwittingly involved in. They have a right to protect their identity and legal standing. The mom's actions have caused direct harm, so reporting her would be a defense of the author's rights and safety.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
