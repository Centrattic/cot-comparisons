She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The author's mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. She told everyone about the author's mental health issue despite being asked not to, and now she's running a business that might be illegal in the author's name.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions are definitely problematic. She violated the author's trust by sharing private information, which is a big deal. Then she's using the author's name for a business with possible tax and legal issues. That could lead to legal problems for the author, even if they weren't involved. The author is concerned about being implicated in illegal activities, which is a valid worry. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to turn her in. The author is in a tough spot. They've been living with their mom and are grateful for her help, but she's caused a lot of harm. The mom's actions could put the author in legal trouble, which might be a reason to expose her. However, the author might feel conflicted because of their history and gratitude.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion, the author might have a duty to report it to protect themselves and prevent further illegal activities. The mom's betrayal and lack of remorse also play a role here. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions, especially since they were asked not to share the information and the business was opened without consent. \n\nSo, considering the mom's misconduct and the potential legal issues, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to turn her in. They're trying to protect themselves from the consequences of her actions. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
