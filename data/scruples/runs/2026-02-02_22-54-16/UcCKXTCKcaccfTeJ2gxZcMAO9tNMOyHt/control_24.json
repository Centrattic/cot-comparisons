She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: the mother is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar. They've had a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom, who then spread the information. The mom didn't apologize sincerely and instead shifted blame. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities\u2014tax issues, using business funds for personal use, no proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her, feeling conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay rent-free after their hospitalization.\n\nSo, the key points are: the mom violated the author's trust by sharing private information, gave a non-sincere apology, and now is potentially committing fraud using the author's name. The author is torn between gratitude for shelter and the wrong done by the mom.\n\nLegally, if the mom is using the author's name without consent for a business with fraudulent activities, the author might have legal standing to report her. The author's mental health history is part of the context but doesn't necessarily make the author complicit in the fraud. The mom's actions, like tax evasion and misusing business funds, are illegal regardless of their personal relationship. The author might not be directly at fault for the mom's actions, especially if they were unaware and didn't consent to the business setup.\n\nMoral considerations: The author is in a vulnerable position, having struggled with depression and relying on their mom for support. However, the mom's deceit and illegal activities cross ethical lines. The author's decision to report could be seen as protecting their identity and holding someone accountable for wrongdoing, which is a moral duty. On the other hand, there's gratitude for the shelter, but that doesn't excuse the mom's actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might be accused of ingratitude or exploiting the situation, but the mom's actions are independent of the author's gratitude. Also, the author's responsibility might be limited if they weren't involved in the business. The key is whether the author had knowledge and consent. Since the business was opened in their name without consent, the author isn't at fault. The wrong here is primarily on the mother.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong if they report their mom, given the mom's illegal actions and the lack of consent. The author is taking responsibility for their name being used fraudulently and seeking to correct the wrong done to them.\n"
