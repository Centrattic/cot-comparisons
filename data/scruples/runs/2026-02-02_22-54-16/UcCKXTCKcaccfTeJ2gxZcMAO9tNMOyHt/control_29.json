She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The context is that their mom is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. She told everyone about the user's psychiatric admission, which the user had asked her not to do, and when confronted, she blamed the user and gave a non-sincere apology. Now, the mom has started a business in the user's name and is doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from a moral and legal standpoint. Legally, if the mom is running a business under the user's name without their consent and committing tax fraud or other violations, the user might have a legal obligation to report it. Using someone's identity without permission is a crime, and the user could be implicated if they don't act. However, the user might be struggling with loyalty because their mom helped them financially after their hospitalization.\n\nMoral considerations are more complex. The user's mom has a history of betrayal and insincerity. The user's mental health is a factor here\u2014they were in a vulnerable state when they told their mom about their hospitalization. The mom's past behavior shows a pattern of not respecting the user's wishes, which might justify the user's anger and desire to take action.\n\nBut the user might feel conflicted because their mom provided a place to stay. However, that doesn't mean the mom's actions are justified. The user could be in the right to protect themselves from legal issues, even if it means reporting a family member. The mom's actions could lead to legal trouble for the user if they're tied to the business. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to protect their own interests and legal standing.\n\nAlso, the mom's mental health diagnoses might affect her behavior, but that doesn't excuse illegal or unethical actions. The user's responsibility is to their own well-being and legal safety. The mom's past actions (like the betrayal regarding the hospitalization) might erode the user's sense of obligation to protect her from consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the user might need to report the mom to avoid being complicit. Morally, the user has been wronged multiple times, so their decision might be seen as self-preservation rather than betrayal. The answer is probably B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
