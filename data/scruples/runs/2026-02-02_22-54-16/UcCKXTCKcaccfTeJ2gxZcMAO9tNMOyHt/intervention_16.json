She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist, with bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health issue and moved in with her mom, who then told others about their hospitalization. The mom also opened a business in the author's name with possible tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the mom is committing fraud or other illegal activities by using the author's name without permission, then the author might have a legal obligation to report her. Using someone's name without consent for business purposes is fraud. Also, tax evasion and not having proper insurance are illegal. So turning her in could be the right thing legally.\n\nEthically, the situation is complex. The author is grateful for the support during their mental health crisis, but the mom has betrayed their trust multiple times. The mom's actions in creating the business could be harmful to the author, affecting their credit, legal standing, or future opportunities. The author might feel wronged and have a right to protect themselves.\n\nHowever, the author has to weigh the consequences. Reporting the mom could lead to legal consequences for her, which might affect their relationship further. But if the mom's actions are indeed illegal and the author is being used without consent, then it's a matter of personal rights and legal compliance.\n\nAlso, the mom's history of narcissism and lying might mean she's manipulating the author. The author's decision to report her might be a necessary step to protect their own interests, despite the gratitude from past support.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't obligated to protect someone who is violating the law, especially if it harms them. So turning her in isn't necessarily wrong. The author might be in the right to prioritize their own well-being and legal standing.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
