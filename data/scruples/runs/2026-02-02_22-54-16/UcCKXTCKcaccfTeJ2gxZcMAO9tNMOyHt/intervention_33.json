She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and stayed with their mom after a psychiatric hospital stay. They asked her not to tell anyone, but she did, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, using someone's identity without consent is a crime. If the mom opened a business under the author's name, that's identity theft. The author has a right to report this, regardless of their personal relationship. The mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) might show a pattern of manipulation, which could justify the author protecting themselves.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between gratitude for the mom's support and the harm caused by her actions. The author is in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom after a mental health crisis. The mom's actions not only violated trust but also potentially put the author in legal trouble if the business is illegal. The author's decision to report could be seen as self-preservation and upholding the law, even if it strains their relationship.\n\nHowever, the author is torn because the mom has helped them during a difficult time. But the mom's actions in creating the business could lead to serious consequences for the author. The key points are legal wrongdoing by the mom and the author's duty to protect themselves and possibly others from her illegal activities.\n\nThe mom's history suggests she's unlikely to change, so the author might need to take action to prevent further harm. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal activities committed against them. Ethically, it's a tough spot, but the wronged party has the right to seek justice.\n"
