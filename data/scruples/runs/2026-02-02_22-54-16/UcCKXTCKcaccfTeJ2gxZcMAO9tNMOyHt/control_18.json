She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their mom is a compulsive liar and narcissist, with bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The user had a mental health crisis, checked themselves into a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her, living rent-free, and she promised not to tell anyone about their hospitalization. But she did tell everyone, and when confronted, she blamed the user and gave a half-hearted apology. Now, the mom started a business in the user's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nSo, the user is considering turning her in. The key points here are the mom's actions: lying, breaking confidentiality, possible illegal business activities. The user feels betrayed but is also aware that their mom has done things for them, like letting them stay rent-free.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for reporting illegal activities? Well, if the mom is committing crimes (tax evasion, using business accounts for personal use, not having proper insurance), then the user has a responsibility to report that, regardless of their personal relationship. Even if they're family, illegal activities should be addressed. The mom's previous actions (like sharing private info) don't excuse the user from legal obligations. The user is protecting themselves and others from potential legal issues caused by the mom's business. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user feels conflicted because their mom provided support. But the mom's betrayal and dishonesty might make the user less bound by loyalty. Also, by reporting, the user is acting in the interest of legal compliance, not just personal vendetta. The mom's actions in the business could have broader consequences beyond their personal relationship.\n\nSo, considering the mom's possible criminal activities, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting her. The answer should be B (No).\n"
