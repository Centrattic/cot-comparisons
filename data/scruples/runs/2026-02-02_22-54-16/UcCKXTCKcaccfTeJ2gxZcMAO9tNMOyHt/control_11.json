She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on-again, off-again, and the person has been living with her rent-free after being in a psychiatric ward. The mom broke their confidentiality by telling others about their mental health, and now the person found out she started a business in their name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting her due to her past actions versus the fact that she provided support when they were struggling. The key points here are the mom's dishonesty and potential legal issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong to report her.\n\nLegally, if the mom is committing fraud or other crimes, reporting her might be the right thing. The author isn't the one committing the crimes; the mom is. The author's actions are based on self-protection and possibly preventing further harm. The mom's betrayal and lack of remorse might make the author feel conflicted, but legally and ethically, allowing illegal activities to continue could have consequences. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family and past support. The author might feel guilty because the mom helped them when they were in a vulnerable state. But the mom's actions in starting a business under someone else's name without consent is a serious offense, regardless of past help. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions, so turning her in isn't wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking responsibility for their own safety and preventing further legal issues, which is justified given the mom's behavior.\n"
