She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for possibly turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, with a bipolar diagnosis. The author has mental health issues and was hospitalized. They moved in with their mom after that, and the mom broke their confidence by telling others about their hospitalization. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and is doing some shady tax stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name without their consent, that's a crime. The author might have a legal right to report her, especially if they were a victim of identity theft or fraud. The fact that the mom used the author's name without permission is a key point. Even if the author is grateful for the shelter, the illegal activities might outweigh that.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is conflicted because their mom provided a place to stay. However, the mom has a history of betrayal and not taking responsibility. The author's mental health is also a factor\u2014struggling with depression and having a strained relationship. The mom's insincere apology and refusal to take responsibility for her actions (like spreading the author's private information) add to the tension.\n\nThe question is whether turning the mom in is the right thing. Legally, if the mom is in violation of laws, the author isn't wrong for reporting her. Morally, it's about whether the gratitude for the shelter outweighs the harm from her illegal actions. The author might feel conflicted, but if the mom is committing crimes, the author isn't obligated to protect her, especially since the mom has a history of not being trustworthy.\n\nAlso, the mom's actions could put the author in legal trouble if the business is fraudulent. The author might be a victim here, so reporting it could be a way to protect themselves as well. The fact that the mom is a narcissist might mean she's more likely to exploit others, and the author's past experiences suggest they can't trust her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom if the legal violations are substantiated. The situation is complicated, but the key factors are the mom's fraudulent activities and the author's right to seek justice or protect themselves from legal repercussions.\n"
