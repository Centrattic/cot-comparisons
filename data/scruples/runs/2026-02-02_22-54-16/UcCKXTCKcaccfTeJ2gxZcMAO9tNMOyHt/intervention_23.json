She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The context is that the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom, and then found out the mom told everyone, which caused a rift. Now the mom started a business in the author's name with some shady tax and insurance issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the mom is running a business fraudulently using someone else's name, that's illegal. The author might have a right to report this to protect themselves from legal liability. The mom's actions could put the author at risk if the business is involved in any legal issues. \n\nThen there's the dynamic between them. The mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation. The author is in a vulnerable position, having trusted the mom before but being let down. The mom's lack of sincere apologies and tendency to justify her actions (like blaming the author for her betrayal) makes it harder for the author to trust her. \n\nEthically, reporting illegal activities is generally seen as the right thing to do, especially when it puts others at risk. The author might be concerned about their own liability if the business is fraudulent. Even though the mom has provided some support in the past, the author's well-being and legal standing are important factors.\n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. The author might feel conflicted due to past support from the mom. But given the mom's history of dishonesty and self-centered behavior, the author might not have a choice if the mom is engaging in illegal activities. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to report their mom if there's evidence of illegal activity. They're protecting themselves from potential harm. The mom's actions are the root cause here, not the author's decision to report. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
