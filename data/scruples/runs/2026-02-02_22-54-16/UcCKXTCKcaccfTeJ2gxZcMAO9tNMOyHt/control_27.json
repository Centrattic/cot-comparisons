She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering turning their mom in. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, checked into a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. Later, they moved in with her rent-free. The mom then told everyone, which the author was upset about. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business under the author's name and seems to be doing illegal things like tax evasion and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe author is conflicted about reporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the mom's actions versus the author's possible actions. The mom used the author's name without permission for a business and committed possible tax fraud. The author is considering turning her in. \n\nLegally, if someone is using another person's identity for a business without their consent, that's identity theft or fraud. The mom could be facing legal consequences if the author reports her. But the author feels conflicted because their mom has helped them in the past, despite her character flaws.\n\nEthically, is the author wrong for reporting their mom? Well, the mom's actions are illegal. The author is being a whistleblower, even against a family member. However, there's a sense of duty to stop illegal activity, especially if it's harmful. The mom's past behavior doesn't excuse her current illegal actions. The author might feel a sense of obligation due to their past relationship, but the law doesn't consider family ties when it comes to crimes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as not in the wrong because they're reporting a crime. However, some might argue that they could have addressed it through other means, like legal action to remove the business or seek damages. But if the mom is committing crimes that could harm others or the author, reporting her might be necessary.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for reporting their mom for illegal activities. Even though the mom has been a bad parent, the author is acting within legal and ethical boundaries to prevent or address criminal behavior.\n"
