She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with long periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, then moved back in with their mom, who they describe as providing some support. The mom, however, broke confidentiality by telling others about the author's hospitalization. When confronted, the mom shifted blame and gave a non-apologetic apology, which the author found insincere.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the author's name, which has some legal and ethical issues: using the business account for personal expenses, not declaring overseas purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is torn between their gratitude for the support and the potential consequences of reporting their mom.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mom used the author's identity without consent for a business, which is illegal. The author is considering legal action against her for these violations. The mom's past behavior includes betrayal and lack of accountability, which complicates the family dynamics.\n\nLegally, using someone's name without permission to start a business is a form of identity theft. The author has a right to protect their identity and report the misuse. The mom's actions are the primary issue here. The author's mental health history and the support received don't negate the legal wrongs committed by the mom. The author isn't being held in the wrong for reporting these crimes; the mom is. The fact that the mom might have mental health issues doesn't excuse illegal activities, though it might be a factor in her defense. However, the author's responsibility is to address the legal misuse of their identity. So, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
