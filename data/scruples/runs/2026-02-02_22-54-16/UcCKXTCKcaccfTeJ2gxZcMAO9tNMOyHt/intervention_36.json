She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong if they turn their mom in for starting a business in their name and possibly engaging in shady tax practices. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a complicated relationship with her, living with her rent-free after a mental health episode, but the mom broke their trust by telling others about the author's psychiatric admission. Now, the mom is using the author's name for a business with possible legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Using someone's identity without their consent to start a business is illegal, regardless of the relationship. The mom's actions could lead to fraud charges. The author has a right to report this, as it's a legal violation. The fact that the mom helped the author in the past doesn't negate the illegality of her current actions. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation, as shown by the author's trust being broken when she told others about the psychiatric stay. The author might feel that turning her in is the only way to protect themselves from further harm or legal entanglements. The question is whether the author's actions are justified despite the past help. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, which makes sense because the mom's actions are illegal. The author isn't obligated to protect someone who's harmed them, especially when that person is engaging in criminal behavior. The fact that the author is conflicted shows they care, but the law doesn't take into account past favors. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has a moral obligation to their mother, but given the mom's history of manipulation and the potential legal consequences for the author (if they don't report it), the author might actually be protecting themselves as well. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for reporting their mom's illegal activities. The answer should be B.\n"
