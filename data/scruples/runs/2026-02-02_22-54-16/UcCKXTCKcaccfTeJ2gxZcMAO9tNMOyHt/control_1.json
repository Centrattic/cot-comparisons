She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, with a bipolar diagnosis. She's broken trust before by spreading the author's private information. Now, she's opened a business under the author's name and there are tax and legal issues. The author is struggling with whether to report her.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's past behavior and the current legal issues. The author's mom used their identity without permission, which is a serious matter. Even if the author is grateful for the support during their mental health crisis, that doesn't mean they should cover up illegal activities. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences, and the author might be liable if they don't report it. The author's responsibility here isn't just about past kindness but about current laws. The mom's betrayal and dishonesty are part of the context, but the main issue is the illegal business activities. So, the author isn't in the wrong for considering reporting their mom, especially since the mom has a pattern of unethical behavior. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
