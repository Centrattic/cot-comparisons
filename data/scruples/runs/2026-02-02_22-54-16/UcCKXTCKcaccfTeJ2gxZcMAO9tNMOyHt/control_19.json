She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA question) is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. \n\nFirst, the background info: the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar. The author told their mom about their mental health issues and asked her not to share, but she did anyway, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with shady practices like using business accounts for personal expenses, not claiming overseas purchases, and lacking proper insurance.\n\nThe key points here are: the mom used the author's identity without consent, which is illegal. The mom has a history of betraying trust and not taking responsibility. The author is considering reporting her for legal reasons, which might be justified due to the fraud involved. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in. Legally, using someone's identity for a business without their consent is a crime. The mom's actions are fraudulent, so reporting might be the right thing. The author's gratitude for past help is mentioned, but the illegal activities could override that. Also, the mom's lack of remorse and tendency to blame others complicates things. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for wanting to report her because the mom's actions are illegal and deceitful. The author's responsibility to report fraud and identity theft outweighs the previous help. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
