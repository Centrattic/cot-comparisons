She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author was in a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and she spread the information. Then they moved in with her and she started a business in their name with questionable practices.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The mom's actions are definitely problematic. She violated the author's trust by telling others about their mental health, which is a serious breach. Plus, using the author's name for a business without their consent and engaging in shady tax practices could be illegal. The author is struggling with depression and has a complicated relationship with their mom. They feel torn between gratitude and the wrong done to them.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in. Legally, if the mom is using the author's name without permission and committing tax fraud or other illegal activities, the author might have a right to report it. However, the emotional aspect is complex. The author lives with their mom and has been rent-free, which adds a layer of dependency. But the mom's behavior seems manipulative and harmful.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. The author's well-being is important, and if the mom is endangering them through her actions (like legal issues from the business), then reporting might be necessary. The mom's lack of sincere apologies and her tendency to blame the author suggests she's not going to change. The author might be protecting themselves from potential legal trouble or further emotional harm by taking action.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of family and gratitude. The author might feel conflicted about betraying their mom after she provided shelter. But when trust is broken multiple times, especially with lies and possible illegal activities, the ethical responsibility to prevent harm from those actions could outweigh familial ties.\n\nI think the key points are the mom's misuse of the author's identity and possible illegal activities, the prior betrayal of trust, and the author's need to protect their own interests. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking to rectify a situation where their mom has wronged them and may be engaging in criminal behavior. The answer should be B (No), because the author is acting to protect themselves and address the mom's illegal actions, which are separate from their personal relationship.\n"
