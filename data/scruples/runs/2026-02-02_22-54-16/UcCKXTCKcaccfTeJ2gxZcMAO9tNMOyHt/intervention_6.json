She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is complex, involving a strained relationship with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of lying and narcissistic behavior.\n\nFirst, the mother has a history of betraying trust, like sharing the author's private mental health information. The author confronted her about that, and the mother didn't take responsibility. Now, the mother has opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities\u2014like tax evasion and lack of proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her despite the mother's past support, like letting them live rent-free after their hospital stay.\n\nThe key points here are legal and ethical. Legally, if the mother is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name without consent, that's a crime. The author has a right to report illegal activities, even if it's a family member. Ethically, the author might feel conflicted because of their past relationship and the mother's past support. But the mother's actions are harmful and deceptive. The author's well-being and safety are also factors; the mother's behavior has been exploitative.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves from legal liability if the business is indeed illegal. Also, the mother's lack of sincere apologies and consistent betrayal suggests a pattern of harmful behavior. The author's decision to report her is about preventing harm and upholding legal standards, not just revenge. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
