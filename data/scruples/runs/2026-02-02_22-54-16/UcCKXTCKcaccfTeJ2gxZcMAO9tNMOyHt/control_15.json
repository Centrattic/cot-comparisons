She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The key points here are the mom's actions and the daughter's situation.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. She broke the daughter's confidentiality by telling others about her mental health, which is a significant breach of trust. Then, the mom started a business in the daughter's name, which might involve illegal activities like tax evasion or not having proper insurance. \n\nThe daughter is conflicted because her mom has provided her with a place to live rent-free after her mental health crisis. The question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for potentially reporting her mom. \n\nLegally, if the mom is committing crimes under the daughter's name, the daughter could be implicated, even if she didn't know. The daughter might be protecting herself by reporting her mom. However, morally, the daughter is considering cutting ties with someone who helped her during a vulnerable time. \n\nThe main ethical dilemma is between self-protection and gratitude. The mom's actions are clearly harmful and possibly illegal, so the daughter has a right to protect herself. But the daughter is also considering the mom's past support. However, the mom's betrayal was intentional, which complicates things. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting illegal activities. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences regardless of their personal relationship. The daughter's health and safety are priorities here. \n\nIn terms of morality, while the daughter might feel guilty, she's also a victim of her mom's actions. The mom's lack of remorse and history of betrayal make the situation more about self-preservation. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to protect herself from someone who has consistently violated her trust and possibly committed crimes.\n"
