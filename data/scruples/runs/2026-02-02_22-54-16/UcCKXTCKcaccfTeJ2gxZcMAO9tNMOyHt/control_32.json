She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and bipolar. They have a complicated relationship with periods of not speaking. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then told everyone, which upset the author. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name and seems to be doing shady things like tax evasion and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe author is considering turning her in and is asking if they would be in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without their consent to start a business, that's likely illegal. The author might have a legal right to report her because the business is being run fraudulently. The mom's actions could be identity theft or fraud, which the author is being asked to be complicit in by not acting.\n\nBut the author has a complicated relationship. The mom provided a place to live rent-free after the author's hospital stay, which is a significant act of support. However, the mom also betrayed the author's trust by telling others about their mental health, which is a serious issue. The author might feel conflicted between gratitude and the need for justice.\n\nIn legal terms, if the mom is committing crimes under the author's name, the author could be implicated, even if they didn't know. So reporting her might be necessary to avoid legal trouble for the author as well. The mom's actions could lead to the author being investigated or facing consequences if the business is found to be illegal under their name.\n\nAdditionally, the mom's personality (narcissist and compulsive liar) might mean she's unlikely to change her behavior. The author might be protecting themselves legally by reporting her, even if it's hard emotionally. The fact that the mom apologized insincerely shows a pattern of not taking responsibility, which makes it less likely she'll stop if not confronted.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is grateful for the support during their mental health crisis. But in such cases, the law usually requires people to report crimes they're aware of to avoid complicity. So the author isn't just doing it out of spite but to protect themselves and report illegal activity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reporting a crime and protecting themselves from legal repercussions. The mom's actions are illegal, and the author's choice to report her is justified.\n"
