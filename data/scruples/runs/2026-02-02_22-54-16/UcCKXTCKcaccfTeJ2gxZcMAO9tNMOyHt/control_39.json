She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then spread the information. The author confronted her, but she didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is considering reporting her but is conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay rent-free. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they turn her in.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions: using the child's name without consent for a business, possible illegal activities (tax evasion, using business account for personal use, lack of insurance), and past betrayal by sharing private information. The author's dilemma is between loyalty to family and doing the right thing legally/ethically.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name and not following regulations, then the author might not be in the wrong for reporting her. The author's name is being misused, which could have legal repercussions for them if the business is found to be illegal. Even if the author has a complicated relationship, the law typically requires reporting crimes, especially when one's identity is being used fraudulently.\n\nHowever, there's the emotional aspect. The mom has supported the author during a tough time, albeit with her own issues. But the author's own well-being and the potential legal consequences of not reporting the mom's actions are factors. The mom's past behavior\u2014lying, betraying trust, not apologizing\u2014might justify the author's decision to report her, as the mom hasn't shown genuine remorse or responsibility.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't obligated to protect someone who's harmed them or is committing crimes. Even though the mom helped them in the past, that doesn't mean the author must ignore illegal activities. The mom's actions could lead to legal trouble for the author if the business is under their name. Reporting might be necessary to protect themselves and prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is addressing potential legal issues caused by their mother's actions, especially since the mom's conduct could have serious consequences for the author. The mom's past behavior doesn't absolve her of legal wrongdoing, and the author has a right to protect themselves and report illegal activities.\n"
