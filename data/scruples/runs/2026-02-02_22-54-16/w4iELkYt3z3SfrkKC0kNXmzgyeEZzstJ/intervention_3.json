She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The author's daughter is in 5th grade, around 10-11 years old, and she was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, got threatened with being removed, and then talked to the school resource officer who supported their frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. Teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex seems extremely age-inappropriate. Most sex education curricula in the US, especially for younger grades, focus on basics like body parts, consent, and puberty. More detailed topics usually come up in older grades, like middle or high school. So the school's program might be out of line here.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction. They walked into the principal's office and demanded an explanation. While the method was direct and perhaps confrontational, their concern is valid given the age of the children. Schools are supposed to inform parents about their curriculum and obtain consent if necessary. The principal's response of threatening to call security might be over the top. However, schools do have policies about visiting without notice, so maybe the parent didn't follow the proper procedure.\n\nThe school resource officer's reaction is interesting. He commended the parent for being peaceful despite being angry. That suggests that the officer agrees the school's actions were questionable. So there's some support for the parent's stance.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to be informed about their child's education and to express concerns. However, the method of expression matters. The parent could have written a letter first or contacted the school through proper channels. Confronting the principal in person might not be the best approach, but it doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The school's immediate threat to involve security could be a problem, as it might discourage parents from voicing concerns.\n\nIn terms of community standards, there's a lot of debate about sex education in schools. Some programs advocate for comprehensive sex education starting early, while others prefer abstinence-based or no education. The key here is whether the content aligns with the age and curriculum standards. If the school is providing information that's beyond what's appropriate for 5th grade, the parent has a right to question it.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the content seems inappropriate for the age group, the parent's right to express concerns is valid, and the school's response might have been excessive. While the parent could have approached it differently, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for raising their concerns.\n"
