She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained about their 5th grader's sex education program is in the wrong. The answer needs to be A or B based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The parent confronted the principal immediately, demanded an explanation, and was told to leave. The school mentioned topics like oral and anal sex and gave out condoms. The parent is upset, thinking it's age-inappropriate for 10-11 year olds.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is wrong. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some places do teach comprehensive sex ed earlier, but giving out condoms to 5th graders seems really young. The topics mentioned (oral/anal sex) are definitely more advanced. The parent's reaction is understandable because they might feel the content is inappropriate for that age group.\n\nBut the parent's approach was confrontational. Walking into the principal's office without notice and demanding answers could be seen as aggressive. The principal asked them to leave and threaten involving the police if necessary. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who commended their calmness, which suggests that maybe the parent's method wasn't the worst, but the initial approach was still confrontational.\n\nLegally, parents usually have the right to opt out of sex education if the school is following state guidelines, but if the content is beyond those guidelines, that's different. The parent's right to complain is valid, but the method might be where the issue is. However, the principal's response (threatening police) could be seen as overreacting. The resource officer's support of the parent's actions implies that the school's handling was problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's concern is valid regarding age-appropriate content, and while their approach might have been confrontational, they're not necessarily in the wrong. The school's response might be more at fault for providing inappropriate material and reacting harshly. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
