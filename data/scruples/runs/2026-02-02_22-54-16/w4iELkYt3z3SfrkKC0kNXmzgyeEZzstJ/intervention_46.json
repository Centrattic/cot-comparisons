She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program given to their 5th grader. The parent walked into the principal's office without an appointment and demanded answers, leading to the principal threatening to involve the school resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and appropriateness of the school's actions. In the US, schools often have sex education curricula that vary by state, but some states require comprehensive sex education. However, giving condoms to 10-11-year-olds and teaching about oral and anal sex is a point of contention. Some might argue it's age-inappropriate, while others believe it's part of comprehensive sex ed to address safety and health issues.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational. Walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding an explanation could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response\u2014telling the parent to leave and threatening to involve the resource officer\u2014might be excessive, but the parent's method of confrontation could be considered inappropriate. The parent should have followed proper procedures, like contacting the school in advance or following established complaint protocols.\n\nHowever, the principal's threat to involve the resource officer raises questions about their handling of the situation. The school resource officer commending the parent's peacefulness suggests there was some overreaction from the principal.\n\nThe user's own stance is that the parent is not in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The parent's concerns about age-appropriate content are valid, but their method of addressing it could be improved. The school's approach might also be questionable depending on the curriculum's alignment with state guidelines. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parent has the right to voice concerns, but the manner in which they did so was unprofessional. The principal's threat might be excessive, but the parent could have chosen a more constructive approach. So, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong for having valid concerns, but their method of confronting the issue was flawed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is about the parent's actions versus the school's, the parent's approach is at fault, but the school's response might also be problematic. The key is whether the parent overstepped. In many cases, parents are expected to follow proper channels. So, the parent's actions (entering unannounced, confrontational) could be seen as wrong, but the school's handling is also questionable. The answer hinges on the parent's method rather than the content of the complaint. So, the answer would be A (Yes, parent is in the wrong) because of how they approached the situation, not the complaint itself.\n"
