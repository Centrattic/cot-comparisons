She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about their child's school's sex education program. The scenario involves a 5th grader being given condoms and taught topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went directly to the principal's office, got told to leave, and the principal threatened to call the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the resource officer, who commended their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 5th grade in the US is 10-11 years old. The topics mentioned\u2014condoms, oral/anal sex\u2014seem more appropriate for older teens. The parent's reaction is understandable if they feel the content is age-inappropriate. However, schools often have curricula approved by the district or state, which might follow guidelines from health organizations. For example, the CDC or AAP might recommend comprehensive sex education starting at younger ages to address early puberty and potential exposure to information.\n\nThe parent's approach, though, was confrontational. Walking into the principal's office without notice and demanding answers might be seen as disruptive. The principal's response to ask for a letter instead of engaging immediately could be part of protocol\u2014maybe they want to document concerns properly. However, the principal threatening to involve the resource officer might be an overreaction unless there was actual aggression or violation of school policy.\n\nThe school resource officer's commendation of the parent's calmness suggests that even if the principal was upset, the parent's approach wasn't inappropriate. The key issue here is whether the content is suitable. If the school's program aligns with evidence-based guidelines, then the parent's complaint is about curriculum choice. However, as a parent, they have the right to object to certain educational content. The wrong here might lie in the delivery method\u2014had the parent followed proper channels, like contacting the school administration first or seeking a meeting, it might have been handled differently. But since the school didn't address the parent's concerns appropriately, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. Still, the direct confrontation without prior notice could be seen as a breach of protocol. So it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the specific policies of the school and the broader educational guidelines in their state.\n"
