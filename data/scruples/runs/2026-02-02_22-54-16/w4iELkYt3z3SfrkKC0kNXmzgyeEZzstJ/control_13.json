      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The question is whether they're at fault (AITA) for their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent's 5th grader (age 10-11) received condoms and learned about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office, complained, and was told to leave. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended them for being peaceful despite feeling upset.\n\nNow, determining if the parent is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, in the US, schools often have the authority to provide sex education as per state guidelines. Some states require age-appropriate sex ed, while others might leave it to school districts. However, the content being taught here seems questionable. Teaching 5th graders about anal and oral sex might be considered inappropriate by many. Also, giving out condoms to 10-year-olds is a point of contention. \n\nThe parent's approach: walking into the principal's office and demanding an explanation could be seen as confrontational. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and send a letter. The parent's method of addressing the issue was face-to-face, which might not follow the school's protocol for parent complaints. Typically, schools might prefer written communication for formal complaints. However, the parent's actions, while direct, might be justified if they feel their child is being exposed to inappropriate content.\n\nBut is the parent wrong? If the school's curriculum is following state guidelines, the parent's complaint might be about content they personally find inappropriate, which is a parental right. However, the manner in which they approached the principal\u2014storming in and demanding an answer\u2014could be seen as disruptive. The principal's threat to involve the resource officer might be a standard response to someone being in their office without an appointment.\n\nThe resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the school's reaction might have been excessive. But the parent's actions could still be considered inappropriate in terms of school protocol.\n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong if they believe the curriculum is inappropriate, but their method of addressing it could be seen as improper. However, the school's response (threatening removal) might be an overreaction. The key points are the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's method of protest. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong. The answer could hinge on whether the curriculum was indeed inappropriate. If the school is following legal guidelines, the parent's complaint is a matter of personal opinion, but the parent is within their rights to voice concerns. However, the way they did it might have been unwise. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the school's actions were justified. Since the principal demanded a letter and the parent went in person, the parent might be at fault for not following protocol. But if the content is inappropriate regardless of protocol, the parent isn't wrong. The resource officer's comment supports the parent's stance. So the answer could be B.\n"
