She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent took their daughter to the principal's office and demanded answers after finding out about condoms and topics like oral and anal sex being taught to 5th graders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade in the US is typically 10-11 years old. Teaching topics like oral and anal sex, along with distributing condoms, might be considered inappropriate for that age group. Parents often have strong opinions about sex education, especially when it comes to what's age-appropriate. \n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational\u2014going directly to the principal's office and demanding to know why these things are happening. The principal told them to leave and mentioned involving the school resource officer. However, the resource officer commended the parent for being peaceful. This adds a layer where the parent's method was direct but not violent.\n\nNow, laws and school policies vary, but generally, schools have the authority to implement educational programs that align with state or district standards. If the school follows a comprehensive sex education curriculum that includes these topics, the parent's objection might still be valid, but their method of complaint could be seen as disruptive. However, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to voice concerns. \n\nThe key points are: the appropriateness of the content for the age, the parent's right to object based on their values, and the method of complaining. While the parent's approach was abrupt, they aren't necessarily wrong if the content is indeed inappropriate. The resource officer's support suggests that the parent's concerns are legitimate, even if their method isn't the most diplomatic. So, the answer leans towards the parent not being in the wrong (B).\n"
