She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about their 5th grader's sex education program is in the wrong. The school provided condoms and taught topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11-year-olds.\n\nFirst, the parent's reaction: they went directly to the principal's office and demanded an explanation. The principal told them to leave and threatened involving the resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended them for staying calm. The user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the appropriateness of the school's actions. In the US, sex education varies by state and district. Some places have comprehensive sex ed starting in elementary school, but the content and timing are often debated. Giving condoms to 5th graders might be considered too early by many parents. Topics like oral and anal sex are more advanced and might not be suitable for that age group.\n\nThe parent's approach was direct and confrontational. While the principal didn't appreciate the visit and threatened removal, the school resource officer supported the parent's right to be upset. This suggests there might be some validity to the parent's concerns. However, the method of confronting the principal in person could be seen as aggressive. A more appropriate approach might have been to contact the school through proper channels first, like the office or via a letter, as the principal suggested. \n\nBut the parent did follow up by asking to speak with the resource officer, which shows they tried to resolve the issue peacefully. The resource officer's response indicates that the parent's concerns are shared by others, which might support their stance.\n\nIn terms of legality, schools must follow state laws regarding sex education. If the curriculum is in compliance with those laws, the parent might not have grounds for complaint. However, if the program exceeds state guidelines, the parent has a right to object. The key is whether the content is age-appropriate and aligns with the school's policies.\n\nThe parent's actions were confrontational but not violent. The school's response\u2014threatening removal\u2014might have been an overreaction, especially since the resource officer supported the parent's right to be concerned. So while the parent could have handled it differently, the core issue of inappropriate content might not be their fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong, especially if the school's program is indeed inappropriate. However, their method of addressing the issue could have been more constructive. Given the options, the answer would lean towards the parent not being in the wrong.\n"
