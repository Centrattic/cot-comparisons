She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The situation is that a parent walked into the principal's office and was very upset about condoms and teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex. The principal told them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. The user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 5th graders in the US are typically 10-11 years old. Teaching them about advanced sexual topics and giving out condoms at that age seems questionable. There's a debate about age-appropriate sex education. Some programs do include comprehensive sex ed, but the content and delivery matter. If the program is giving out condoms and discussing topics like oral and anal sex, that might be beyond what's appropriate for elementary school.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction: walking into the principal's office and demanding to know why. That's a direct approach, but maybe not the most constructive. However, the parent wasn't violent or aggressive, just upset. The principal's response was to threaten removal, which might be an overreaction. The school resource officer commended the parent's peacefulness, suggesting that while the parent was right to be upset, their method was calm.\n\nLegally, schools can have sex ed programs, but parents usually have the right to opt their children out. So the parent's right to complain is valid. However, the method of confronting the principal in person might be seen as confrontational. The correct procedure might be to follow the school's protocol for concerns, like sending a letter or meeting through proper channels. The parent didn't do that initially, which could be seen as inappropriate, even if the concern is valid.\n\nThe key points are: Is the content age-appropriate? The parent's approach to addressing it. The school's response. The parent's right to object vs. the method of objection.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the parent's concern is valid if the program is inappropriate. But storming the principal's office without following procedures might be seen as wrong. However, the parent did ask to speak with the resource officer, which shows they were trying to resolve it peacefully. The resource officer's support suggests the parent's approach wasn't entirely wrong.\n\nSo, the parent is justified in their concern about the content but may have approached it in a way that's not the standard protocol. However, since they were calm and tried to engage, maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, the school's approach to sex ed might be questionable. The answer hinges on both the content and the method of the parent's complaint.\n"
