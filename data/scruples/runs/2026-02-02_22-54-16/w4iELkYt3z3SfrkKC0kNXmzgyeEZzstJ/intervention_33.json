She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent went to the principal's office without prior notice, demanded an explanation, and was told to leave. The principal even mentioned involving the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the resource officer, who seemed to agree with their frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. The school is teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex and giving out condoms. That's age 10-11, which is really young. In many places, comprehensive sex education can start earlier, but giving condoms to that age group might be controversial. Some might argue that it's providing necessary information and resources, while others believe it's too advanced for that age.\n\nNext, the parent's actions: walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding to know why such topics are being taught. The parent might have overstepped by not following proper protocol, like sending a letter or requesting a meeting first. However, the parent's concern is about their child's education and safety, which is a valid reason. The school's response of threatening to involve the resource officer might be excessive, especially since the resource officer commended the parent's composure.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations vary by location. In some states, parents have the right to opt their children out of sex education. The school might have policies in place that allow for such opt-outs, which the parent might not have been aware of. If the school didn't provide prior notice about the curriculum changes, that's a problem. \n\nThe parent's intention was to express concern over age-inappropriate content, which is a legitimate issue. However, the method of confrontation\u2014storming the office without prior arrangement\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The school might prefer parents to use formal channels first.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a divide between comprehensive sex education supporters and those who prefer abstinence-based or no education. The parent's reaction might be based on personal beliefs, but the school's approach is likely based on educational standards or health guidelines. The key here is whether the school followed proper procedures and provided opt-out options.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's core concern is valid, but the method of addressing it might not be the best approach. However, the school's response was aggressive, which could indicate a problem. The resource officer's support suggests the parent's concerns might have merit. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for voicing their concerns, but perhaps the manner was inappropriate. But since the main issue is the content being taught, which is questionable, the parent's actions, while maybe not the best in terms of protocol, are driven by valid concerns. Therefore, the answer is B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
