She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The key points here are the age of the child (5th grade, so around 10-11 years old), the content of the program (teaching about condoms, oral and anal sex), and the parent's reaction (confronting the principal directly and then the principal's response).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the US, sex education policies can vary by state and district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, which might include topics like consent, anatomy, and contraception. However, the mention of giving out condoms and discussing more advanced topics like oral and anal sex at such a young age raises concerns. Even if the curriculum is age-appropriate according to some guidelines, the parent's perspective is that it's inappropriate for 5th graders.\n\nNext, the parent's actions. They went directly to the principal's office without prior notice, which might be seen as confrontational. However, the principal's response was to have them leave and threatened involving the resource officer. The school resource officer's comment to the parent suggests that the parent's approach was somewhat measured compared to the officer's hypothetical reaction, indicating that the school's response might have been overly harsh.\n\nThe parent's main issue is the content of the program, not the method of delivery. They are acting out of concern for their child's well-being and appropriateness of the material. While their method might not have been the most diplomatic, the right to question school curriculum is a parent's right. However, escalating the situation in person without prior communication (like sending an email or meeting with the principal first) could be seen as contributing to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the school's response\u2014threatening to involve law enforcement\u2014seems excessive if the parent is merely expressing a legitimate concern. The principal's insistence on written communication might be a standard procedure for formal complaints, but the immediate threat of removal is problematic.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents usually have the right to be informed about and involved in their child's education. However, there are limits. If the school is following state guidelines, the parent might have a different opinion but isn't necessarily in the wrong for objecting. However, the manner in which they approached the principal might be questioned in terms of appropriateness. But given the principal's aggressive response, the parent's actions might be seen as justified in defending their child's education.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's primary issue is the content they find inappropriate, not the method of complaint. While their approach could have been more constructive, the core of their complaint is about the school's curriculum. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. The school's reaction, however, might be more problematic. So the answer is B (No).\n"
