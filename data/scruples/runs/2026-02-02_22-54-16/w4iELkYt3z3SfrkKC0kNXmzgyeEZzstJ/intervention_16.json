She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office, demanded answers about condoms and advanced topics, and the principal told them to leave. The school resource officer commended the parent's calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. In the US, there's a lot of debate about when to start sex ed. Some schools teach comprehensive sex ed starting at younger ages, including topics like consent and puberty, but giving out condoms to 10-11 year olds might be a red flag. Oral and anal sex are definitely more advanced topics for that age group.\n\nThen there's the parent's reaction. Confronting the principal in person could be seen as aggressive, but the principal's response seems a bit over the top by threatening the resource officer. The resource officer's comment supports the parent's stance, suggesting the principal might not be handling it well.\n\nLegally, parents usually have the right to know what their children are being taught and to opt out of certain programs, depending on the school's policies. The parent's action of voicing concerns is within their rights. However, the method (storming into the office) might not be the best approach, but it doesn't make them wrong if they're advocating for their child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent isn't in the wrong. The school's response seems harsh, and the content of the program raises valid concerns. The answer should be B.\n"
