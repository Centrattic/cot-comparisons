She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent found out their 5th-grade daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office and demanded answers, leading to a confrontation. The principal told them to leave and mention sending a letter instead. The school resource officer supported the parent's frustration.\n\nNow, the key points here are: What is appropriate sex education for 5th graders? In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, while others leave it to local schools. The parent is upset because they believe the content is age-inappropriate. \n\nThe parent's actions: confronting the principal in person, which might be seen as confrontational. The principal's response was to tell them to leave and suggest formal communication. However, the resource officer commended the parent for being peaceful, indicating that perhaps the principal's reaction was overly harsh.\n\nLegally, parents usually have the right to complain about school activities, even if they disagree. The school's response of threatening to call the resource officer seems excessive. The parent is within their rights to express concerns, especially about what they perceive as inappropriate material for their child's age.\n\nHowever, the method of confrontation might be questionable. Walking into the principal's office without an appointment and demanding could be seen as disruptive. The appropriate step might have been to contact the school through proper channels first, like sending a letter or requesting a meeting. But the parent's concern is valid if the school is providing content that's not age-appropriate or against the parent's values.\n\nIn terms of the content itself, the teaching of condoms and advanced topics at age 10-11 is controversial. Some experts argue that comprehensive sex education should be age-appropriate and include necessary information, but others disagree. The parent is acting on their belief that the school overstepped.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might not be in the wrong for expressing their concerns, especially if they believe the program is inappropriate. The school's response seems disproportionate. However, the manner of confrontation could have been handled better. But since the resource officer supported the parent's frustration, it suggests the school might have overreacted. So the answer is likely that the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
