She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office without an appointment, demanded answers, and was told to leave, but the school resource officer commended them for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parent is upset that their 5th grader was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. In the US, there's a lot of debate about sex education in schools. Some states require comprehensive sex education, while others don't. The age here is 10-11 years old, which is young for such topics. \n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational. They went directly to the principal's office without scheduling a meeting, which might be seen as inappropriate. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, like written complaints or meetings with the principal. The parent's method could be seen as disruptive, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nHowever, the principal's reaction\u2014threatening to call the school resource officer\u2014might be excessive. The resource officer's response suggests that the parent's actions were not entirely unreasonable. There's a line between addressing concerns properly and being confrontational. The parent might have been justified in their concerns but chose an aggressive method. \n\nOn the other hand, the school's curriculum might be following legal guidelines or district policies. If the school is providing age-appropriate education as required, the parent's complaint could be a matter of personal opinion versus educational standards. But if the content is indeed inappropriate for the age group, the parent has a valid point. \n\nSo, the parent's actions might not be in the wrong in terms of their concerns, but the manner in which they approached the principal could be seen as the problem. They should have followed proper channels. However, the resource officer's support complicates this. The answer might depend on whether the curriculum was appropriate and the correct procedure for parent complaints. If the parent's approach was too aggressive but the curriculum was inappropriate, it's a gray area. But if the curriculum is within guidelines, then the parent is in the wrong for not following proper procedures.\n"
