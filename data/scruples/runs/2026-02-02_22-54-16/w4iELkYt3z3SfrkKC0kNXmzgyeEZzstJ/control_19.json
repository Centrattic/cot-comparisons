She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent went to the principal's office and got told to leave, but the school resource officer commended them for staying calm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children\u20145th grade in the U.S. is around 10-11 years old. The parent is upset because their daughter brought home a condom and was taught about oral and anal sex, which the parent considers age-inappropriate. The principal responded aggressively, threatening to involve the school resource officer. The SRO, however, supported the parent's actions, saying he would have done the same.\n\nNow, the key points here are the appropriateness of the curriculum. In the U.S., sex education standards vary by state and district. Some areas include comprehensive sex education starting at a young age, while others are more abstinence-focused or have opt-out policies. The parent's reaction is based on their belief that the content is unsuitable for 5th graders. \n\nThe parent's actions included confronting the principal directly but in a non-confrontational way. The principal's response was to threaten removal, which might indicate a lack of openness to parental concerns. The SRO's support suggests that the parent's approach was reasonable. \n\nHowever, the parent could have been more proactive by first reviewing the school's curriculum or contacting the principal in advance, perhaps via email or a letter, as the principal suggested. But given the SRO's reaction and the nature of the content (condoms and advanced topics), the parent's concern might be justified. \n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, the issue is whether the content is age-appropriate. If the school's curriculum includes such topics for 5th graders, the parent has a right to express concern. However, the parent's method of confrontation\u2014storming into the principal's office\u2014might be seen as abrupt, even if they meant no harm. But the SRO's approval implies that the parent's approach wasn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their concern, especially if they believe the content is inappropriate. The school's response, however, could be problematic. The answer would likely be B (No) because the parent's concern is valid if the curriculum is indeed age-inappropriate, and they have the right to voice their objections. The principal's reaction might be excessive, but the parent isn't wrong for raising the issue.\n"
