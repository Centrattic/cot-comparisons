She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who's upset because their 5th grade daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went to the principal's office, demanded an explanation, and the principal asked them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. But then the officer said he would have made a scene too and commended the parent for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade is around 10-11 years old. The parent is shocked that they're giving out condoms and teaching advanced topics. Is that age-appropriate? I know some schools do sex education, but the content might vary. In the US, there's a range of approaches. Some states have comprehensive sex education that includes topics like consent, anatomy, and contraception, while others might be more abstinence-focused. But distributing condoms to 5th graders seems odd. At that age, kids might not be ready for such information, especially more advanced topics like oral or anal sex. Those are typically covered in higher grades, maybe middle or high school, if at all.\n\nThe parent's reaction is to go straight to the principal and demand answers. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and threaten the resource officer. However, the resource officer (who is probably a police officer or similar) agreed that the parent's reaction was understandable. The officer even commended the parent for being calm. That suggests that maybe the principal overreacted.\n\nNow, whether the parent is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B). The parent's action was confrontational, but the content being taught might be inappropriate. The parent has a right to be concerned about their child's education and to question the curriculum. The principal's response seems harsh, especially when the resource officer supported the parent's frustration. The parent didn't cause harm; they wanted to address a potential issue. So even if the parent's approach was abrupt, the principal's threat might be a bigger issue. The parent isn't necessarily wrong for voicing their concerns, especially if the school is violating their expectations or policies. However, if the school's program is in line with legal or district guidelines, the parent might still have a right to be upset but perhaps isn't in the wrong for objecting. The key here is whether the content was indeed inappropriate. If it's against the school's policies or standard age-appropriate guidelines, the parent is justified. If it's within those guidelines, the parent's reaction might be unwarranted. But given the officer's support, it's possible the school's approach was questionable. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
