She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded to know why their 5th grader was given condoms and taught advanced topics like oral and anal sex. The principal sent them away and threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended them for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational guidelines. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, which may include topics like puberty, consent, and contraception. However, the appropriateness of content for 5th graders (10-11 years old) is debatable. Teaching about oral and anal sex seems advanced for that age group, even in some curriculums.\n\nNext, the parent's actions: confronting the principal in person might be seen as aggressive or not following proper channels. Typically, parents are advised to first contact the school in writing or through the proper procedures. However, the parent did escalate to the school resource officer, and even that officer commended their composure. That suggests that while the approach was direct, it wasn't necessarily inappropriate.\n\nThe principal's response\u2014threatening to involve the officer\u2014might be overreacting. Parents have the right to voice concerns about their child's education, and the principal's threat could be seen as dismissing valid parental input. The parent's demand for an explanation is within their rights as a guardian.\n\nHowever, there's a line between expressing concern and being confrontational. Walking into the principal's office unannounced and demanding answers could be considered unprofessional. Yet, the principal's reaction was harsh. The key here is balancing the parent's right to object with the school's duty to provide education as per their policies.\n\nIn terms of the content itself, if the school's curriculum includes age-inappropriate topics, the parent has a legitimate reason to object. But the method of objection (direct confrontation without prior communication) might not be the best approach. However, the parent's actions were not violent or threatening, and the school's response seems excessive.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't in the wrong for voicing concerns about what they perceive as inappropriate content. The school's threat to remove them is problematic, and the parent's right to express dissent is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
