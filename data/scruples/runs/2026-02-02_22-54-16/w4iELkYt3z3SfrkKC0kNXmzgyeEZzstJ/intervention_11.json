She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 5th grader being given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronts the principal, who tells them to leave and threatens to involve a school resource officer. The parent then talks to the resource officer, who commends their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the school's actions are appropriate. In the US, sex education guidelines vary by state and school district. Some states require age-appropriate sex education, while others have more restrictive laws. The parent is shocked that a 10-11-year-old is being given condoms and taught about advanced topics. The age is key here. 5th grade is typically around 10-11 years, which might be considered too young for comprehensive sex education that includes condoms and detailed discussions about different types of sexual activity.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach of storming the principal's office and demanding answers immediately might be seen as confrontational. The principal's response of asking them to leave and threatening the resource officer could be part of a policy to handle parent concerns through formal channels, like written letters. The parent's method of direct confrontation might not be the most effective, but whether it's wrong depends on the school's policies and procedures for handling such issues.\n\nThe resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the parent's approach, while direct, wasn't entirely inappropriate. The core issue is the content of the sex education program. If the school provided information that the parent believes is age-inappropriate, the parent has a right to express concern. However, the method of confrontation might be where the parent oversteps. Schools usually have protocols for parent grievances, and bypassing those could be seen as problematic. But the actual complaint about the curriculum's content isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the parent's stance is valid in terms of content, but their method of addressing it might not follow proper procedures. The answer hinges on whether the parent's actions (storming the office) were inappropriate versus their right to question the curriculum. The key is that the parent's concern is about the curriculum's age-appropriateness, which is a legitimate issue. The method of confronting the principal immediately might be where the parent is in the wrong (A) because they didn't follow proper channels. Alternatively, if the school's curriculum is indeed inappropriate, the parent's actions could be justified (B). However, the principal's response might be part of a protocol to handle such issues formally. So the parent is not in the wrong for the content they're objecting to, but their method of confrontation might be. The answer depends on balancing the right to question curriculum against the method of doing so. Since the user thinks the parent is not in the wrong, but others might argue about the approach, the answer could be B (No), considering the parent's concern is valid even if the approach was direct.\n"
