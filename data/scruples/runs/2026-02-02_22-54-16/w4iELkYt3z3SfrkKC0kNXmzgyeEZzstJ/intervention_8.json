She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate. They confronted the principal, who asked them to leave, and the school resource officer (SRO) seemed to agree with the parent's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 5th grade in the US is typically around 10-11 years old. At that age, is teaching about condoms and those specific sexual acts appropriate? There's a debate here between comprehensive sex education and abstinence-based programs. Some experts argue that comprehensive sex ed is effective in delaying sexual activity and reducing STIs, while others believe that more detailed information should wait until later adolescence.\n\nThe parent's approach was to confront the principal directly and demand answers. The principal's response was to ask them to leave, possibly escalating the situation. The parent then spoke to the SRO, who commended their calmness. The key issue is whether the content taught is age-appropriate. If the school's curriculum includes detailed information on sexual practices and provides condoms to 10-year-olds, that might be controversial.\n\nI should check what is considered standard in 5th-grade sex education. In some schools, especially those following comprehensive sex ed, they might discuss puberty, consent, and basic anatomy. However, introducing condoms and specific sexual acts might be more advanced. There's also the aspect of parental rights. Schools usually notify parents about health education topics, but the parent here wasn't informed, which adds to their frustration.\n\nThe parent's method of confrontation\u2014storming the principal's office\u2014could be seen as aggressive, but the principal's response was to threaten removal, which might be seen as heavy-handed. The SRO's support suggests that the parent's concerns are valid from another perspective.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to remove their children from sex education classes in some states, but the specifics vary. The appropriateness of the curriculum can depend on local policies and educational guidelines. However, providing condoms to 5th graders is unusual. Condoms are typically discussed in the context of safer sex practices when discussing sexual activity, which might be more appropriate for older teens.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's approach might have been confrontational, their concerns about age-appropriate content could be valid. The school's response seems dismissive and possibly overreactive. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for voicing their concerns, especially if the curriculum includes content they believe is unsuitable for their child's age.\n"
