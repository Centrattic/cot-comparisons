She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who went to the principal's office after their 5th-grade daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex. The parent is upset and wants to know if they're in the wrong for complaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth grade in the US is around 10-11 years old. At that age, teaching about advanced sexual topics and giving out condoms seems really inappropriate. Most parents would probably be shocked. The parent is reacting to what they perceive as inappropriate content in the curriculum.\n\nThe parent confronted the principal directly, which might be seen as aggressive. The principal asked them to leave and mentioned involving the school resource officer. But then the resource officer supported the parent's reaction, saying he would have done the same. That's interesting because it suggests that even someone in authority might agree the education is too advanced.\n\nHowever, the parent's approach of walking into the principal's office without notice and demanding answers could be seen as confrontational. The principal suggested sending a letter instead, which is a more formal process. Maybe the parent should have followed proper channels first, like speaking with the teacher or contacting the principal in a more structured way.\n\nBut the content itself is a bigger issue. If the school is teaching 10-year-olds about anal and oral sex and providing condoms, that's likely beyond standard sex education for that age. In many places, sex education is age-appropriate and starts with basic anatomy and consent, not more advanced topics. The parent's concern is valid, but their method might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for being concerned, but their method of confrontation could have been handled better. However, the school's response might also be excessive if the content was indeed inappropriate. Since the resource officer commended the parent, it shows there's some support for their stance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's approach might not have been the most diplomatic, their concern is valid given the age of the children. The school might be overreacting, and the content itself is questionable. Therefore, the parent is probably not in the wrong.\n"
