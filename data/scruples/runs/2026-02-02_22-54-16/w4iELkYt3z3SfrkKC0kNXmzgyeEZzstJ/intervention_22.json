She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent who complained about the 5th grade sex education program is in the wrong. The key points here are the content of the program, the parent's reaction, and the school's response.\n\nFirst, the parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught topics like oral and anal sex in 5th grade, which is around 10-11 years old. That seems very young for such topics. In many places, sex education is age-appropriate, usually starting with basic anatomy and consent in younger grades, and more detailed information in high school. So the content might be inappropriate for that age group.\n\nThe parent confronted the principal directly, which might be seen as abrupt, but they did ask to speak to the school resource officer when threatened. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and mention involving security, which could be an overreaction. The school resource officer commended the parent for being peaceful, suggesting the parent's approach wasn't unreasonable.\n\nLegally, schools often have policies on sex education, which might require parental opt-out options. If the parent wasn't informed beforehand, that's a problem. However, the parent's immediate confrontation without prior communication (like sending a letter as the principal suggested) might not be the best approach, but the principal's threat to involve security is concerning.\n\nSo, the parent's issue is about the content being inappropriate, which is valid. Their method of addressing it might not have been the best, but the school's hostile response is also an issue. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but perhaps should have followed proper channels first. However, the school's excessive reaction might exonerate the parent.\n"
