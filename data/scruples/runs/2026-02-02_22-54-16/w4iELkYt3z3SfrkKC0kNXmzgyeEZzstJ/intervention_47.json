She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program at their child's school. The parent went to the principal's office in person and was told to leave, then the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the officer, who seemed to support them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, parents have rights to their child's education, including curriculum content. Some states require schools to notify parents about sex education programs, and others allow parents to opt their children out. If the school didn't follow proper procedures, like getting consent or providing opt-out options, the parent might have a valid complaint.\n\nNext, the appropriateness of the content. Teaching 5th graders about oral and anal sex and giving out condoms could be seen as age-inappropriate. However, some educational standards include comprehensive sex education that starts earlier, aiming to provide accurate information. The parent's shock might be valid if the content is beyond what they consider suitable for that age group.\n\nThe parent's method of addressing the issue\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers\u2014might be considered confrontational. While the parent is upset, entering the office without an appointment and insisting immediately could be seen as disruptive. However, the principal's response, threatening to call the resource officer, seems excessive if the parent was just voicing concerns.\n\nThe school resource officer's reaction is interesting. He commended the parent for being peaceful, which suggests that while the situation was tense, the parent's approach wasn't unreasonable. The principal's refusal to engage directly might indicate a failure to address parental concerns appropriately.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parent's actions are within their rights to voice concerns about their child's education. The school's response, especially the threat of legal involvement, might be seen as overreaching. However, the parent's method could have been more constructive, like following proper channels first (e.g., contacting the teacher, sending a letter, or meeting with the principal at a scheduled time). But given the circumstances, the parent is not in the wrong for expressing their concerns.\n"
