      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining to the school about their sex ed program. The parent found out their 5th grader was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical approach to sex education in schools. In the US, comprehensive sex education is common in some states, aiming to provide age-appropriate information. However, there's a lot of variation. The parent is upset because they believe the content is too advanced for 10-11 year olds. \n\nThe parent's reaction: they went directly to the principal, demanded an explanation, and were told to send a letter instead. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer, but the officer supported the parent's actions. \n\nNow, the key points are whether the school's curriculum is appropriate and if the parent's approach was reasonable. Legally, schools usually have the right to their curriculum unless it's illegal. However, parents have the right to opt out if they object. The parent's method of confronting the principal in person was perhaps abrupt, but the content of their complaint is about their child's education. \n\nThe school's response (threatening removal) might be excessive. The principal's handling of the situation could be problematic. The parent's actions, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, are about advocating for their child. The SRO's support suggests the parent had a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for voicing concerns. However, the manner of confrontation (storming into the office) might not be the best approach. But the core issue is about the content being taught. Since the parent is acting within their rights to challenge the school's program, they're likely not in the wrong. The school's reaction seems harsh, which might indicate their approach is questionable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
