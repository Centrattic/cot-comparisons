She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is a parent whose 5th-grade daughter received condoms and was taught about oral and anal sex as part of a sex education program at school. The parent went to the principal's office immediately, demanded explanations, and was told to leave and send a letter instead. The principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer. But then the resource officer commended the parent for handling it peacefully. The parent is asking if it's acceptable to be upset about this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the children. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old. The topics mentioned\u2014condoms, oral and anal sex\u2014are typically part of more advanced sex education. Some might argue that comprehensive sex education includes these topics, but others may find them inappropriate for such a young age. The parent's reaction is based on the belief that these topics are age-inappropriate.\n\nNext, the parent's actions. They walked into the principal's office and demanded answers. This could be seen as confrontational, especially without prior communication. However, the parent's concern is genuine and based on their child's well-being. The principal's response was to demand they leave and threaten with a letter, which might be seen as dismissive or overreacting. The school resource officer's support of the parent's approach suggests that the parent's actions, while direct, weren't entirely unreasonable.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents usually have the right to be involved in their child's education and to raise concerns. However, the method of communication matters. Approaching the principal in person without an appointment might not be the most effective way, but it's not necessarily wrong. Schools often have procedures for such concerns, like sending a letter or scheduling a meeting. The parent's immediate reaction might not follow protocol, but their intent is to address what they see as a problem.\n\nCultural and societal norms also play a role. In some areas, comprehensive sex education is standard, while in others, it's controversial. The parent's reaction might reflect their personal or cultural beliefs about what's appropriate for children. The resource officer's understanding implies that even within the school, there might be differing opinions on the appropriateness of the program.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's concern about age-appropriate content might be valid, so they're not in the wrong for raising it. However, the manner in which they did it\u2014storming into the principal's office\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. But since the resource officer supported their approach, maybe the school's response was too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parent's concern is valid regarding the appropriateness of the content for 5th graders, and while the method could be improved, the parent isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns, especially since another staff member acknowledged their peaceful handling.\n"
