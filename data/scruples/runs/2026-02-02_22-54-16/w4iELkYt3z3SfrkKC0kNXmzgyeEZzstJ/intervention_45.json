She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for complaining about the 5th grade sex ed program. The situation is that the child got condoms and was taught about oral and anal sex, which the parent finds inappropriate for 10-11-year-olds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. Parents have the right to be involved in their child's education and to express concerns about what's being taught. But the parent went into the principal's office without prior notice and demanded answers, which might be seen as confrontational. The principal asked them to leave and suggested sending a letter instead, which is a standard procedure. The parent then asked to talk to the school resource officer, who commended their calmness.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was in the wrong. On one hand, the parent is reacting to content they find inappropriate. On the other hand, the way they approached the school might have been too abrupt. Schools usually have protocols for handling complaints, like written communication first. However, the parent did attempt to address the issue, and the officer supported their approach. It's a bit of a gray area. In some cases, immediate confrontation without following the proper channels might be seen as inappropriate. But the parent's concern is valid, and the school's response might also be overly harsh. So, depending on the specific school policies and local laws regarding sex education, the parent might have a legitimate grievance. The answer here depends on whether the parent should have followed the school's procedures first. If the school requires written complaints, then the parent might be at fault for not following that. But if the parent's intent was to address a potentially harmful situation, their actions could be justified. However, since the parent approached the principal in person and caused some disruption, maybe there's a case for saying they were in the wrong in terms of method. But the content of the complaint is about appropriate education for the child's age, which is a valid concern. This is tricky. The user believes the parent isn't wrong, but there's a balance between valid concerns and proper procedure. I think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the parent's concern is about their child's education and safety, and while the method might be debatable, the intent is legitimate. The school's response was to threaten removal, which might be an overreaction. The officer's support suggests the parent's actions were reasonable. So, B.\n"
