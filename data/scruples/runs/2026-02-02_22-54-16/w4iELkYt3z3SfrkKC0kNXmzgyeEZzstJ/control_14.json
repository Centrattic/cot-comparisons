She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the parent did. They went to the principal's office, demanded an explanation, and got told to leave, with a threat of being removed by the school resource officer. The parent says the school gave condoms and taught topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11 year olds.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the children and the content of the sex education program. In the US, sex education policies can vary by state and school district. Some schools do comprehensive sex education, which might include topics like consent, anatomy, and contraception, but whether they're age-appropriate is a common debate.\n\nNow, the parent's actions: they confronted the principal in person, demanded answers, and were told to leave. The principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then talked to the SRO, who seemed to agree that they'd be upset too. \n\nBut the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's complaint is based on the belief that the content is age-inappropriate. However, schools often follow curriculum guidelines set by local education authorities. If the program aligns with those guidelines, the parent might be overstepping by confronting the principal in that manner. Even if the parent disagrees, the proper channel usually involves contacting the school administration through appropriate means, like a formal letter or a meeting, not an in-person confrontation.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern about age-inappropriate content is valid. There's a debate over what's appropriate for elementary school students. The fact that the SRO commended the parent's peaceful approach suggests that while the content might be controversial, the parent's immediate action might not have been the best approach. But whether they are in the wrong depends on both the content and their actions.\n\nIn some cases, schools do provide comprehensive sex education starting in elementary school, which can include topics like body parts, consent, and basic sexual health. Condoms might be part of a lesson on anatomy or protection, but giving out condoms to 5th graders is unusual and potentially inappropriate. However, the parent's method of addressing this\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers\u2014could be seen as confrontational and not in line with proper channels. \n\nSo the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their concern is valid. But if the school's program is indeed providing inappropriate content, then the parent has a legitimate reason to be upset. The answer hinges on both the content appropriateness and the parent's approach. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the parent's actions were reasonable given the content. If the content is inappropriate, the parent isn't in the wrong, but if the content is appropriate and the parent's approach was overly aggressive, then they might be. However, in many cases, the content provided to 5th graders might not include advanced topics like oral/anal sex or distribution of condoms, making the parent's concern valid. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong.\n"
