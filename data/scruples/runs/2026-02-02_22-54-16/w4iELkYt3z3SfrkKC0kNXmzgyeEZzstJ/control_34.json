      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about a parent who complained to the school about the sex education program in their 5th grader's class. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate. They went to the principal's office, got told to leave, and then spoke with the school resource officer who actually commended them for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational standards. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states require age-appropriate sex education, while others don't. The parent's concern is that the content is too advanced for 10-11-year-olds. Maybe the school followed a curriculum that's considered appropriate by educational guidelines. For example, some programs might introduce basic concepts of human anatomy and puberty in elementary school, but teaching about specific sexual acts or providing condoms might be more advanced than what's typically covered at that age.\n\nThen there's the parent's reaction. They went to the principal's office in person and demanded answers. The principal asked them to leave and suggested sending a letter instead. The parent then spoke to the resource officer, who supported their frustration. The parent's actions might be seen as confrontational, but the resource officer didn't see it as a problem. However, the parent's method of approaching the issue (storming the principal's office) might not be the most constructive way, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nLegally, parents have rights regarding their child's education, including opting out of certain classes. If the school provided materials that the parent found inappropriate, they might have a right to object. However, the appropriateness of the content is subjective. Some might argue that comprehensive sex education should include information on all aspects of sexual health, while others believe it's too much for young children.\n\nThe school's response\u2014telling the parent to send a letter and threatening to involve the resource officer\u2014might be a standard protocol to handle parent complaints formally. However, the principal's immediate reaction to ask the parent to leave could be seen as dismissive, especially if the parent's concerns are legitimate.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms in the US, there's a divide between those who advocate for comprehensive sex education starting early and those who prefer abstinence-only or less detailed approaches. The parent is on the side of the latter, finding the content inappropriate. The school may be following a curriculum that aligns with the former approach, believing it's important for children to have accurate information.\n\nConsidering all this, whether the parent is in the wrong depends on the school's policies and local regulations. If the school's program exceeds what's mandated or is not age-appropriate under local standards, the parent's complaint is justified. However, if the school's program is in line with state guidelines, the parent might be overstepping. The parent's method of confrontation might be seen as inconsiderate, but their underlying concern could be valid. The resource officer's support suggests that others see the parent's perspective as reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the school's actions were appropriate according to their policies and the parent's right to object. If the school was indeed providing age-inappropriate content, the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the school followed proper guidelines, the parent might be. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the resource officer's support, it's more likely that the parent isn't in the wrong. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
