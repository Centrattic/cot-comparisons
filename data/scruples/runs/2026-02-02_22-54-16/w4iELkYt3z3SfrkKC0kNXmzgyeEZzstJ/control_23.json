She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the sex education program at their child's school. The parent says their 5th grader was given a condom and taught about oral and anal sex. The school's response was to tell them to leave and mention involving the resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders in the US are typically 10-11 years old. At that age, some might argue that comprehensive sex education is appropriate, especially in addressing topics like consent, puberty, and basic health. However, the inclusion of specific methods like condoms and more advanced topics might be seen as too explicit for that age group by some parents.\n\nNext, the parent's approach. They went directly to the principal, demanded an explanation, and were told to leave. While the parent is expressing a valid concern, the manner in which they approached it might be seen as confrontational. The school's response could be due to protocol for handling parent complaints, which might prefer written communication. However, the threat of involving the resource officer might be a heavy-handed reaction.\n\nThe school resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the parent's actions were within bounds in terms of expressing concern. However, the appropriateness of the content is a separate issue. There's a legal aspect too\u2014schools in the US often have the authority to provide sex education as per state guidelines, which can vary. If the program aligns with state standards, the parent might have a hard time getting the school to change their approach.\n\nThe parent's right to complain is protected, but the method of confrontation could be problematic. Schools usually have procedures for addressing parent concerns, and skipping those steps might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is whether the content is age-appropriate. If the curriculum is indeed inappropriate, the parent is justified in voicing their concern. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for being concerned about the content. However, their approach could be improved by following the proper channels (like sending a letter as the principal suggested) instead of confronting the principal in person. The school's response might also be excessive. So, the parent isn't at fault for their concern but could be advised on better ways to address it.\n"
