She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The parent found out their 5th grader was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex, which they considered age-inappropriate. They confronted the principal, who told them to leave and threatened involving the school resource officer. The officer then praised the parent for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's curriculum. In the US, sex education policies vary by state. Some states require comprehensive sex education, which includes information on consent, STIs, and contraception. However, teaching about specific sexual acts like oral and anal sex to 10-11-year-olds might be controversial. Parents have rights to object if they feel the content is inappropriate, so the parent's complaint isn't inherently wrong.\n\nNext, the parent's approach: walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. While it's understandable to be upset, the method of confrontation might be seen as aggressive. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and send a letter, which is a procedural response to maintain order. However, the parent's actions, while direct, might be within their rights as a concerned parent.\n\nThen there's the school resource officer's comment. He commended the parent for being peaceful, which suggests that while their actions were strong, they weren't violent. The principal's threat to involve law enforcement could be problematic, as it might discourage parents from voicing concerns.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to object to school content they find inappropriate, but the manner in which they do so matters. The parent might not be in the wrong for raising the issue, but their approach could be seen as disruptive. However, the school's response was also heavy-handed.\n\nIn terms of child safety and education, providing condoms to 5th graders is unusual. Typically, sex education at that age focuses on puberty, body changes, and basic consent. Including contraception might be part of a comprehensive program, but the age appropriateness is debatable. The parent has valid concerns here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's complaint is justified due to the content's age-inappropriateness. However, their method of confrontation could be improved. The school's response was overly threatening. So, the parent isn't in the wrong for expressing concerns, but maybe the approach could have been more formal. The key is that they have a right to object, so the answer should be B (No).\n"
