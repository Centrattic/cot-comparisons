She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The parent found out that their 5th grader (10-11 years old) received a condom and was taught about oral and anal sex, which seems age-inappropriate. They confronted the principal, who asked them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. The officer then commended the parent for their calmness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. In the US, 5th grade is typically around 10-11 years old. Most sex education curricula in that age range focus on basic topics like body parts, puberty, consent, and maybe some basics of reproduction. Teaching about oral and anal sex and giving out condoms seems more advanced. However, some schools might include condom distribution as part of a comprehensive sex ed program, but the age could be an issue here.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction. They walked into the principal's office and demanded an explanation. That might be seen as confrontational. But the principal's response was to tell them to leave and threaten removal, which seems heavy-handed. The school resource officer's comment that he would have been angry and commended the parent's calmness suggests that the principal's reaction was excessive. \n\nLegal and policy aspects: Parents have the right to know about and object to certain educational content, especially regarding health and sex education. However, the method of confronting the principal in person without prior notice might not be the most appropriate. The parent might have a valid concern, but the way they addressed it could be problematic. The principal's threat might be a breach of protocol if they were supposed to handle such concerns more diplomatically.\n\nSo, the parent might be justified in their concern about the content being age-inappropriate, but their approach could be considered too abrupt. The principal's reaction might be considered over the top, though. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. They have the right to complain, but maybe the method wasn't the best. However, the principal's immediate threat and removal might also be wrong. The answer likely depends on the school's policies and whether the content was indeed appropriate. Since the user is asking for a judgment, and the principal's response was harsh, the parent's action isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it better. The key points are the appropriateness of the content for 5th graders and the parent's right to express concerns. Given the information, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if the content is actually appropriate. If the school was providing comprehensive sex ed beyond the parent's comfort, the parent is within their rights to object. The principal's reaction was unprofessional, so the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
