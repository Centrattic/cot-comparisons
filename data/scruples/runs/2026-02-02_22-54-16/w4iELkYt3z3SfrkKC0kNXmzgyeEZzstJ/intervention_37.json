She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent went to the principal's office in person, demanded an explanation, and was told to leave or send a letter. The principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer. But the resource officer commended the parent for staying calm. \n\nNow, the parent is upset because their 10-11 year old was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The main issue here is whether the school's program is age-appropriate and if the parent's reaction is justified.\n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some schools provide comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like consent, STIs, contraception, and various types of sexual activity. However, the appropriateness of specific content at a certain age can be a point of contention. For 5th graders, teaching about condoms and detailed sexual acts might be considered too advanced by some parents, even if the school follows its curriculum guidelines.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational, entering the principal's office without an appointment and demanding answers. The principal's response was to ask them to leave, possibly to avoid an escalation. The school resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene but commended the parent's calmness suggests that while the parent's approach was direct, it wasn't necessarily inappropriate in terms of their concern.\n\nWhether the parent is in the wrong depends on two main factors: the appropriateness of the school's curriculum and the appropriateness of the parent's actions. If the school's program is within legal and educational guidelines for that age group, then the parent's complaint might be seen as valid but handled in a way that's not the most effective. However, if the curriculum is indeed inappropriate, the parent's actions could be justified.\n\nThe parent's right to voice concerns is protected, but the method of doing so in a public manner without prior communication might be seen as confrontational. The correct approach would typically involve following the school's established procedures for parent concerns, like writing a formal letter or scheduling a meeting. However, the principal's immediate threat to involve the resource officer might indicate a lack of understanding of the parent's rights or a desire to de-escalate the situation.\n\nIn terms of the curriculum content, some argue that comprehensive sex education should start early to educate children on body autonomy, consent, and safety. Others believe that such topics should be left to parents or delayed until a higher grade. The presence of condoms in a 5th-grade class might be part of a broader education on sexual health, including contraception and disease prevention, but the age appropriateness is subjective.\n\nThe resource officer's support for the parent's actions suggests that the school's response might have been overly harsh, possibly infringing on the parent's rights to express concerns. However, the parent's method of entering the office without an appointment and demanding answers could be seen as disruptive. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's actions might not be in the wrong in terms of raising valid concerns about their child's education, but the manner in which they did so could be criticized as not following proper channels. The school's response might also be questionable if it involved threats without due process. The main issue is whether the school's curriculum is appropriate for the age group, which varies by jurisdiction and educational standards.\n"
