She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for complaining to their child's school about the sex education program. The situation involves a 5th grader (10-11 years old) being given a condom and learning about topics like oral and anal sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the content of the sex education program. In the US, sex education varies by state and school district. Some schools provide comprehensive sex education starting at a young age, while others may not. The parent is upset about the age-appropriateness of the material. The key question here is whether the school's approach is appropriate for that age group.\n\nNext, the parent's actions. They went to the principal's office directly and demanded an explanation. The principal told them to leave and threatened involving the resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended them for being calm. So, the parent's method might have been confrontational, which could be seen as inappropriate, but the principal's reaction was extreme. However, the parent's concern is about their child's education content.\n\nLegal and educational standards in the US: Schools have the authority to set curricula, including sex education, as long as they follow state guidelines. Parents can opt out if they disagree, but the school is within its rights to teach what's permitted. However, if the content is indeed inappropriate for the age group, the parent has a right to question it.\n\nThe parent's approach might be seen as confrontational, but their intent is to express concern about their child's education. The principal's threat to involve the resource officer could be an overreach. The parent isn't in the wrong for raising a concern, but their method (storming into the office) might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is the content of the sex ed program.\n\nIn some states, sex education must be age-appropriate and medically accurate. If the school is violating that, the parent has a valid point. The condom given to a 5th grader is questionable. Typically, condom distribution might be part of a program for older students. So, the parent's complaint is about content, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe school's response of threatening to involve the resource officer is problematic. The parent is not in the wrong for voicing concerns, especially if the school's actions are beyond standard educational practices for that age. The principal's refusal to engage directly and the threat could indicate overreaction, but the parent's initial approach could have been more diplomatic.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for complaining, but their method could have been improved. The main issue is the school's curriculum. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
