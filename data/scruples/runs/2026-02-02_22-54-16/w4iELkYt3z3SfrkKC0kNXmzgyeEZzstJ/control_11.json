      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent found out their 10-11 year old daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, was told to leave, and threatened with the school resource officer. The principal insisted on sending a letter instead. The resource officer commended the parent for staying calm.\n\nSo, the key points here: Age of the child, content of the curriculum, parent's reaction, and the school's response.\n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states require comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like consent, contraception, and different types of sexual activity. Others have opt-out policies or more restrictive guidelines. The parent is shocked that such topics are being taught to 5th graders. \n\nThe parent's actions: walking into the principal's office, confronting them directly, and being told to leave. The principal's response seems defensive, possibly trying to de-escalate by suggesting a letter. The resource officer's comment implies that he understands the parent's frustration and even commends their composure. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, their reaction is based on concerns about age-appropriate content. If the school is following state guidelines, then the parent might have a right to be upset but their method of confronting the issue might be inappropriate. However, the school's response (threatening to involve the resource officer) could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut the main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent is expressing a valid concern about what's being taught to their child. Confronting the principal in person might not be the best approach, but the content itself is questionable. Many people would argue that giving condoms to 10-year-olds and teaching about oral/anal sex is inappropriate. However, the school might have policies in place that parents are supposed to opt out of. \n\nThe resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene suggests that the parent's reaction, while perhaps confrontational, is understandable. So the parent's concern is valid, but their method might not be the best. However, the school's response was also problematic. \n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, I think it's more about the school's policies and whether they followed proper opt-out procedures. If the school didn't inform the parents or didn't have an opt-out process, the school could be at fault. If they did, then the parent might be overreacting. But without more info, it's hard to say. But the parent's main issue is with the content, which many would agree is inappropriate for that age. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
