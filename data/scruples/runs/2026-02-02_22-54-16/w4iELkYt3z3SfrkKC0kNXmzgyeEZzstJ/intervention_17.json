She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe parent walked into the principal's office without prior notice, demanded to know why their 5th grader was given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The principal asked them to leave and threatened to involve the school resource officer. Then the parent spoke to the officer, who commended their calmness.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the parent's actions, the school's response, and the appropriateness of the education content. \n\nFirst, the parent's approach. They went directly into the principal's office and demanded answers. That might be seen as confrontational. The principal wanted them to send a letter instead, which is a more formal process. The parent's method of immediate confrontation could be considered inappropriate. However, the parent's concern is valid if the school is providing information that the parent deems age-inappropriate.\n\nNext, the content of the sex education. In the US, sex education policies vary by state. Some states require comprehensive sex education, which might include topics like consent, STIs, and different types of sexual activity. However, giving condoms to 5th graders (ages 10-11) is unusual. Typically, condom distribution is part of programs aimed at older students who are more likely to be sexually active. The parent's shock is understandable if the school is providing materials that the parent believes are not suitable for that age group.\n\nThe principal's response, threatening to involve the resource officer, could be seen as an overreaction if the parent's concern is legitimate. However, the principal might be following protocol by directing the parent to formal channels. The fact that the resource officer supported the parent's approach by commending their calmness suggests that the parent's concern was taken seriously, at least by that officer.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Their method of confronting the issue might not be the most appropriate, but their concern about age-inappropriate content is valid. Schools have a responsibility to provide education that aligns with both legal requirements and community standards. If the school is exceeding what is appropriate for 5th graders, the parent has a right to voice their concern. However, the way they approached the principal\u2014walking in without notice and demanding answers\u2014might have been unprofessional. They should have perhaps followed a more formal process, like contacting the school via letter or a scheduled meeting.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intentions might be justified, but their method of confrontation could be considered inappropriate. However, since the resource officer supported their approach and the content given to 5th graders seems questionable, the parent's actions might be seen as understandable. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent is acting on a legitimate concern even if their method could be debated.\n"
