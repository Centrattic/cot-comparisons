She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grade child's sex education program. The situation involves the parent confronting the principal and being threatened with removal if they don't leave. The parent also mentions that the school resource officer supported their anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational standards in the US. Sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, which might include topics like consent, anatomy, and contraception. However, giving condoms to 10-11 year olds might be unusual. The parent's concern about age-appropriate content is valid because 5th graders are quite young for such topics. \n\nThe parent's approach was direct\u2014walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. While confrontational, the parent was not violent or threatening. The principal's response was to threaten involving the school resource officer, which might indicate a lack of willingness to engage in dialogue. The resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent's peacefulness suggests that the parent's reaction was not entirely unreasonable.\n\nHowever, the parent's method of addressing the issue could be seen as disruptive. A more appropriate approach might have been to follow the school's formal complaint process, like writing a letter first. But the principal had already dismissed the parent's concerns without proper discussion, which complicates things. The parent's actions were driven by concern for their child's education and well-being, which is a legitimate reason. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's intent was to address what they perceive as inappropriate content. While the method could have been improved, the underlying concern is valid. The school's response was aggressive without addressing the parent's specific issues. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
