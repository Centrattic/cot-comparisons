She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded answers after their 5th grader brought home a condom and talked about advanced topics like oral and anal sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old, which is pretty young. Teaching them about oral and anal sex, giving out condoms\u2014this could be beyond what's age-appropriate. In many places, there are guidelines for sex education that recommend starting at older ages, maybe middle or high school. So the school might be overstepping, but that's not the main question here.\n\nThe parent's reaction: they went directly to the principal, demanded to know why, and were told to leave. The principal threatened to call the school resource officer. However, the SRO actually commended the parent for speaking up peacefully. So the parent's approach was confrontational but non-violent.\n\nNow, the school's response: the principal's immediate reaction was to send the parent out and suggest writing a letter. But the SRO's reaction was more supportive. Maybe the school has policies about how parent concerns should be handled\u2014like submitting a written complaint first. If that's the case, the parent might have bypassed the proper procedure by showing up unannounced.\n\nBut the parent's main concern is about the content of the program. If the school is indeed providing inappropriate education, the parent has a right to be upset and to voice their concerns. However, the method they used\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers\u2014might not be the best way. Schools usually have protocols for parent complaints, so maybe the parent should have followed those steps first.\n\nOn the other hand, if the school is violating local, state, or federal guidelines regarding age-appropriate education, the parent has a valid reason to protest. The SRO's support suggests that the parent's actions were seen as reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a bit of a balance. The content of the education might be questionable, but the parent's approach could have been more in line with school procedures. However, the principal's threat to call the SRO and the SRO's later commendation might indicate that the principal's response was overly aggressive. The parent's right to express concern is valid, but the method could have been handled differently. But since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, considering both the content and the approach, maybe the answer leans towards \"No,\" the parent isn't in the wrong because they had a legitimate concern and the school's reaction was excessive. However, they could have followed the correct procedure first. But since the school was possibly violating guidelines, the parent's actions are justified. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B, No.\n"
