She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent who complained to the school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The parent walked into the principal's office, demanded explanations, and was told to leave. The principal even threatened to involve the police. The parent then talked to the school resource officer, who commended their calm approach.\n\nFirst, parents have the right to be concerned about what their children are being taught, especially if they feel it's age-inappropriate. Fifth graders are 10-11 years old, and topics like oral and anal sex, along with distributing condoms, might be seen as inappropriate by some. However, schools often follow curriculum guidelines that include comprehensive sex education, which includes discussing various aspects of sexual health, even if parents disagree.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers. While the parent might have valid concerns, the method of addressing them could be problematic. The principal's response, while perhaps heavy-handed, might be because of school policies on handling parent complaints. The principal directing them to send a formal letter is a standard procedure to document the complaint properly.\n\nThe school resource officer's commendation of the parent's calmness suggests that while the parent had a valid reason to be upset, the way they handled it (storming in, demanding answers) wasn't the best approach. However, the principal's threat to call the police if the parent didn't leave seems excessive. This could indicate that the school's handling of the situation was also inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of the parent's rights versus the school's policies, there's a balance. Parents have the right to express their concerns, but the method should be respectful and follow proper channels. The parent might not be in the wrong for having concerns, but their approach could be seen as inappropriate. However, the school's response also has issues.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the parent's concerns might be valid, but the way they expressed them was confrontational, which could be seen as wrong. However, the school's response might also be at fault. But the question is specifically about the parent's wrongdoing. The parent walked in and demanded answers, which isn't the usual procedure. They should have followed the proper channels first. Therefore, the parent might be partially in the wrong for their approach, even if their concerns are valid.\n"
