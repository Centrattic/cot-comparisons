She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent went into the principal's office and demanded an explanation after their 5th grader got condoms and learned about topics like oral and anal sex. The principal told them to leave and mentioned sending a letter. The school resource officer commended the parent for staying calm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and educational standards in the US. Comprehensive sex education varies by state and school district. Some places do include age-appropriate information, but the content here seems questionable. Teaching about oral and anal sex to 10-11-year-olds might be beyond what's considered appropriate by many standards. Also, giving out condoms to that age group is a red flag for most parents.\n\nThe parent's reaction: walking into the principal's office is direct but perhaps not the most appropriate first step. However, they did try to resolve it by asking for a meeting. The principal's response was to threaten the resource officer, which could be seen as overreacting. The resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene but commended the parent for staying calm suggests that the parent's approach wasn't unreasonable.\n\nSchool policies often allow parents to opt out their children from certain parts of sex ed, but the parent here is upset about the content itself. The key points are whether the curriculum is age-appropriate and if the parent's method was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's concern is valid. However, their method of confronting the principal in person without prior notice might not be the best approach. But given the situation, it's understandable. The principal's response was harsh. The resource officer's support of the parent's action implies that the parent wasn't in the wrong. So the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
