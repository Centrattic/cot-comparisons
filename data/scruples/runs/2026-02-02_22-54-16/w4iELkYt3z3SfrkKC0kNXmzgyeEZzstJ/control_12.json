She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the school's sex education program is in the wrong. The parent brought their daughter to school, confronted the principal, and was told to leave. The principal said to send a letter instead. The school resource officer commended the parent for not making a scene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old. The parent is upset because the program includes condoms and topics like oral and anal sex. The key question is whether the content is age-appropriate according to educational standards.\n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some states require comprehensive sex education, including topics like consent, contraception, and different types of sexual activity. For example, in some states, teaching about condoms and STIs might be part of the curriculum even for younger kids. However, if the school is teaching advanced topics like oral or anal sex to 5th graders, that might be pushing the age limits of what's considered appropriate.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational, walking into the principal's office and demanding answers. While expressing concerns is valid, doing so in a disruptive manner could be seen as inappropriate. The principal's response was to ask them to leave, suggesting that the method of communication was not acceptable, even if the concern itself might be valid.\n\nHowever, the parent did get support from the school resource officer, who thought their reaction was understandable. That might indicate that the school's actions were questionable. The parent's right to be concerned about their child's education and the appropriateness of the content is valid. But the way they expressed it might have been too aggressive, leading to the conflict with the principal.\n\nSo, the parent's concern is legitimate if the curriculum is indeed inappropriate for the age group. But the method of addressing it\u2014confronting the principal in person without following the proper channels\u2014could be seen as wrong. Parents are usually encouraged to follow school procedures for complaints, like sending a letter or meeting through official channels. The parent's actions, while passionate, might not align with the proper way to raise such concerns.\n\nTherefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong regarding the content of the program, but their approach to addressing the issue could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the curriculum is inappropriate, the parent isn't wrong for complaining. But if the school's program is within guidelines, then the parent's complaint might be unfounded. The answer depends on the appropriateness of the curriculum and the parent's method of complaint.\n\nGiven that the school resource officer supported the parent's reaction, it's possible that the curriculum is indeed inappropriate. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong for raising the issue, even if their method was confrontational.\n"
