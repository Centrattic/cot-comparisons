She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office directly and demanded an explanation after their 5th grader received a condom and learned about topics like oral and anal sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's age-appropriate for sex education. In the US, there's a lot of debate about this. Some states have laws about what can be taught. For 5th graders (10-11 years old), teaching about condoms and more advanced topics might be contentious. Some parents might find it too explicit, others might support comprehensive sex ed. So the content itself is a gray area depending on location and curriculum standards.\n\nNext, the parent's approach. They went straight to the principal's office, which could be seen as confrontational. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns\u2014like sending a letter or meeting through proper channels. By storming in and demanding answers, the parent might have overstepped. The principal's reaction (telling them to leave and threatening the resource officer) indicates that the method was inappropriate, even if the concern was valid.\n\nHowever, the principal's threat to involve the school resource officer might be an overreaction. The resource officer's comment that he'd have made a scene and commended the parent for being peaceful suggests that the parent's intent wasn't violent or disruptive. The parent was expressing a legitimate concern, albeit in a direct way.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is valid, but the method was flawed. They should have followed proper procedures, even if they were upset. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the parent is in the wrong) because their approach was inappropriate, though their concern might be understandable. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the actions matter more than the intent here.\n"
