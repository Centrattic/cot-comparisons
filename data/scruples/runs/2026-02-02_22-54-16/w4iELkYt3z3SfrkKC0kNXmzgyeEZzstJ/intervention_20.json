She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th-grade child's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office without an appointment and demanded answers when they found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex, which they consider age-inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. Confronting the principal in person, not through proper channels, might be seen as disruptive. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, like sending a letter or scheduling a meeting. The parent's immediate reaction was to go directly to the principal's office, which led to being asked to leave and even a threat of involving the school resource officer. That seems aggressive or at least not following protocol.\n\nBut then, the principal's response was to threaten removal, which could be seen as overly harsh. The school resource officer commending the parent for being peaceful adds another layer\u2014maybe the principal overreacted. However, the parent's initial approach was confrontational. Even if they had valid concerns, walking in unannounced and demanding answers might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the content of the sex education program itself is questionable. Teaching 5th graders about anal sex and giving out condoms at age 10-11 is likely beyond the developmental stage of most children. There's a debate about age-appropriate sex education, but giving condoms to 5th graders is definitely unusual. The parent's concern is valid, but their method of addressing it may be the issue.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions are understandable and the school's program might be problematic, the parent's approach was impulsive and didn't follow proper procedures. They should have used the school's established channels for parent complaints. Therefore, the parent might be at fault for not handling it appropriately, but the school's response was also harsh. However, the question is about the parent being in the wrong. The answer would be that the parent is partially at fault for their approach, but the school's program is questionable. But according to AITA standards, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the content is inappropriate. Hmm, this is tricky. I need to decide between A and B based on the parent's actions and the situation.\n"
