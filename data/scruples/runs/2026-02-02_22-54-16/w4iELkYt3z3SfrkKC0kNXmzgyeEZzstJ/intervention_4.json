She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who complained about the 5th-grade sex education program is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex, which they found inappropriate for that age. The parent confronted the principal in person, was told to leave, and then talked to the school resource officer who seemed to agree with them.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is the school's approach age-appropriate? In many places, comprehensive sex education does start at a young age, but there's a debate about what's appropriate. Some states have laws about what can be taught and whether parents need to be notified. The parent's reaction was immediate and confrontational, walking into the principal's office. The principal's response was to threaten removal, which might be a school policy if they feel it's a disruption.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent is expressing concern about content they find inappropriate. The resource officer supported their frustration. However, the method of confronting the principal in person without prior notice might be seen as disruptive. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, like sending a letter or setting up a meeting. The parent bypassed that, leading to the principal's reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's concerns might be valid if the school is indeed teaching content that's beyond what's appropriate for 5th graders. The resource officer's comments suggest that even he would have been upset, indicating that maybe the school's approach is problematic. \n\nSo, balancing the two: the parent's concerns might be legitimate, but their method of addressing them was abrupt and could be seen as not following proper channels. Therefore, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach might have been inappropriate. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the content was inappropriate and the parent's right to object versus the school's procedures. If the school is following guidelines, the parent's reaction might still be justified, but the method could be questioned. But the resource officer's support might indicate the school isn't handling it well. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because the content might be inappropriate, and the resource officer's response shows some validation. So the answer is B.\n"
