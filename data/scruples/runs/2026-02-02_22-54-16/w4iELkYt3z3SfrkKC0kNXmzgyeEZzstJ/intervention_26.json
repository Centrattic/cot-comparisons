She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex ed program. The situation involves a 5th grader being given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. 5th graders in the US are typically around 10-11 years old. The parent found out their daughter was given a condom and taught advanced topics, which they found inappropriate. The parent confronted the principal in person, leading to a conflict where the principal told them to leave. The school resource officer, however, commended the parent for staying calm.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is the content age-appropriate? Are condoms given to kids that young? Is the parent's reaction justified?\n\nIn the US, sex education policies vary by state and school district. Some states require comprehensive sex ed, while others allow opt-out. The parent might not have been aware of the curriculum in advance. However, teaching topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11 year olds could be seen as too advanced. Similarly, providing condoms to that age group might raise concerns, unless it's part of a specific program targeting older students. \n\nThe parent's reaction is immediate and confrontational. Walking into the principal's office without prior notice could be seen as disruptive, but their concern is valid if they believe the content is inappropriate. The principal's threat to involve the school resource officer might be an overreaction, but the parent's approach could have been more constructive, like following standard procedures for parent concerns.\n\nThe resource officer's comment that he would have made a scene and commended the parent for being peaceful suggests that the school might acknowledge the parent's right to be upset. However, the parent's method of confrontation might not be the best way to address the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intent is to protect their child, which is a valid concern. However, the approach of confronting the principal in person without prior communication might not be the most effective. The school's response could be based on policy, but if the curriculum indeed exceeds appropriate age levels, the school might be at fault. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for their concern, but their method of addressing it could be improved. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the school's program is indeed inappropriate, the parent is justified. If the school's curriculum is in line with policies, then the parent's reaction might be seen as overstepping. But given the details, it's possible the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
