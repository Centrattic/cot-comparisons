She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office, demanded answers, and was told to leave. The principal even mentioned the school resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. 5th grade is around 10-11 years old. The parent is upset because their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent's reaction was to confront the principal directly, which led to some tension but the resource officer commended them for staying calm.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Is the content of the sex ed program appropriate for that age? 2) Did the parent handle the situation appropriately?\n\nRegarding the first point, sex education varies by school district and state laws. In some areas, comprehensive sex ed includes topics like consent and contraception at a young age. However, giving out condoms to 10-year-olds might be controversial. Some might argue it's about preparedness and safety, while others see it as inappropriate for that age group.\n\nAs for the parent's actions, walking into the principal's office and demanding answers without prior notice could be seen as confrontational. However, the parent wasn't violent or threatening, just expressing concern. The principal's response of threatening to involve the resource officer seems harsh. The resource officer's comment that he would have made a bigger scene suggests that the parent's approach, while direct, wasn't unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of protocol, parents usually have the right to express concerns about school policies. However, the method of expressing those concerns might be more effective if done through proper channels, like a meeting request or written communication. But in this case, the parent's immediate reaction might have been due to shock and concern, which is understandable.\n\nSo, considering the appropriateness of the content and the parent's right to raise concerns, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The school's handling of the parent's complaints could also be questioned, especially with the resource officer's support. Therefore, the answer is likely B: the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
