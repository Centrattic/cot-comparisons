She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The user provided a scenario where a parent is upset about their 5th-grade daughter receiving sex education that includes condoms and topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal, leading to a tense situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders are around 10-11 years old. In the US, sex education policies can vary by state and district. Some places mandate comprehensive sex education, which includes information on contraception and various aspects of sexual health. However, the appropriateness of specific topics at this age can be debated.\n\nThe parent is objecting to the content, specifically the distribution of condoms and teaching about advanced topics. They went directly to the principal's office without prior communication, which might be seen as abrupt. The principal's response was to ask them to leave and suggest sending a letter instead. The school resource officer's comment seems to indicate some understanding of the parent's frustration but also highlights the parent's approach as more measured than expected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's actions involved confronting the school without prior notice, which might be considered confrontational. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, like written communication or appointments. However, the parent's intent was to express concerns about their child's education, which is a valid right. The school's response could be seen as dismissive, but the parent's method of confrontation might not align with proper channels.\n\nLegal and policy aspects: Depending on the state, parents might have the right to opt their children out of sex education. If the school didn't inform parents of this option, that's a different issue. However, the parent's approach of entering the principal's office abruptly could be seen as violating school protocols, even if their concerns are legitimate.\n\nEmotional aspect: The parent is clearly upset and wants to protect their child. Their actions, while direct, stem from concern. However, the method of confrontation without following proper channels might be seen as inconsiderate of school policies.\n\nBalancing the parent's rights to be involved in their child's education against the school's responsibility to provide a curriculum as per state guidelines. If the school is following the law, the parent's objection is more about curriculum content rather than the method of delivery.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's concerns are valid and they have the right to object, the manner in which they approached the school by entering the principal's office unannounced and demanding answers might not be the appropriate method. The school's protocol usually expects formal communication. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong in terms of the approach, even if the underlying concerns are legitimate.\n"
