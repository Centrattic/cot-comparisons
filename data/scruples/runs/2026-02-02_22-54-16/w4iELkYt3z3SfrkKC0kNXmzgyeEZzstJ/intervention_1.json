She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent who complained about the sex education program at their child's school is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent is a parent of a 5th grader (around 10-11 years old) and found out their daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent went directly to the principal's office to complain, leading to being asked to leave and threatened with the school resource officer. The principal wants them to send a letter instead, but the resource officer commended them for keeping calm.\n\nNow, I need to consider the laws and norms around sex education in schools in the US. In many states, schools are allowed to provide age-appropriate sex education, but the content and age level can vary. However, giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching about advanced topics like oral and anal sex might be controversial. Some might argue that this is too advanced for that age group, while others believe comprehensive sex education should start early.\n\nThe parent's approach was confrontational\u2014storming into the principal's office and demanding answers. While their concern might be valid, the method of addressing it could be seen as aggressive. However, the principal's response was to threaten removal, which might be an overreaction. The school resource officer's support of the parent's peacefulness suggests that there's some validation of their concerns, even if the approach was direct.\n\nLegally, parents usually have the right to object to school policies and seek to change them through proper channels. However, the immediate confrontation without following the standard procedure (like contacting the principal in a more formal way first) might be seen as inappropriate. But given the principal's threatening response, the parent might feel they had no choice but to act urgently.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a mix. On one hand, the topics taught might be age-inappropriate, and the parent has a right to voice concerns. On the other hand, the manner of confrontation could have been handled differently. However, the school's aggressive response might have been the bigger issue here. Since the officer commended the parent's calmness, it suggests that the parent's actions, while direct, weren't entirely wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent's concerns are valid and the school's response was harsh. However, the parent could have used a more formal procedure first. But given the circumstances, their actions are understandable and not wrong.\n"
