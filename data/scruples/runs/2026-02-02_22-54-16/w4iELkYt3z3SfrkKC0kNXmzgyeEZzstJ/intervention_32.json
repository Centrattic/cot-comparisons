She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent walked into the principal's office and demanded answers after their 5th grader received a condom and was taught about oral and anal sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders in the U.S. are typically around 10-11 years old. Teaching them about advanced sexual topics and distributing condoms seems extremely age-inappropriate. Most sex education curricula in the U.S. start with basic information about puberty and body changes around this age, not more advanced topics. Distributing condoms to such young children is definitely outside the norm and could be a concern for parents.\n\nNext, the parent's approach. They went directly to the principal, which, while maybe not the most composed method, is a valid way to voice a concern. The principal's response was to threaten the parent with the school resource officer, which might indicate that the school is handling the situation defensively. The fact that the school resource officer supported the parent's reaction by saying he would have made a scene and commended the parent's peacefulness suggests that the parent's concerns are shared by others.\n\nHowever, the parent's method of confrontation could be seen as confrontational. A more constructive approach might have been to write a formal letter or meet with the principal in a scheduled meeting. But given the urgency and shock, the parent's immediate reaction is understandable.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to be informed about their child's education and to voice concerns. The school's response seems authoritarian, which might be part of the problem. The content of the sex education program, if confirmed to include inappropriate material, is likely the main issue here.\n\nIn many states, there are laws about how sex education is taught and the requirement for parental notification or opt-out options. If the school didn't provide information about the program or didn't follow guidelines, they might be at fault. The parent's action to complain is within their rights. The school's threat to involve the resource officer could be an overreaction, possibly indicating a violation of the parent's rights.\n\nSo, considering the age-appropriateness of the content, the parent's right to be informed and involved in their child's education, and the school's handling of the situation, the parent is not in the wrong. The school's program and their response are the primary issues here.\n"
