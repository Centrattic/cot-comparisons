She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about their 5th grader's sex education program. The parent went to the principal's office and confronted them about the use of condoms and teaching topics like oral and anal sex to 10-11 year olds. The principal told them to leave and mention the school resource officer, but the officer actually commended the parent for their calm approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content for a 5th grader. In the US, comprehensive sex education varies by state and school district. Generally, 5th grade is around 10-11 years old, and while some states start sex ed earlier, the topics mentioned (condoms, oral/anal sex) might be considered advanced or inappropriate for that age group. Parents have the right to object to their children's curriculum if they feel it's unsuitable, especially if they have concerns about age-appropriateness.\n\nNext, the parent's method of expressing their concern. They went directly to the principal's office and confronted them. The principal's response was dismissive and even threatening, which is concerning. However, the parent's actions were not aggressive\u2014despite being told to leave, they sought to communicate, and the school resource officer supported their approach. This suggests that the parent's actions, while direct, were not inappropriate. Confrontation is different from being in the wrong; parents are entitled to advocate for their child's education.\n\nThe school's response is also a factor. The principal's immediate dismissal and threat of removal could be seen as overreacting, especially when the school resource officer agreed that the parent was acting reasonably. This might indicate that the school's handling of the situation was poor, which could reflect on the school's policies more than the parent's actions.\n\nHowever, there's a line between expressing concerns and causing disruption. The parent did go into the principal's office and demanded an explanation, which might be seen as confrontational. But given the principal's response, it's possible the school is not open to dialogue, which complicates the situation. The parent's right to object to the curriculum is valid, and their method, while direct, wasn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all aspects: the appropriateness of the content, the parent's right to voice concerns, and the school's response, the parent is likely not in the wrong. The key points are the age-appropriateness of the topics and the parent's right to advocate for their child. The principal's reaction seems excessive, which might indicate the school's policies aren't well-aligned with community standards.\n"
