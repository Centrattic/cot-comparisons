She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for complaining about the school's sex education program. The parent's daughter was given a condom and taught about topics like oral and anal sex in 5th grade, which is around age 10-11. The parent confronted the principal directly, leading to a tense situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. In the U.S., sex education policies vary by state and district. Some schools provide comprehensive sex ed, which includes information on consent, contraception, and different types of sexual activity. However, the age at which such topics are introduced can be controversial. The parent is upset that their 10-year-old received condoms and learned about advanced topics, which they consider age-inappropriate.\n\nNext, the parent's actions: they went directly to the principal's office, demanded explanations, and were told to leave or send a letter. The principal threatened involving the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who supported their frustration and commended their calmness. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to be informed about school curricula and to express concerns, especially regarding their children. However, the method of confronting the principal\u2014storming into the office and demanding\u2014might be seen as confrontational. Schools often prefer formal complaints through proper channels. But the parent's right to object is valid. \n\nThe key points are whether the content was appropriate and the parent's method was reasonable. If the school's program included topics that the parent found inappropriate, the parent isn't in the wrong for voicing concerns. The school's response, threatening removal and suggesting a formal letter, might be standard protocol, but the parent's actions were a direct reaction to a troubling situation. The fact that the resource officer supported the parent's frustration suggests that the parent's concerns are legitimate.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for raising concerns, even if their approach was direct. The answer would be B (No).\n"
