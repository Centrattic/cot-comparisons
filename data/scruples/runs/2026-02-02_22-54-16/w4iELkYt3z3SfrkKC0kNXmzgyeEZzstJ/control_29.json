She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who's upset because their 5th-grade daughter (around 10-11 years old) was given a condom and taught about oral and anal sex in a school's sex education program. The parent went directly to the principal's office, demanded answers, and the principal threatened to involve the school resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who commended them for staying calm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content being taught. In the US, sex education varies by state and school district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex education, which includes topics like contraception and different types of sexual activity, while others allow more parental control. For 5th graders, teaching about oral and anal sex might be considered advanced. But I'm not sure what's standard. Maybe some programs introduce basic concepts like consent, anatomy, and safer sex practices at a young age, but the mention of specific sexual acts and providing condoms seems questionable for that age group.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction: walking into the principal's office without an appointment and demanding to know why the school is providing condoms and discussing advanced topics. The principal asked them to leave and threatened to call the resource officer. The parent then spoke to the officer, who agreed that they would be angry and commended the parent's calmness. So the principal's response was harsh, while the officer seemed to validate the parent's concern.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent is voicing a legitimate concern about age-appropriate education. However, the method of confronting the principal might be too confrontational. While the parent's intent was to complain, entering the office unannounced and demanding answers could be seen as disruptive. The principal's response (threatening removal) might be excessive, but the parent's approach might not have been the most appropriate way to raise their concern. The officer's support suggests that the parent had a valid issue, but the manner of addressing it could have been more constructive. However, the core issue is whether the school's program is age-appropriate. If the program is violating state educational guidelines, the parent is right to object. If it's within guidelines, the parent might be overreacting. But given that condoms given to 5th graders and teaching about oral/anal sex might be beyond what's standard for that age, the parent's complaint is justified. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is likely \"No.\"\n"
