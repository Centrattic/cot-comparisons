She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who complained to their child's school about the sex education program is in the wrong. The parent went into the principal's office, demanded to know why condoms and advanced topics were being taught to 5th graders, and the principal asked them to leave. The parent then spoke to the school resource officer, who commended them for being peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the content. 5th grade is around 10-11 years old. Teaching about oral and anal sex, giving out condoms\u2014does that align with what's age-appropriate? I think there's a lot of debate here. Some argue that comprehensive sex education includes teaching about all forms of sexual activity, including safer practices, even at a young age. Others, like the parent, might find it inappropriate for that age group.\n\nNext, the parent's method of addressing the issue. The parent went directly to the principal's office, demanded answers, and the principal asked them to leave. The parent then spoke to the resource officer. The principal's response was to threaten involving the school resource officer, but the officer actually supported the parent's right to be upset. So the parent's approach was confrontational, which might be seen as aggressive or inappropriate, but the content they're objecting to is the main issue.\n\nThe key points here are: Is the parent justified in their complaint? And is their method of confronting the school acceptable? If the school's program includes topics that the parent finds inappropriate, they have the right to voice their concerns. However, the method of confrontation\u2014storming into the office and demanding answers\u2014might not be the best approach. Schools often have procedures for such concerns, like sending a letter or meeting with a specific staff member. The principal's reaction might be due to the parent's approach rather than the content itself.\n\nBut the parent's main argument is about the content. If the school is providing comprehensive sex education, which includes topics that are controversial, the parent's right to object might be valid, especially if they believe it's inappropriate. The resource officer's support suggests that the parent's concerns are understandable, even if the method was confrontational.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The answer depends on two factors: the content's appropriateness and the parent's method of protest. If the content is indeed inappropriate for 5th graders, the parent isn't wrong in objecting. The method might be questionable, but the core issue is the content. The principal's response was to threaten removal, which might indicate an overreaction. The resource officer's support implies that the parent's concerns are valid. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong for raising a concern about what they perceive as inappropriate content, even if their approach could have been more diplomatic.\n"
