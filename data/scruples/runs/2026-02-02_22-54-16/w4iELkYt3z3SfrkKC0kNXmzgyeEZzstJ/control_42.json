She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the parent is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's appropriate to complain to the school about their sex education program. The parent is upset because their 5th grader received a condom and was taught about topics like oral and anal sex. They went to the principal's office and were told to leave, with a threat involving the resource officer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Fifth graders in the US are typically 10-11 years old. At that age, are these topics considered age-appropriate? I know that sex education varies by state and school district. Some places start comprehensive sex ed in elementary school, while others wait until middle or high school. The parent might be following different standards than the school's policy.\n\nThe parent's reaction was to confront the principal in person. That could be seen as aggressive, especially if they entered the office without an appointment. Schools usually have procedures for parent concerns, like contacting via email or scheduling a meeting. By storming in and demanding answers, the parent might have overstepped, leading the principal to ask them to leave.\n\nHowever, the parent's concern about the content being taught could be valid. If the curriculum includes topics that are too advanced for 5th graders, especially distributing condoms, that's a point of contention. The parent is within their rights to question the school's approach, especially if they believe it's inappropriate. The principal's response\u2014threatening to call the resource officer\u2014seems excessive if the parent is just expressing concern, even if the manner was abrupt.\n\nAlso, the school resource officer (usually a police officer) threatening the parent might be an overreaction. The principal's actions here could be the issue, as they may have mishandled the parent's complaint. The fact that the resource officer commended the parent's calmness suggests that the parent's approach, while direct, wasn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the parent's actions were perhaps not the most appropriate (storming into the office without notice), but their concern about the content being taught is valid. The school's response seems harsh. So, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they raised a valid concern, even if their method was poor, they're not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but there are nuances.\n"
