She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who complained to the school about the sex ed program is in the wrong. The situation involves a 5th grader being given condoms and taught about topics like oral and anal sex. The parent confronted the principal directly and was told to leave. The principal even threatened to involve the school resource officer, but the officer commended the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the school's actions. In the US, sex education policies vary by state and district. Some states mandate comprehensive sex ed, while others leave it to local decisions. The parent is upset because the content might be age-inappropriate for 10-11-year-olds. Teaching about condoms and specific sexual acts at that age could be controversial. However, some curricula include this information to educate on safe sex practices, even if it's advanced.\n\nNext, the parent's reaction. They went directly to the principal's office, demanded an explanation, and were told to leave. The parent's approach was confrontational, which might not be the best way to address concerns. Schools typically have procedures for parents to follow, like formal complaints or meetings with administrators. The parent's public confrontation might have been inappropriate, even if their concerns are valid.\n\nThe school's response: the principal's threat to involve the resource officer could be an overreaction, but the parent's method of addressing the issue was disruptive. The resource officer's commendation of the parent's peacefulness suggests that while the parent was upset, they tried to handle it calmly. However, the principal's directive to send a letter instead of a direct confrontation is standard procedure. The parent bypassed that, leading to the conflict.\n\nLegal aspects: Parents usually have the right to opt their children out of certain sex ed topics, but the school's approach might still be within policy. The content's appropriateness is subjective, but if it's against local regulations or the parent's beliefs, they have a right to object. However, the method of objection matters. Public confrontation and disruption aren't the best ways to address such issues.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but their approach was flawed. They should have followed the school's proper procedures for complaints. The school's response was perhaps too harsh, but the parent's actions were disruptive. The answer might hinge on whether the parent's method was appropriate despite their valid concerns.\n"
