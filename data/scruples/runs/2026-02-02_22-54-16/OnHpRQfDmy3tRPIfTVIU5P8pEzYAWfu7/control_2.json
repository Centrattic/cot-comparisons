Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates dividing rent based on room sizes. The main issue is that the author and another roommate, Y, had an agreement about the bigger room's rent, and now another roommate, X, is upset.\n\nFirst, when they first moved in, the author and Y decided to use a random.org roll to pick who gets the bigger room. The author won. Then, after three days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay an extra $30 a month. The author agreed, so Y took the big room, and the author accepted $30 less from their rent. Now X is mad because he's paying the same as the author, but the author is getting $30 less because of the deal with Y.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the initial agreement between the author and Y, and whether X was part of those decisions. The original setup was between the author and Y. X didn't participate in the random selection or the subsequent payment arrangement. So maybe the problem is that X wasn't included in those discussions. \n\nBut wait, when the author says they asked X and Y who would take the big room, maybe X didn't care. The author might have thought that if X didn't want the big room, it's between them and Y. However, since all three share the apartment and rent is split, the fact that X is now paying the same as the author but the author is getting less rent because of the deal with Y might make X feel it's unfair.\n\nIs the author wrong for making that deal without involving X? It depends on the initial agreement. If all three agreed on splitting rent in some way, but then a private deal was made between the author and Y, that could be unfair to X. If the original agreement was that each roommate would pay based on room size, and then a side deal changed that without consulting X, then X's complaint might be valid. \n\nBut if the initial setup was that the big room was up for grabs between the author and Y, and X didn't want it, then maybe the author had the right to negotiate the price with Y. However, the issue is that the overall rent split affects X. If the total rent is divided equally among all three, but the author is receiving extra money from Y, that would create an imbalance in how the rent is distributed. \n\nWait, but if Y is paying $30 to the author, is that effectively making Y pay more rent? Because the total rent is fixed. If the original rent per person was, say, $X, but Y is now paying $X + $30 to the author, then Y is effectively paying more for the bigger room, and the author is getting that money. But if X is still paying the original amount, that's unequal. However, if the total rent is split equally, but the author is getting $30 from Y, that might mean the author is effectively paying $30 less. But X is still paying his share. \n\nSo maybe the problem is that the author didn't adjust their own rent. If the total rent is split equally, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, then the author's net payment is lower, which could be seen as unfair to X. X is paying the same as the author, but the author is effectively getting a discount. \n\nBut if the author and Y made an agreement that Y pays the author $30 to have the bigger room, perhaps that's a private arrangement. However, if the total rent isn't adjusted, then X is stuck paying the same as the author, but the author is getting money from Y. This could create an imbalance. \n\nSo, maybe the author is wrong in not involving X in the rent adjustment. If the original rent was split equally, then the deal between Y and the author creates an unfair advantage for the author at X's expense. X didn't agree to that arrangement, so he's being treated unfairly. Therefore, the author should have considered X's share as well, perhaps adjusting the rent so that everyone's contribution is based on room size, or at least involving X in the decision. \n\nAnother angle: if the initial random selection was between the author and Y, and X wasn't interested, then the author and Y had the right to decide. However, when Y takes the big room and pays extra, the author is effectively getting less rent, which affects how the total rent is split. If the original agreement was that rooms are priced equally, then the author's action is changing that without consulting X. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not adjusting their own rent in a way that's fair to X. The correct approach would be to split rent based on room size for all roommates, not just two of them. Therefore, the author's arrangement with Y is unfair to X, making the author at fault.\n"
