Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and the money involved. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asks X and Y who wants the big room. X doesn't care, Y wants it. The author also wants it. They discuss options\u2014random draw or paying extra. Y thinks it's unfair if the higher earner (author) pays more, so they do a random.org draw. Author wins the big room.\n\nThen, three days later, Y comes back saying they need the big room for their bed and offers to pay $30/month more. The author agrees, so Y gets the big room by paying the extra. Now X is mad because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming them.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about fairness and agreements. The initial agreement was a random draw, which the author won. Then Y approached the author later, and they made a private agreement where Y pays $30 extra. The problem arises because X wasn't involved in that second agreement and feels left out. \n\nIs it fair for the author to accept money from Y to switch rooms? Well, the original agreement was the random draw. If all three roommates needed to agree on the room assignments and payments, then maybe the author should have included X in the discussion. But the way it's described, the author and Y made the deal without X's input. \n\nX's complaint is about unequal rent based on room size. If the apartment's rent is split equally among all three, but the author is in a smaller room and pays less because Y is covering the $30, that might create an imbalance. However, perhaps the roommates had an understanding that the big room would require higher rent, but in this case, the author gave up the big room to Y for that extra $30, effectively making Y pay more. \n\nBut X is upset because he's in a smaller room but pays the same as the author. The core issue is whether the author's deal with Y affects X's rent. If the total rent for the apartment is fixed and split three ways, then if Y is paying the author $30, that's just between them. But if the rent isn't split equally based on room size, maybe there's an issue. However, the original problem was about who gets the room, not about splitting rent. \n\nAnother angle: when they did the random draw, the author had a right to the big room. Y then offered to buy that right for $30/month. That's a mutual agreement between two parties. Unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments require consensus, the author might not be wrong. However, since X is now upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is in a smaller one as well, maybe X feels like the initial agreement was undermined. \n\nBut X didn't participate in the initial draw or the subsequent agreement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they made a deal with Y, and X's issue is that he didn't get a say. However, if the room assignments were supposed to be agreed upon by all three, then the author might have been wrong to deal with Y without X's consent. But the problem is that the initial agreement was a random draw between two people (since X didn't care), and then a private agreement followed. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author's agreement with Y was done without considering X's potential feelings or the overall fairness. Since X is now upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less, maybe the author should have considered X's perspective. Alternatively, if the rent was split equally regardless of room size, then maybe the author's deal with Y is a private matter. \n\nBut if the total rent for the apartment is split three ways, and Y is paying more to the author (not to the landlord), then technically, the author is getting more money from Y, which could be seen as unequal. However, if the room assignment is based on mutual agreements between roommates, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a legitimate claim to the room and then made a fair deal with Y. However, X's complaint is valid in that the room sizes affect rent distribution. But unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments require consensus, the author's actions are justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
