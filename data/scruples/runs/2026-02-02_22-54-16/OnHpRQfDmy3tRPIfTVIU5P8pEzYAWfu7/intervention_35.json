Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for charging a roommate $30 extra a month to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three rooms of different sizes. Before moving in, they decided to use a random number generator to assign the bigger room. The OP won the big room. After three days, Y (another roommate) wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 extra for the big room. The OP agreed. Now, X is upset because he thinks it's unfair that OP gets to pay less even though they have the same size room.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the OP act wrong by charging Y to switch rooms? Let's consider the initial agreement. They used a random generator to assign the big room. Then, Y wanted to switch. The OP offered a deal where Y pays $30 more a month. Since the big room is more desirable, it's reasonable that someone might be willing to pay extra for it. If the initial agreement was only a random assignment without any financial terms, the OP might have the right to negotiate a switch. However, X wasn't part of the agreement and is now upset about the difference in rent. \n\nBut the problem is whether the OP is scamming by charging the extra money. If all parties agreed to the initial random assignment and then Y wanted to switch, the OP is within their rights to charge for that switch. However, maybe the issue is that the OP didn't involve X in the decision, but X's grievance is about the financial aspect, not the switch itself. Since the rooms are different sizes, the rent should ideally reflect that difference. Maybe splitting the rent equally doesn't account for the larger room's value. If the OP is paying less for a bigger room, that's unfair to the others. But in this case, the OP switched to the bigger room and then allowed Y to switch back by paying extra. Wait, no, the OP was in the big room, and Y wanted it, so Y pays the OP $30 each month. So OP is effectively getting $30 extra from Y, which makes OP's room equal in size to X's, but OP is only paying 30 less. Maybe that's where the confusion is. The OP is not charging X, but X is upset because he's paying the same as the OP even though his room is smaller. Wait, no. Wait, the big room is bigger than the other two. So X and the OP have the same room size now? Wait, OP originally had the big room. Y wanted it and paid $30 to OP. So after the switch, Y has the big room, and OP is in a smaller room. Wait, no. Let me read again.\n\nOriginal setup: The big room is assigned to OP via random.org. Then Y wants it and offers to pay $30 to OP each month to switch. So Y gives OP $30, and Y takes the big room, and OP moves to the smaller room. Wait, but the problem is that X is now upset because he has a smaller room and OP is paying less. Wait, no. Wait, the OP was in the big room and then Y takes it and pays the OP $30. So OP is now in a smaller room. But X is still in a smaller room as well. Wait, maybe X is in a different room. Let me clarify the room assignments. Initially, three rooms: big, medium, small? Or two small and one big. So three people: two small and one big. OP got the big room via random. Then Y wanted it and paid OP $30 to switch. So Y is now in the big room, OP is in a small room. X is in the other small room. So X is upset because he's in a small room and paying the same as OP, who is also in a small room. Wait, but OP was originally in the big room and now in a small one. But the problem is that the rent isn't adjusted. The total rent is split equally, but the big room is worth more. So if OP is now in a small room, then X is also in a small room, but Y is in the big room. So X is upset that Y is paying more for the big room, but OP is also in a small room and paying the same as X. Wait, but OP is in a small room now. So X is in a small room and OP is in a small room. Both paying the same rent. Y is in the big room and paying an extra $30 to OP. But the total rent is split equally, so maybe the problem is that Y's payment to OP is on top of the regular rent. So the total rent is split equally among all three, but Y is giving OP an additional $30. So X is not part of that arrangement. Therefore, X is paying the same as OP, but OP is getting $30 from Y. So effectively, OP is making $30 more than X each month. That's probably why X is upset. Because X is paying the same as OP, but OP is getting an extra $30. Therefore, OP is in a better financial position than X. So X feels it's unfair. But is OP in the wrong? \n\nThe question is whether it's fair for OP to charge Y for the big room. If the initial agreement was to assign rooms via random, then after that, if someone wants to switch, they can negotiate. However, if the rent is split equally regardless of room size, then it's possible that the person in the bigger room is getting a better deal. In this case, Y is paying the same base rent as everyone else but is getting the bigger room. However, in this scenario, Y is paying OP an extra $30, which might be to compensate OP for moving to a smaller room. Wait, but if OP was in the big room and now is in a small one, perhaps they should have adjusted the rent. So maybe the issue is that the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. If the big room is worth more, then the person in the big room should pay more. But in this case, the initial agreement was to assign via random. Then Y wants to switch and offers to pay OP $30. That's a private agreement between Y and OP, not involving the rent split with the landlord. So X is upset because he's paying the same as OP, who is now in a small room but is receiving $30 from Y. Therefore, OP is effectively getting an extra $30 from Y, which isn't part of the standard rent split. So X is paying the same rent as OP but OP is getting more money. That's unfair to X. So the problem is that the financial arrangement between Y and OP is creating an imbalance in their personal finances, which affects the fairness in the apartment. \n\nSo, in a shared apartment, if room assignments affect the value, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. If the big room is worth more, the person in it should pay more. However, in this case, the initial assignment was random, and then a switch happened with a side payment. The issue is that the side payment isn't reflected in the overall rent split. So X is paying the same as OP, but OP is getting an extra $30. Therefore, OP is in a better position financially, which is why X is upset. \n\nIs OP in the wrong? If the initial agreement was to assign rooms via random without considering room size, then OP's initial assignment was fair. Then, allowing a switch where Y pays OP $30 is a private agreement, but it creates an imbalance in the rent. However, the standard practice in shared housing is to adjust rent based on room size. If the big room is worth more, the person in it should pay more. Since the original rent was split equally, the person in the big room was getting a better deal. Then, when Y switches in, paying OP $30 on top of the regular rent, that's a way to balance it. However, X is not involved in this, so he feels it's unfair. \n\nThe problem is that the side payment between Y and OP doesn't adjust the base rent. So X is still paying the same as OP, but OP is getting extra money from Y. This creates a disparity where OP is effectively making more money than X, which is why X is upset. Therefore, OP might be in the wrong because the agreement between Y and OP affects the overall fairness of the rent split among all roommates. The correct approach would have been to adjust the rent so that the person in the bigger room pays more, and others pay less. If the rent was adjusted accordingly, then the side payment wouldn't be necessary, and X wouldn't be upset. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the OP is in the wrong because the private agreement between Y and OP created an unfair financial situation for X. The solution should have been to adjust the rent based on room size, not to have a side payment that only involves two roommates and affects the third. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
