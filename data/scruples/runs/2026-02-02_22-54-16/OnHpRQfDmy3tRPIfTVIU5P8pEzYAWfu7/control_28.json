Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates dividing up the bigger bedroom. The apartment has three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, the author wanted the bigger room and decided to use a random number generator to determine who gets it. They did that because when the author suggested a bidding system based on income, Y thought that wasn't fair. So they flipped a coin, or used a random.org, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y asked for the room again because he needed more space for his bed. The author agreed that Y could have the room if he paid $30 extra each month. So, this arrangement was made between the author and Y, and now X is upset because he thinks the author is getting an unfair advantage by paying less rent for a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. When the room was assigned randomly, X wasn't consulted about the process. However, the author and Y later made a private arrangement where Y pays the extra. But since the total rent might be split equally among all three roommates, the author is effectively paying less than X by $30 because of the swap. X feels that he's being treated unfairly.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to negotiate the room swap with Y without X's consent? And is the arrangement fair to X? \n\nIn roommate situations, decisions that affect shared costs or room assignments typically should involve all roommates. If the total rent is divided equally, then changing room assignments without adjusting the overall split could lead to inequity. However, if the rent is split based on room sizes, then the author's arrangement with Y might be fair. But in this case, it seems that the rent was split equally, so the author's payment of $30 less might not be fair to X.\n\nAlso, the initial random assignment was agreed upon by the author and Y, but X might not have been aware or involved in that process. If the initial agreement didn't consider X's input, then later changing the arrangement without including X could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made an arrangement that affects the overall fairness of rent distribution without consulting X first. The fact that X is now paying more in effective rent because of the swap could be seen as unfair, even if the author and Y agreed on the swap. Therefore, the author should have discussed this with X to ensure everyone was on the same page about the rent distribution based on room sizes.\n"
