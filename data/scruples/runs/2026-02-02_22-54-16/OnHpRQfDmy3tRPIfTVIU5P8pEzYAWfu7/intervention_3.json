Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this roommate situation. The scenario is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room. The author initially decided to use a random.org roll to decide, which they won. Then, after Y asked for the room, the author agreed to let Y take it in exchange for Y paying $30 extra. Now X is upset because he's paying the same rent but the author is getting $30 less.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is whether the author's agreement with Y is fair to X. The author and Y made an agreement without X's input. The question is about fairness and whether the author should have included X in the decision-making process.\n\nThe author didn't scam anyone, but maybe violated an unspoken agreement. When they used random.org, they decided that the author would get the big room. Then, when Y wanted it, the author made a deal that affected X's rent. The problem is that X wasn't part of that deal. So even though the author and Y agreed on the $30, X feels like he's being treated unfairly because he's not getting any discount.\n\nIn roommate situations, usually, the rent is split equally unless everyone agrees to a different arrangement. If the author and Y changed the payment without X's consent, X might feel wronged. However, in some cases, roommates might adjust payments based on room size or other factors. But if the original agreement was random, and then a new agreement is made that benefits one roommate at the expense of another, that could create tension.\n\nAnother angle is that the author and Y's agreement might not be valid if it wasn't discussed with X. The initial random selection was between X and Y, but when the author gave up the room to Y, it affected X's share of the rent. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider that their arrangement with Y would create an unequal payment system among all roommates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether the deal between the author and Y was made in a way that affects X without his consent. Since X is paying the same while the author is getting a discount, it's possible that the author should have included X in the discussion. The author's action might be seen as unfair to X, even if the author didn't intend to scam anyone. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the agreement with Y was made without considering X's position and the equal rent distribution.\n"
