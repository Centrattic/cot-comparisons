Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into an apartment with two roommates, X and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Initially, when deciding who gets the big room, the author wanted it and Y also wanted it. The author suggested either randomizing it or letting the highest bidder take it. Y thought the highest bidder wasn't fair because of income differences, so they went with a random.org roll, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y changed his mind and wanted the big room instead. The author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed, but now X is upset, saying the author is scamming him because he's paying $30 less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the initial agreement. The author and Y had a dispute over the big room, which was resolved by a random draw. That seems fair because both wanted the room equally, and a random method was used. Then, when Y asked to switch, the author offered a monetary compensation. Y agreed, so that part was consensual. However, X wasn't involved in that agreement and didn't know about it until later. \n\nX's problem is that he's now paying $30 more than the author. But wait, the original setup was that each roommate's rent was divided equally, right? If the big room is considered part of the shared space, the rent should be split evenly. However, the author and Y made a private agreement where Y pays an extra $30 to the author. That would mean Y is effectively paying the author directly, not the landlord. So, the author's rent from the landlord is lower, but they're getting $30 from Y. \n\nBut the issue is that X isn't involved in this. If the total rent is split equally, then Y is paying the same amount to the landlord but also giving $30 to the author. The author's net cost is less by $30, while X is still paying the same. However, if the original deal was that the big room was allocated via a fair method (the roll), and then Y voluntarily paid the author to take the room, then the author is just receiving a payment from Y. But X isn't part of that agreement, so he might feel shortchanged because the author is getting money from Y instead of him. \n\nBut is it fair for the author to accept that $30 from Y? The author didn't have to agree; they chose to let Y have the room in exchange for a monthly payment. Since the author and Y both wanted the room, the compensation makes sense as a mutual agreement. However, the problem is that X wasn't consulted. If the room's size affects the overall rent division, maybe all roommates should have agreed on a method. The author and Y made a deal without X's input, which could be seen as unfair to X because the rent structure might be based on equal shares. \n\nOn the other hand, the author and Y might have the right to negotiate between themselves. The initial allocation was done via a random draw, so once the author got the room, they could decide to transfer it for money. But if the room's size isn't reflected in the individual rent portions, then the author is essentially profiting from the room's advantage, which could be considered unfair to X. \n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" might be too strong. Scamming usually implies deception or fraud. The author didn't deceive X; they just made an agreement with Y that X wasn't part of. The question is whether the author should have included X in the decision-making process. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common that all parties need to agree on the distribution of spaces and costs. If the author and Y changed the arrangement without consulting X, that could be where the problem lies. X might feel that his share of the rent isn't adjusted, leading to an imbalance. \n\nThe author's response to X's anger would matter too. If the author had informed X about the agreement or ensured that the total rent was adjusted so everyone's contribution was equal, it might be more acceptable. But since the author is taking $30 from Y without involving X, it seems like they're not redistributing the costs properly. \n\nSo, the key points are: the initial allocation was fair, the author and Y had a consensual trade, but the method of compensation might not be fair to X because it's not adjusting the overall rent split. The author is in a position where they're taking advantage of a situation without considering the impact on the third roommate, even if the agreement was between two parties. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing X's potential concerns or ensuring that the rent is divided based on room sizes properly. But it's a bit tricky because the author and Y had their own agreement. However, since the rent to the landlord is divided equally, the author is effectively getting a benefit that the others aren't, which is the $30 from Y. That could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong if they only agreed with Y and the landlord's rent was split equally. The author is not scamming X unless there was an initial agreement that the rent would be divided based on room size. If the original understanding was that rent is split equally, then the author's action with Y is a private agreement that doesn't directly affect X. But if the total rent is divided equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that's a separate transaction. However, X might still feel that the author is being unfair because the room's size should influence the rent. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is paying less in total compared to X. If the big room is 40% larger, maybe the rent should reflect that. If the author and Y agree that the big room is worth $30 more, but the total rent is the same, then the author is effectively getting $30 less from the landlord, which X isn't part of. That could be where the unfairness lies. If the author is supposed to be splitting the rent equally, but is keeping the $30 from Y, then the author is indeed at a disadvantage compared to X. \n\nWait, actually, if the total rent is split equally, and Y is giving the author $30, then Y is paying his equal share plus $30 to the author. So Y is effectively paying more in total, while the author is paying less. But X is paying his equal share. So the author is saving $30, which might be considered unfair because the big room's value isn't being accounted for in the overall rent. If the initial split should have been adjusted for room size, but it wasn't, then the author's agreement with Y is just a way to transfer money between them. \n\nBut since the author and Y decided to randomize the room and then later negotiate, the author might have the right to accept a compensation. However, the problem is that the author is not redistributing the money or involving X in the process. If the author is keeping the $30 from Y to themselves, then X is paying the same as always, and the author is benefiting. That could make X feel like the author is exploiting the situation, especially if the initial agreement to split rent didn't consider room size. \n\nIn many roommate setups, if rooms are different sizes, the rent is split accordingly. If that wasn't the case here, and they just split it equally, then the author and Y making a side deal could be seen as unfair to X. The author is in the wrong because they didn't address the unequal distribution of rent based on room size and didn't involve X in the decision. Even though the agreement with Y was consensual, it's the impact on X that matters here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
