Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms of different sizes. The big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, two roommates, X and Y, were deciding who gets the big room. The author, who I'll call Z, wanted the big room too. They tried to decide by chance, but Y didn't like that because they thought it wasn't fair due to income differences. So they ended up flipping a coin (using random.org) and Z won.\n\nThen three days later, Y came back and wanted the big room because their bed didn't fit. Z offered Y the room if they paid an extra $30/month. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he's in the smaller room and Z is paying less, and he feels Z is scamming him.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the initial agreement was fair. The coin toss seems fair because both Z and Y agreed to it. Then Y changed their mind and wanted the room, so Z made a deal where Y pays extra. But X wasn't part of these negotiations. So maybe the issue is that the original agreement between Z and Y didn't consider X's input, even though he's another roommate.\n\nWait, the original setup had three roommates. But when they decided who gets the big room, it was between Z, Y, and... X? The user's story says they moved in with two acquaintances, so three people total. But when they decided the big room, Z and Y were discussing it. Did X have any say in the initial allocation? The user says that before moving in, Z asked his roommates (X and Y) who was taking the big room. X was indifferent, Y wanted it. So the initial allocation was decided between all three, but X didn't care. Then Z and Y had a coin toss which X wasn't part of? Wait, maybe X didn't care, so they didn't need his input.\n\nThen, when Y wanted to switch, Z offered to let Y take the room if they paid $30 more. The problem is that X now feels that he's paying the same as Z but Z is getting a better room. So maybe the problem is that the room assignments and rent splits aren't equal. Typically, roommates might split the rent equally regardless of room size, but if someone pays extra for the bigger room, that could affect the others' payments. However, in this case, the author Z is paying less, not more, because Y is paying an extra $30. Wait, the author says \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So does that mean Y is paying Z $30, which Z then gives to X? Or is the total rent split as X and Z pay their share, and Y pays Z $30 on top?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. If the total rent is split equally, then each pays a third. If Y is paying Z $30, that might be on top of their own share. So Z is getting $30 from Y, which could be considered as Z giving up the big room for that amount. But then X is paying the same as Z, but Z is in the smaller room, so maybe X isn't affected. Wait, no. If Z is in the smaller room, then maybe X is in the other small room, and Y is in the big one. But the rent split isn't specified. The problem is that X thinks he's paying the same as Z, but Z is in a smaller room and thus should be paying less. But in reality, Z is in the bigger room and Y is in the small one, but Z is paying less because of the $30 arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe the initial rent split was equal. So if the total rent is, say, $X, each pays $X/3. Then when Y takes the big room, they pay an extra $30 to Z. That would mean Y's total is ($X/3) + $30, and Z's is ($X/3) - $30. But X is still paying $X/3. So X feels that Z is getting a better deal (smaller room but paying less) while he's in a similar room but paying the same. But actually, Z is in the big room, and Y is in the small room, but Z is supposed to get the big room. Wait, no. The author says that after the coin toss, Z has the big room, then Y wants it, and Z agrees to let Y have it if they pay $30. So now Y is in the big room, Z is in the small one. But Z gets $30 from Y. So maybe the total rent is still split equally, but Z is receiving $30 from Y. So effectively, Z is getting $30 more than they should, because they moved to a smaller room. But X is still paying the same. So X is in the other small room, Z is in another small room, and Y is in the big one. But Z is getting paid $30 by Y, so maybe the total rent is adjusted. But X might not be aware of this arrangement, or maybe the initial agreement was equal split, and this side deal between Z and Y is causing X to feel unfair.\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, if rooms are different sizes, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. If Z and Y are making a side deal without informing X, that could be problematic. Also, when Y wanted to switch, Z made a deal with Y without consulting X, even though X is also a roommate. The initial decision to assign the big room was between all three, but then the subsequent switch was only between Z and Y. X might feel that since he's not in the big room and paying the same as Z, who is now in a smaller room, the arrangement is unfair. But actually, Z is getting $30 from Y, which might balance things out. The confusion here is whether the side deal between Z and Y affects X's share of the rent. If the total rent is split equally, and Z is receiving $30 from Y, then Z's effective share is lower than X's. So X is paying the same as Z, but Z is getting an extra $30. That's not fair to X because X is paying more in total. Wait, no. Let's break it down numerically. Suppose total rent is $3000/month. Each roommate pays $1000. Then Y pays Z $30 for the big room. So Z's total payment is $1000 - $30 = $970, Y's is $1000 + $30 = $1030, and X pays $1000. So X is paying more than Z but in the same size room. That's the problem. Because X is in a small room, same as Z, but paying more. So this creates an imbalance. The author's arrangement with Y created a situation where X is paying more than Z for the same room. That's why X is upset.\n\nBut is that the author's fault? The author made a deal with Y without considering X's input. The initial allocation of the big room was agreed upon by all three, but the switch was only between Z and Y. The problem is that the side deal affects the rent distribution among all roommates. If the total rent is split equally, then the side payment from Y to Z disrupts the fairness. The correct approach would be to adjust the rent splits based on room size, possibly with everyone's agreement. Since the author didn't involve X in the deal, and the side payment causes X to pay more for the same room, the author is at fault. The author should have made sure the arrangement was fair to all roommates, not just Z and Y. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
