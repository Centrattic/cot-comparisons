Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for arranging a deal with their roommate Y over the bigger room. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the author, Y, and X were roommates. The big room was 40% larger. Initially, the author and Y both wanted it. Y didn't want a bidding war because of income differences, so they flipped a virtual coin (using random.org), and the author won. That seems fair. Then, after three days, Y came back asking for the room in exchange for paying $30/month of the author's rent. The author agreed. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent. X feels the author is scamming him.\n\nSo, was there a fair agreement between Y and the author? The initial allocation was random, which everyone agreed to. Then Y approached the author to negotiate a trade. If X wasn't part of that negotiation, but the original agreement was between the author and Y, then maybe X isn't part of that deal. However, the rent arrangement affects X because the total rent is split. If the author is receiving $30 from Y, that could mean X is effectively paying more. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe key here is whether the author and Y could make a private agreement without X's consent. If the room allocation and rent splitting are mutual agreements between all roommates, then maybe the author should have included X. However, in many roommate situations, once a room is assigned and rent is split equally, a side deal between two roommates could create imbalance. But if X was not part of the $30 deal, he might feel it's unfair that the author's rent is effectively lower. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author didn't scam anyone. They agreed to a fair coin flip, and then Y asked to switch, which the author allowed in exchange for $30. If the agreement was that Y would pay the author $30 to take over the room, and X wasn't part of that, X might be upset because the rent dynamic changes. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because it's a private agreement between two parties. Unless the original agreement required all parties to approve room swaps, the author isn't violating any rules. X's upset is about the financial arrangement affecting the rent split, but if the deal was that Y pays the author, then X might end up paying more collectively. \n\nBut maybe the original rent was split three ways equally. If Y is paying the author $30, the total rent paid by all might not change, but the distribution does. So X is paying his third, the author is getting $30 from Y, so maybe the total is still the same. Wait, no\u2014if the total rent is $X, and each pays a third, but Y pays the author $30, then the author is effectively paying $ (third - $30). But if the original rent was split equally, then the author is getting an unfair advantage. However, unless the room allocation is tied to rent, the author isn't wrong. \n\nThe issue is whether the side deal between author and Y is legitimate. In many cases, roommates can negotiate among themselves, but if it affects the overall fairness, especially if the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then it's a problem. If the author and Y agreed to a private arrangement without X's input, X is justified in feeling upset. But the author isn't \"scamming\" them unless there was a prior agreement that room size doesn't affect rent. If the author and Y made a deal after the initial random allocation, and X was not part of it, the author isn't in the wrong unless the initial terms required all to agree on room swaps. Since the initial agreement was a coin flip between two people who wanted the room, and then a private swap, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But if the room assignment and rent should be decided collectively, then maybe A. But since the author and Y negotiated without X, and X wasn't part of the initial agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B."
