Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. When moving in, the author and roommate Y both wanted the big room. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y asked for the room back, and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, roommate X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent for a smaller room.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and agreements. The initial allocation was decided by a random draw, which seems fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they came to a mutual agreement where Y pays an extra $30. The author isn't taking advantage of X in that agreement because X wasn't part of the negotiation. However, X is now upset because he's paying the same as the author but in a smaller room. \n\nBut wait, the original rent split wasn't specified. If the total rent is divided equally among the three, then the author is effectively paying less per person because they're sharing the cost with two others. However, when Y offers to pay $30 extra, maybe the author is keeping that as a personal gain, which could be seen as unfair to X. But is that the case? If the total rent is fixed, then the author's room is bigger, so maybe they should pay more. But the author isn't paying more; instead, Y is paying the author $30. That might mean the author is getting an unfair advantage over X. \n\nAnother angle: The initial agreement between the author and Y was mutual. Both agreed to the terms, so that's a valid private agreement. However, if the rent is split equally among all three, then the author is effectively getting a bigger room for the same price as X, which could be seen as unfair to X. But if the extra $30 from Y is going towards the author's rent, then the author is paying less than their share, and X is paying more. But the problem is, how was the rent originally split? If it's split equally, then the author's arrangement with Y might be causing X to pay more than his share, which could be the root of X's complaint.\n\nBut the story doesn't specify how the rent was divided. If the total rent is split three ways, and the author is keeping the $30 from Y, then the author is effectively getting a free $30 per month from the arrangement. That would be unfair to X because X is paying the same as the author but in a smaller room, while the author is getting a bigger room and extra money. On the other hand, if the rent was split based on room size, then maybe the initial split was unequal, but the story doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's agreement with Y is fair to X. Since X wasn't part of the agreement, but the arrangement affects his living conditions and possibly the rent split. If the author is effectively paying less rent than X for a bigger room, that's unfair. But if the rent was always split equally regardless of room size, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the initial agreement. However, the fact that the author is getting extra money from Y for the room might mean that the rent isn't being split fairly. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common to split rent based on room size or other factors. If the original agreement was to split rent equally, then the author's arrangement with Y creates an imbalance. X is paying the same as the author but in a smaller room, while the author is getting a bigger room and an extra $30. That would be unfair to X. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their private agreement affects X. \n\nBut the author might argue that they had the right to the room through the random draw and that the agreement with Y was voluntary. However, if the rent isn't adjusted to reflect the room size, then the author is benefiting more than others. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the arrangement leads to an unfair distribution of rent relative to room size, affecting X's share.\n"
