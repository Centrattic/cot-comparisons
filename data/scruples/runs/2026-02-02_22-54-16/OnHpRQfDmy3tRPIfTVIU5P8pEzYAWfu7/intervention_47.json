Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for scamming their roommate. The situation involves three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms, one of which is significantly larger. The initial agreement was to decide who gets the big room via a random selection, which the author won. Then, after a few days, another roommate (Y) asked for the big room and offered to pay $30 extra a month. The author agreed, so Y got the room and the author gave Y $30/month. The third roommate (X) is now upset because he feels the arrangement is unfair since he's in a smaller room and pays the same rent.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the initial agreement. The author and Y had a mutual agreement to use random.org to decide who gets the bigger room. The author won, so that's fair. Then Y approached again and offered to pay $30/month to switch. Both parties agreed, so that's a mutual agreement between Y and the author. The question is whether X has a valid grievance here.\n\nX wasn't part of the initial agreement. The room selection was between the author and Y. However, X is now upset because the arrangement affects the rent distribution. If all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, but Y pays the author $30/month, that could create an imbalance. But maybe the total rent is split equally among all three, and the $30 is an additional payment from Y to the author. In that case, X isn't directly affected because his rent stays the same. However, if the author is effectively paying less total rent by receiving $30 from Y, then X might feel he's paying more than his fair share.\n\nThe key here is whether the initial agreement was inclusive of all roommates. The author and Y decided between themselves without involving X. But X wasn't part of the room selection process initially. However, the fact that X is now upset suggests that maybe the arrangement should have been discussed with all roommates. But the author's argument is that the room selection was between him and Y, and X wasn't interested in the big room initially. \n\nIs there a standard practice for this? Typically, when roommates are splitting rent, larger rooms might be considered worth more, and adjustments are made. If the author and Y negotiated a private agreement without involving X, maybe that's where the issue lies. X might feel that the rent should be adjusted for all, not just between two people. However, if the original agreement was for equal splits, and the $30 is a private exchange between Y and the author, then X might not be directly involved. But if X is paying the same as Y but in a smaller room, then X could feel it's unfair, especially if the total rent isn't adjusted.\n\nAnother angle: The original random selection was fair, but the subsequent switch involved a private arrangement. If the author is now effectively getting a financial benefit from Y, while X remains in a smaller room without compensation, that could be seen as unfair to X. However, if X wasn't part of the initial agreement and didn't want the big room, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the author might be at fault for not including X in the discussion about adjusting rents based on room sizes.\n\nIn many shared housing situations, room assignments and rent splits are usually discussed among all roommates. The author and Y handled it between themselves, which might have been the mistake. By not including X in the initial negotiation about room sizes and potential rent adjustments, the author may have set up a situation where X feels left out and paying more for a smaller space. Even if the author didn't want to adjust the rent, the fact that Y is paying the author an extra $30 could create an imbalance that affects X's perception of fairness.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the initial agreement between Y and the author didn't consider X's situation. The problem arises because the arrangement between the author and Y affects the overall fairness among all three roommates. Even if the author had the right to the big room initially, the subsequent switch without adjusting the rent structure for all roommates could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is at fault).\n"
