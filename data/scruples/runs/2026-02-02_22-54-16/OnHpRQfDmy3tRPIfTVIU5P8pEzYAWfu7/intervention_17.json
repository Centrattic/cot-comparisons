Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for negotiating an extra $30 from their roommate Y to switch rooms. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, they randomly assigned the bigger room through a lottery. The author won, so they had the right to the big room. Then, after three days, Y requested the room again, arguing their needs, and the author set a price for giving it up. Y agreed to pay $30/month. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is charging him extra, even though the author is paying the same as X. But X wasn't part of the agreement. \n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author's agreement with Y affects X. The original arrangement between the author and Y was a private agreement. However, since the rent is split among all three, any additional payment from Y to the author could be seen as an unfair advantage unless it's accounted for in the overall rent split. \n\nWait, but the author is saying that Y pays $30 of the author's rent each month. That means Y effectively pays more total rent than X, even though they're supposed to split the rent equally. If the total rent is divided equally, but one roomate is paying more, that could be an issue. However, in many shared apartments, it's common to have different room prices if the rooms are different in size. But in this case, the original setup was supposed to be a random assignment. The problem arises when the author allowed a private financial arrangement that affects the overall rent distribution without consulting the third roommate. \n\nX is upset because he feels the author is getting an unfair benefit from the arrangement, making him pay more indirectly. If the total rent is split equally, but Y is paying the author $30, then effectively, Y is paying more in total. That could be seen as an unfair redistribution of costs without X's consent. The author might have thought it was a private agreement, but since the rent structure affects all roommates, X's objection is valid. \n\nThe author's mistake was not involving X in the decision when the room sizes and payment structure affect all three. Even if Y and the author agreed on the $30, by taking that money, the author is effectively changing the financial arrangement in a way that impacts X. That's why X feels it's unfair. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering the collective agreement. \n\nBut another angle: if the rooms were assigned by random, and then the author and Y made a deal, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for making a deal they agreed upon. However, if the deal affects the overall rent split among all roommates, then X is justified in feeling wronged. The key is whether the financial arrangement between Y and the author alters the initial agreement between all three roommates. If the original rent split assumed equal sharing, then the author's deal with Y could be seen as a violation of that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't get X's agreement on the financial arrangement, which affects the entire group's rent distribution. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
