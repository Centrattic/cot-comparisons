Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, there were three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. The author wanted the big room, and so did another roommate, Y. The third roommate, X, didn't care. They initially decided to flip a coin (using a random number generator) and the author won. So the author took the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y came back and wanted the big room, arguing they needed more space for their bed. The author offered a deal: Y could have the big room if they paid an extra $30 per month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent for a smaller room. X is accusing the author of scamming him.\n\nThe key points here are whether the original agreement was fair and if the author's subsequent deal with Y affected X's rights. When the author and Y decided the room allocation through a coin flip, X didn't have a problem. The author then made a separate agreement with Y, which Y agreed to. Since X didn't want the big room initially, he didn't participate in the negotiation. \n\nHowever, the problem arises because the total rent is split among three people. If the author is paying less rent because they're letting Y have the big room for an extra $30, that $30 might be part of Y's contribution to the shared rent. This could mean that X is effectively paying more because the author is not contributing their full share. But the original setup didn't specify how the rent was divided. If the rent was split equally, then maybe the author's arrangement with Y is unfair to X. However, if the rent was split based on room size, then the author's deal with Y might adjust that. But the problem is that X didn't agree to this arrangement. \n\nThe author didn't involve X in the negotiations with Y, and the deal between the author and Y might have altered the original rent distribution agreement without X's consent. If the original agreement was to split the rent equally, then the author's deal with Y could be seen as unfair to X because X is now paying more per square meter than the author. That's where X's anger comes from. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made a private agreement that affects X's financial responsibility without his input. The initial coin flip decided the room allocation, but the financial arrangement between the author and Y changed the rent distribution, which X didn't agree to. Therefore, the author should have discussed the financial adjustments with X to maintain fairness in the overall rent split. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all parties agree on how rent is divided, especially if room sizes and associated costs are considered. The author's action of allowing Y to take the big room in exchange for $30/month without considering X's perspective might have disrupted the original agreement, making the author at fault.\n"
