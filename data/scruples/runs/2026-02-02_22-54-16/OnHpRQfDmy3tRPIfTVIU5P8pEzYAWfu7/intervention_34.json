Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves roommates splitting the rent and choosing rooms. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. The author (let's call them Z) moved in with X and Y.\n\nFirst, they had to decide who gets the bigger room. Z wanted it, Y also wanted it. They considered randomizing or bidding. Y argued against bidding because of income inequality, so they went with a random.org roll, and Z won. Then, a few days later, Y wanted the room again, offering to pay $30 extra each month. Z agreed, so Y took the bigger room, and now X is upset because Z is paying less than him for the same room.\n\nSo, the main question is whether Z is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: They decided on a random selection. Z won, so initially, Z had the right to the bigger room. That seems fair. Both agreed to this method.\n\n2. **Y's Request**: After three days, Y changed their mind and wanted to give up their room in exchange for $30 a month. Z agreed. Now, Y is in the bigger room, paying $30 extra. \n\n3. **X's Complaint**: X is upset because Z is paying less rent for the same room. But X didn't participate in the initial agreement about room selection. The original problem was between Z and Y. X didn't express any issue at the time.\n\nBut wait, are all roommates supposed to agree on such arrangements? The apartment is split into three rooms. If the rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the person in the bigger room is getting more for the same price. That's unfair. To balance that, some roommates split rent based on room size or have a system where the bigger room has a higher share.\n\nIn this case, when Y wanted the bigger room, they agreed to pay $30 extra. That makes sense because the bigger room is worth more. However, if X is in a smaller room and paying the same as Z (who is in a bigger room but giving $30 to Y), then X might not realize that Z is effectively paying more in total. Let me see:\n\nOriginal arrangement: All three split the rent equally. Then Y pays Z $30 to swap rooms. Wait, no, Z was in the bigger room, and Y offered to pay Z $30/month to take the room. So Y moves into the bigger room, pays Z $30. But how does that affect the rent? If the total rent is split equally, then all three pay the same. However, Y is giving Z $30 to move into the bigger room. So Z is getting $30 extra from Y, which might offset the cost of the bigger room. But X isn't involved in this arrangement. So X is in a smaller room, paying the same as Y (who is in the bigger room) but Z is getting $30 from Y. So from X's perspective, Z is getting $30 for the bigger room while he's in a smaller room without any compensation. That might make X feel like Z is exploiting the situation.\n\nBut the initial room selection was random. Z had the right to the bigger room, and then Y negotiated a trade. If the room assignment is separate from the rent split, then perhaps Z is not in the wrong. However, if the room size affects the rent distribution, then maybe there should be a different arrangement. The key here is whether the initial agreement between Z and Y was communicated to X. If not, then X might feel left out, especially if the rent isn't adjusted properly.\n\nAnother angle: When Y paid $30 to Z, does that mean Y is effectively paying Z, and the rent is still split equally? If so, then Z is getting extra money, while Y is in the bigger room. However, if the total rent is the same, and the $30 is just between Y and Z, then X is not part of that arrangement. But if X thinks the rent should be split based on room size, then Z's arrangement with Y isn't addressing that. \n\nSo, was Z wrong? If the initial room selection was fair, and the swap was agreed upon, then Z isn't in the wrong. But if X was supposed to be part of the initial room assignment process, maybe there was an oversight. However, the room selection was between Z and Y, and X didn't have a problem until later. So perhaps Z and Y made a private agreement that X wasn't involved in. If the rent structure isn't adjusted for room size, then maybe X is right to be upset because Z is getting an unfair advantage. But if the room swap involved Y compensating Z, maybe the compensation should also involve X.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the original question is from Z's perspective. They agreed to take the bigger room via random.org, then Y wanted to swap and paid Z $30. Now X is upset because Z is in a smaller room and getting $30 from Y, while X is in a smaller room without compensation. But actually, Z was in the bigger room initially, then gave it up for $30. So Z is now in a smaller room but receiving $30 from Y. Meanwhile, Y is in the bigger room. If the rent is split equally, then Y's $30 to Z would mean Y is effectively paying Z more than their share of the rent. Wait, no\u2014if the total rent is split equally, and Y is giving Z $30, then Y is paying Z $30 on top of their own share. That would mean Y is paying more in total. But if the room is bigger, then perhaps Y should be paying more, which they are doing via the $30. But if the rent is split equally, then the $30 is an additional payment. So from X's perspective, Z is getting money from Y without any change in rent. But X is in a smaller room, same as before. \n\nBut the issue is whether Z is in the wrong. The problem arises because the room assignment and the financial arrangement were done without X's knowledge or agreement. If the room selection process was supposed to be between all three, then Z and Y made a decision without X. However, the original question states that only Z and Y were discussing the room selection. X didn't have any input until the problem arose. So maybe Z's agreement with Y is a private matter, and X is upset because he's being treated unfairly. But if the original room selection was fair, then maybe Z isn't in the wrong. However, if the arrangement between Y and Z affects the rent distribution, and X is paying the same as Y, then X might feel that the system is unfair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the room size should have been factored into the rent from the start. If the bigger room is worth more, then the rent should be split accordingly. If the roommates didn't agree to that, then the initial arrangement is unfair. But since they didn't, perhaps the swap with Y paying $30 is a way to balance it. \n\nSo, is Z in the wrong? It depends on whether the room swap was properly communicated and if the rent split is fair. If the room swap is between Y and Z, and X wasn't involved, then maybe Z isn't in the wrong. But if X is being treated unfairly because of the swap, then maybe Z is. However, the problem was between Z and Y, and X had no input. Unless the original agreement required all roommates to agree on room assignments, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nIn many roommate situations, unless everyone agrees on how to split rent based on room size, it's common for the person in the bigger room to pay more. Since Z and Y arranged that Y would pay $30 extra, perhaps that's fair. However, if the rent isn't adjusted, and the $30 is just given to Z as a side deal, then X might not be aware that Z is actually getting compensated. But if the total rent paid by all is the same, and the $30 is just a transfer, then Z is effectively getting more money while Y is paying more. But X is in the same position as before. \n\nThe key point is whether the initial room selection and subsequent swap were done fairly. Since Z won the random draw first, then Y negotiated a swap, and Z agreed. X wasn't part of that. So unless X had a claim to the bigger room or the initial agreement required all three to agree, Z and Y's arrangement stands. Therefore, Z is not in the wrong. However, if the problem is that the rent isn't split based on room size, then maybe the entire setup is flawed, but that's a different issue. \n\nIn conclusion, since Z acted in good faith, followed the initial agreement, and the swap was between Z and Y without affecting X's rent, Z isn't in the wrong. X's anger might stem from not understanding the financial arrangement or feeling left out, but that's more about communication than Z being at fault.\n"
