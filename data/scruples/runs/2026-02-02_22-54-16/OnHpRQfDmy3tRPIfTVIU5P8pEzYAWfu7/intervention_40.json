Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for their roommate situation. The setup is that they moved in with two roommates, X and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, they wanted to decide who gets the big room either by chance or by who pays more. Y didn't want to pay more because they don't earn as much, so they went with a random generator, which the author won. Then, after three days, Y wanted the big room and offered to pay $30 extra each month. The author agreed to let Y have it if they paid that. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. \n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the author's agreement to let Y take the big room in exchange for $30 is fair, and if they should have involved X in the decision. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial decision: the author and Y discussed who gets the big room. X didn't express any need or desire for it, just let it go. The author and Y decided to use a random generator because Y thought paying more wouldn't be fair. The author won, so they took the big room. That seems like a fair process given the information at the time. X didn't protest then, so maybe he was okay with it.\n\nThen, Y comes back after three days and asks if they can switch. The author is also attached to the big room, so they set a price of $30/month for Y to take it. Y agreed. Now, X is upset. The key point here is whether the author's arrangement with Y affects X's rent. If all three roommates split the rent equally, but Y is effectively paying more by giving $30 to the author, then X is paying less. But maybe the original rent was divided based on room sizes. The question doesn't specify how the rent is split. However, the author mentions that the big room is \"rightfully\" theirs, implying that the rent might be split based on room size. But if they agreed to a flat split, the author's arrangement could be a side deal. \n\nBut wait, if the total rent is split equally, but the author is letting Y take the big room by having Y pay an extra $30, that would mean the author is getting $30 less, and Y is paying $30 more on top of their share. But if the official rent is split equally, then X's share isn't actually less in the official payment. The author is just getting an extra $30 from Y. However, X might perceive that the author is getting a better deal because they have the bigger room and effectively pay less. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, initially, the process was fair. The author had the right to the big room after the random draw. Then, when Y wanted it, the author negotiated a transfer. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. The problem is that X is now upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less. So maybe the author should have involved X in the decision from the start. The original agreement between author and Y didn't consider X's input, but X didn't ask for the room initially. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not considering that if they agree to a side deal where Y pays extra to the author, this could affect the perception of fairness among all roommates. Even if the official rent is the same, the author is receiving money from Y, which might seem like an unfair advantage to X. Also, if the apartment's total rent isn't adjusted to account for room sizes, then the side deal could be seen as circumventing the initial agreement. \n\nBut the author's initial agreement was based on Y's objection to paying more. By using a random generator, they avoided the issue of income differences. However, when Y later wanted the room, the author found a way to let them have it without making it about money. But the $30 might not equate to the actual value of the bigger room. Maybe X feels it's unfair because the author is getting a better room for less cost compared to X's smaller room. \n\nThe author's position is that they followed the original process, then allowed Y to take the room with a side agreement. But X wasn't part of that, and now is upset. So the question is whether the author should have involved X in the initial decision about who gets the big room, or if the side deal is acceptable. \n\nIn most roommate situations, room assignments and rent splits should be discussed and agreed upon by all roommates. If the author and Y made a side deal without X's input, that could be the issue. Even if X didn't want the big room initially, the fact that Y is now paying the author might create an imbalance. If the official rent is split equally, but the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, that's not part of the total rent and might not be considered in the initial agreement. However, if the author is just subletting the big room to Y for $30, it's a separate arrangement. \n\nBut in a shared apartment, fairness is often about transparency. If the author had involved X in the initial decision or the subsequent negotiation, maybe X wouldn't be upset. Since X is now upset, the author might have failed to consider that. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their actions, but perhaps in not ensuring all roommates were on board with the arrangement. However, the original process was fair, and X didn't ask for the room. The side deal is between the author and Y, so X might be upset because he's in a smaller room without realizing that the author was assigned it through a fair method. \n\nAlternatively, if the apartment's total rent is split equally, and the big room is considered a better space, the author might have an obligation to split the rent proportionally. But the original problem was Y not wanting to pay more, so the author used the random generator. Then, when Y wanted it later, the author allowed a payment. But if the apartment's total rent isn't adjusted for room sizes, then the side payment is a way to equalize, but X might not like being in a smaller room for the same price. \n\nSo maybe the author isn't in the wrong for making the deal with Y, but should have considered X's feelings or included them in the process. But since X didn't ask for the big room initially, the author might have had the right to assign it through a fair method. The scamming part is if the author is taking advantage, but since Y agreed, it's mutual. X's issue is more about the distribution of value, not a scam. \n\nSo the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. The initial decision was fair, and the side deal is between two parties. X's upset is valid because he's in a smaller room, but the author isn't scamming them unless the arrangement was not transparent or involved deception.\n"
