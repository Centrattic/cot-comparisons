Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The story is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room. Initially, they were going to flip a coin or something, and the writer won. Then the other roommate (Y) wanted it more and offered to pay an extra $30 a month. The third roommate (X) is now upset because the writer is paying less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's fair. When they first moved in, they used random.org to decide who gets the big room. The writer got it. Then Y wanted it and the writer agreed to give it up if Y pays $30 extra. But X didn't have a problem before, only after this agreement. \n\nX's argument is that the writer is scamming him by getting a cheaper rent. But did the writer do anything wrong? They followed through with the initial agreement. The problem is that X feels left out. The original decision was between Y and the writer. X didn't express any interest in the big room earlier. Maybe X feels that the arrangement isn't fair because he's paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting a discount. \n\nBut the original setup was that the big room was decided randomly. Maybe the total rent is split equally among all three, but the big room's extra cost is being covered by Y's $30. So the writer is paying less in total. Is that fair? If the apartment's rent is split equally, but the big room is a separate cost, the writer might have a lower total. But maybe the initial agreement was that everyone's rent is equal, and the writer is now getting an unfair advantage. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether the writer did something wrong. The key points are: Did Y's payment to the writer affect X's rent? If the apartment's total rent is split equally, and the writer is getting money from Y, perhaps the writer is profiting from the arrangement. However, the writer might have given up the big room for that $30, so it's a trade-off between the benefits of the bigger room and the money. \n\nX's anger might stem from not being involved in the decision initially. But the writer and Y made an agreement without him. If the initial decision was between Y and the writer, perhaps X had no claim to the room. However, if X later found out that the room's allocation affects the rent distribution, he might feel cheated. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the correct approach would have been to have all three roommates agree on the room allocation and rent distribution from the start. Since the writer and Y made an agreement without X, and X is now upset, there's a possibility that the writer didn't consider X's perspective. \n\nBut the writer did give up the big room for $30, so maybe the writer isn't scamming but rather making a personal arrangement that benefits both Y and themselves. If X was okay with the initial random assignment, then the problem arises later when the rent distribution changes. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the original rent agreement included any provisions about room sizes. If all three pay the same rent regardless of room size, then the writer's receiving money from Y could be seen as an unfair advantage. However, if the rent was adjusted based on room size and the writer and Y arranged a private agreement, then it's their business. \n\nIn the scenario, the writer didn't mention that the total rent was split equally. If the total rent is split equally, and the writer is getting $30 from Y, the writer's total is higher, but perhaps the writer's share of the apartment's rent is lower. It's a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the writer is paying less in total because Y is giving them $30, which could be seen as the writer effectively paying less than their share. That would mean X is paying more than their fair share of the total rent, leading to his anger. \n\nIn that case, the writer might be in the wrong because the arrangement affects X's share of the rent. The correct approach would have been to adjust the total rent proportionally based on room sizes, perhaps through a room-by-room pricing system. \n\nBut in the scenario, the writer and Y made a side deal without involving X, which might have created an imbalance. So X's argument is valid because the room allocation and the subsequent financial arrangement impact him. The writer should have included X in the discussion to ensure fairness. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the writer is in the wrong) because they made an agreement that affects the third roommate without his consent, leading to an unfair distribution of costs.\n"
