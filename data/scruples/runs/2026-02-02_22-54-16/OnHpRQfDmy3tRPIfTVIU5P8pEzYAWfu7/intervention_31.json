Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. The author, let's call them Z, moved in with X and Y. The big room was decided via a random number generator because Y didn't want to bid due to lower income. Then Y later wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 extra a month for the big room, which Z accepted. Now X is upset because Z is paying less even though X has a similar-sized room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness here. Initially, they used a fair method (random draw) to assign the big room, which Z won. That seems reasonable. Then Y, after getting the big room, wants to switch but Z is charging an amount. But X, who didn't participate in the initial allocation, is now complaining about the price difference. \n\nThe key points are: Did Z and Y have a fair agreement? Was X involved in the initial decision? The original problem was about who wanted the big room. Y wanted it and Z also wanted it. They decided to randomize, so both had an equal chance. When Y later wanted to switch, Z asked for $30/month. Y agreed, so the terms were mutual. \n\nX's complaint is about the rent difference. However, X didn't express interest in the big room initially, so maybe he should have been part of the bidding process. The original agreement between Z and Y was made because X didn't care. Now X feels left out. But the problem is, if X wanted to be part of the decision, he should have spoken up earlier. \n\nAlso, when Y wanted the room, the initial plan was to use a random generator because they didn't want income to be a factor. But then when Y wanted to switch, Z asked for money. But wait, the room was assigned to Z via the random generator. So if Y wants to take it back, Z is entitled to compensation for giving it up. \n\nIs $30 a fair amount? Maybe. If the big room is 40% bigger, the difference in value could be significant. The $30 might be less than the actual market value, but since they were friends and didn't use a formal bidding, maybe they agreed on that as a compromise. \n\nX's argument is that it's unfair because he's paying the same as Z. But X didn't want the big room. The initial allocation was based on Y's desire and a fair method. If X later feels that the rent should be split differently, that's a different issue. But the author isn't scamming; they made a deal with Y. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem fair. They followed through with the initial decision and then agreed on a compensation with Y. X's frustration is about not being involved, but he didn't express interest before. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
