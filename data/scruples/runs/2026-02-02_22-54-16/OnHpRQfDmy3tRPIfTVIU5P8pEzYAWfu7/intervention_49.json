Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for charging a roommate $30 more to get the bigger room. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms. The bigger room is 40% larger. Before moving in, there was a discussion about who gets the big room. Y wanted it, but thought a price would be unfair because of income differences. They agreed to a random draw, which the author won. Then Y changed his mind and offered to pay $30/month for the bigger room. The author agreed, so Y now gets the big room and pays $30 extra. Now X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but getting a smaller room.\n\nThe author's actions: They initially used a fair method (random.org) to decide who gets the big room. When Y wanted to switch, the author charged an extra $30, which Y agreed to. X feels this is unfair.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n1. **Fairness at the start**: The initial decision was random, which seems fair. Y later wanted to change the arrangement, so the author adjusted the price based on Y's request. The author didn't force the price; Y agreed. \n\n2. **X's perspective**: X wasn't involved in the initial decision. He might feel that since he's paying the same as the author but getting a smaller room, it's unfair. However, X wasn't part of the negotiation between the author and Y. If the author and Y made a private agreement, X's complaint might be about not being included in the original decision, not the author's actions now.\n\n3. **Consent and agreement**: The key here is whether the author and Y had a valid agreement. If Y agreed to pay the extra $30, and X wasn't part of that agreement, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the initial random draw was supposed to be the final decision and there was an implicit agreement that the room assignments wouldn't change without mutual consent, then the author might be wrong for allowing the switch without X's input.\n\n4. **Financial implications**: Charging more for the bigger room is a common way to handle different room sizes. If all three had agreed to a price difference upfront, that would be fair. But since the author and Y changed the terms after the initial draw, X's complaint is about the sudden financial disparity. However, the author didn't force the price; Y chose to pay to get the room. \n\n5. **Intent and communication**: The author's intent was to get the bigger room initially, which they did. When Y wanted to switch, the author set a price they both agreed to. The problem arises because X wasn't part of the negotiation. So, maybe the author should have included X in the discussion to maintain fairness among all roommates.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they followed a fair process initially and both parties agreed to the terms when Y wanted to switch. However, X's dissatisfaction stems from not being involved in the decision, which is a valid point. But legally and ethically, if the agreement between the author and Y is valid and X wasn't part of that, the author isn't at fault. The main issue is communication and transparency with all roommates, but the action itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
