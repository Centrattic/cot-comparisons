Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for what they did with their roommate. So the situation is about room assignments and rent splitting. \n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. The author wanted the bigger room and had a discussion with roommates X and Y. Initially, Y wanted it but then the author and Y decided to flip a coin (using random.org) and the author won. Then, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the room, so the author offered to give it to Y if he paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, another roommate X is mad because he thinks the author is getting a better deal, paying $30 less per month for the same square footage. X is upset that the author is \"scamming\" him by getting the bigger room for less rent.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong? Let's look at the rules of room assignments and rent splitting. Typically, when roommates split rent, especially in an unequal setup, the bigger room often commands a higher rent. So if the author won the bigger room through a fair method (the coin flip), they might be expected to pay more. However, in this case, the author initially got the room for free through the coin flip. Then Y later offered $30 to take the room, so the author is now getting $30 from Y. But the problem is that X is upset because he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is in a bigger room but effectively paying less (since the $30 from Y is probably part of the total rent).\n\nWait, maybe the total rent is split three ways. Let me think. If the total rent is, say, $X, then each roommate was supposed to pay a third. But the author is getting $30 from Y, so maybe the author is actually paying less than their share. Wait, if the author is in the bigger room, and Y is in the bigger room but paying $30 to the author, does that mean the total rent is adjusted? Maybe the total rent is fixed, and the $30 is an extra fee paid by Y to the author. But if that's the case, then X's share of the rent is the same as the author's, but the author is in a bigger room and receiving $30 from Y. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as the author for a smaller room, and the author is making money off the bigger room. That seems unfair to X.\n\nBut was there an agreement in place when the author and Y made the $30 deal? The original problem was between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that negotiation. The author and Y decided between themselves how to handle the room change. However, if the total rent isn't adjusted based on room size, then X feels like the author is getting an unfair advantage. But if the original rent split didn't account for room size, maybe that's where the issue arises. The author and Y changed their arrangement without considering the impact on X's share.\n\nSo, the core of the issue is whether the author's arrangement with Y affects the fairness of the overall rent split. If the three roommates didn't agree on a method to adjust rent based on room size, then the author and Y's private arrangement might be seen as creating an imbalance. The author is in a bigger room but paying less than X, who is in a smaller room. X feels this is unfair because the rent isn't adjusted for room size. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that the coin flip decided the initial room assignment, and then Y's offer to pay $30 was a voluntary agreement. The author isn't necessarily taking advantage if the total rent structure wasn't set up with room size in mind. But X is upset because he's not part of that agreement and now feels the rent division is unfair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the initial agreement. If the three roommates didn't agree on a system where room size affects rent, then the author and Y's arrangement could be seen as creating an unfair situation for X. However, if X was okay with the initial setup and the coin flip, then maybe the author isn't wrong. But X is now upset because the author is in a bigger room for less. \n\nAnother angle: when the author agreed to Y paying $30 to switch rooms, maybe the author should have informed X and adjusted the rent so that the total each person pays reflects their room size. If the author kept the $30 and didn't share it or adjust the rent, that might be seen as unfair to X. But if the $30 is part of the rent structure, maybe the total remains the same. For example, if the total rent is $900, each would normally pay $300. But if Y pays the author $30, then Y is effectively paying $330, the author $270, and X $300. That would make X's share higher than the author's, which is unfair if the rooms are different sizes. Wait, maybe the author is paying less than X because of the $30, but the author is in a bigger room. So X is paying more for a smaller room, which he finds unfair.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the overall fairness to X. Even though the arrangement was between the author and Y, it created an imbalance in the total rent paid by each roommate relative to their room size. The author should have either adjusted the rent so that everyone's payment reflects their room's size or included X in the discussion. By not doing so, the author is indirectly causing X to pay more for a smaller room, which X perceives as unfair. Thus, the author might be at fault for not addressing the overall rent distribution and for not involving X in the arrangement, even if the initial agreement was between two people."
