Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for scamming their roommate.\n\nSo, the setup is three people moving into an apartment with three rooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, Roommate Y wants the big room, and the author also wants it. They decide to flip a coin or use a random generator, and the author wins. Then, after three days, Y comes back and wants the room, offering to pay $30/month extra. The author agrees, so Y gets the big room and pays $30 more to the author each month.\n\nNow, Roommate X is upset because he's paying the same rent as Y but in a smaller room. X is angry, saying the author is scamming him.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to enter into that agreement with Y? When they initially decided to randomize, the author got the big room. Then Y offered to pay for it. If the original agreement was that the big room was to be allocated by chance, maybe the author's decision to transfer it for money wasn't fair to X. But if the original agreement allowed for negotiation after the fact, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut here's the thing: when they first decided to randomize, it's possible that all three roommates agreed to that method. If that's the case, the author had a right to the room after winning the random draw. Then, the author and Y made a separate agreement where Y pays $30/month to swap rooms. If the agreement wasn't with X, and the rent is split equally among all three, then X is paying the same as Y but getting a smaller room. That's unfair from X's perspective. The author is effectively getting $30/month from Y without adjusting the rent among all roommates, so X is subsidizing the deal. \n\nBut if the original agreement was only about who gets the room, not about rent, then maybe the author is within their rights to accept money from Y. However, since the total rent is the same, and X is not part of the agreement, it's causing an imbalance. The author should have involved X in the rent adjustment to be fair. Alternatively, if the total rent is divided equally regardless of room size, the author's agreement with Y creates a disparity. So X's complaint is valid because the arrangement affects his share.\n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the author should have adjusted the rent for all roommates or made it clear that the additional $30 from Y would be distributed or adjusted the overall rent split. Since the author is taking $30 from Y but not adjusting X's share, X is effectively paying more for a smaller room. So the author is at fault for not considering X in the agreement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
