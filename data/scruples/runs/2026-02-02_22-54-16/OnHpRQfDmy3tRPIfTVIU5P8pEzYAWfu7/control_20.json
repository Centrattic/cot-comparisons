Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for what they consider \"scamming\" their roommate. So, the situation is about room assignments in an apartment. There are three roommates, and the big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the author wanted the big room and asked who else wanted it. Roommate X didn't care, and Y really wanted it. The author proposed either a random draw or a bidding system where the person who pays more gets the room. Y thought the bidding wasn't fair because the author has a higher income, so they agreed to a random.org draw, which the author won.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed their mind and asked the author to give up the room if Y pays $30 extra each month. The author agreed, and now X is upset because the author is paying less rent for the same-sized room as X, even though the big room was assigned via a draw. X feels the author is scamming him by not involving him in the arrangement. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the initial agreement between the author and Y was fair and if the author had the right to transfer the room. The author and Y made a separate agreement after the initial draw. The problem is whether the author should have considered X in this deal. Since the original draw was between all three, but the deal to switch rooms was only between the author and Y, X might feel left out. However, the author might argue that they had the right to assign the room since they won it. \n\nRoommate agreements can get tricky. Typically, if one person wins a room in a random draw, they can't unilaterally transfer it without consent from all involved, especially if it affects the rent distribution. The author and Y made a deal that changed the rent, which might affect X's perception of fairness because now the rent isn't split equally. X might be upset that the author is paying less, even though the room size is the same, leading to a feeling that the author is getting an unfair advantage. \n\nBut the author didn't force the deal. Y came to them and offered $30 a month in exchange for the room. The author might not have realized that X would be involved in the rent calculation. If the apartment's rent structure was such that each roommate's share is based on room size, then the author's room is bigger, so maybe they should have adjusted the rent accordingly. But in this case, the author was paying less rent than X and Y for the same room? Wait, no, the big room was assigned to the author initially. Then Y took the big room by paying the author $30. So the author is paying less because they transferred the big room to Y? Or is the total rent split in a way that the author is getting money from Y, thereby reducing their own share? That part is a bit unclear. \n\nThe user says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is giving up the big room and instead, Y is taking it and paying $30 extra. But if the total rent for the apartment is fixed, and the author is getting $30 from Y each month, maybe the author is effectively paying less of the overall rent, while Y is covering the difference. But X's rent might have been divided equally before. Now, since Y is paying an additional $30 to the author, perhaps the author is transferring that money, which might mean they're still paying the same as before, but Y is paying more. \n\nWait, the user says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is giving up their right to the big room, and Y is paying $30 to the author each month. But if the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author is giving up the big room and getting $30 from Y, which might not actually compensate for the value of the big room. \n\nBut the key point is that the author and Y made a private agreement after a fair draw. X wasn't part of that agreement. X's issue is that the author is now in a smaller room but gets $30 from Y, which might mean the author's actual rent out of pocket is less. However, if the total rent is split equally, and the author is receiving money from Y, that might be a problem. Because the total rent that the apartment pays is fixed. If each roommate is paying the same, but the author is getting $30 from Y, that would mean the author is effectively paying less of the total cost. \n\nBut in reality, if the apartment's total rent is $X per month, and each roommate is supposed to pay $X/3, then if Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, the author would be getting $30 from Y, but they're still paying $X/3 - $30? Or is the author's share being adjusted? The scenario is a bit unclear. \n\nIf the author and Y made a deal where Y gives $30 to the author, but the actual rent split by the landlord is still equal, then the author is effectively getting a side payment from Y, which could be seen as unfair to X. Because X is paying the same as the author, but the author is receiving money from Y, which might mean the author is not contributing their fair share to the apartment's total rent. \n\nAlternatively, if the total rent split among the three is adjusted so that the person in the bigger room pays more, then maybe the original draw was to determine who gets the big room, and then the author and Y arranged a side payment. But if X was part of the initial agreement to split the rent equally based on room size, but the author and Y changed it without involving X, that could be the problem. \n\nThe initial setup says that the apartment has three bedrooms, with the big one being 40% bigger. The original question was about who would take the big room, and the author and Y decided via a draw. Now, after the author gives the big room to Y for $30, if the rent split is supposed to be based on room size, then Y should be paying more for the bigger room. But if all three are paying the same amount, then the author is in the small room but getting $30 from Y, which could be seen as profiting from the deal while X is still paying the same. \n\nHowever, the user's post says that the big room is \"now rightfully mine for the taking\" because they won the draw. Then, when Y comes back and asks to switch, the author sets a price for giving up the room. If the original agreement was a random draw, and the author and Y later decided to switch with a side payment, but didn't involve X in that arrangement, then X is right to be upset because their own share of the rent might be affected. \n\nIn roommate situations, any changes to the room assignments that affect the rent should ideally include all parties to maintain fairness. The author and Y made a private agreement, which might have altered the rent distribution without consulting X. Therefore, X feels that the author is getting an unfair advantage, which could be valid if the overall rent isn't adjusted properly. \n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The author didn't force Y to offer the money; Y approached them. However, the author might have a responsibility to inform X about the arrangement so that the overall rent split is fair. If the apartment's total rent is split equally, and the author is now in a smaller room but still paying the same as X, but also receiving $30 from Y, that would mean the author is effectively making a profit, which X might not be part of. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the side payment between the author and Y was done in a way that affects the overall rent split for the apartment. If the total rent remains the same and the author is keeping the $30, that's unfair to X. But if the total rent is adjusted to reflect the room sizes, then maybe the author and Y's arrangement is separate. \n\nThe problem is that the user didn't mention whether the apartment's total rent was split based on room size or equally. If it's equally, then the author receiving $30 from Y could be a problem. If it's split by room size, then maybe the author's original share was less, and after giving up the big room, they are now in an equal position with X. \n\nBut the user's statement says that X is upset because the author and X have the same room size, but the author is paying $30 less. That suggests that the total rent is split equally, and the author is not actually paying $30 less to the landlord, but getting $30 from Y. If the apartment's rent is split equally, then the author is still paying the same amount as X, but Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, which might be a problem because the author is keeping that money, making it seem like they're being paid to move out. \n\nIn many roommate agreements, when you switch rooms, the rent is adjusted accordingly. If the big room is 40% larger, maybe the person in the big room pays a larger share. If the original agreement was a random draw to assign the big room, but then the author and Y switch without adjusting the overall rent, that could be an issue. \n\nSo the user might be at fault for not involving X in the decision to transfer the big room and adjust the rent. Even though Y approached them, the fact that the arrangement affects the rent distribution among all three roommates means that X's consent or at least awareness is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a private agreement that affects the overall fairness of rent distribution among all three roommates without consulting X. The side payment might not be transparent to the landlord or to X, leading to an inequitable split. The initial random draw was a fair method, but once the author gives up the room to Y, the rent structure should be adjusted with all parties involved. By taking $30 from Y without involving X, the author is creating a disparity in how the rent is handled, which is unfair to X.\n"
