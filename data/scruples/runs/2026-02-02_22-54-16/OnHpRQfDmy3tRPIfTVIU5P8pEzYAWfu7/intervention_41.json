Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for charging a roommate to switch rooms. So, three roommates: X, Y, and the author. They moved into an apartment with three bedrooms, one of which is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asked who wants the big room. Y really wants it, the author does too. They discuss options: random draw or highest bidder. Y says it's unfair because they have lower income, so they go with the random.org draw, and the author wins.\n\nThen three days later, Y comes back and wants the big room, offers to pay $30 a month for it. The author agrees, so Y takes the big room and pays the author $30 extra. Now X is upset because he's in the same size room as the author but pays $30 more. X thinks the author is scamming him by getting a better deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the initial arrangement. The author and Y agreed on the lottery, which the author won. Then, Y wants to switch and offers money. The author sets a price, and Y agrees. So the agreement is between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nNow, X is upset because he's paying more. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by charging Y and thus reducing their own rent. The key here is whether the initial agreement (lottery) was fair and if the subsequent payment was done transparently. \n\nIn shared housing, room assignments can be tricky. If the room sizes differ, it's common to adjust rent accordingly. But in this case, the author and Y came to a private agreement without involving X. X feels left out and unfair because he ends up paying more than the author. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything to X. The arrangement was between two roommates. X is in the same situation as before, just the other two have a side deal. The problem is that the author didn't involve X in the decision, making him feel excluded. However, unless the original arrangement required consensus (which it didn't, since they used a random draw), the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a lack of transparency. If the room assignments and rent adjustments aren't discussed with all roommates, it could lead to conflicts. However, the agreement was between the author and Y. X's complaint is about the outcome, not the process. \n\nSo, the author isn't scamming anyone. They followed through with the initial agreement and then made a deal with Y. The issue is that X wasn't part of the negotiation, leading to his dissatisfaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better by including X in the discussion about room assignments and rent adjustments.\n"
