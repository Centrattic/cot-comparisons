Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a roommate situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author moved in with two roommates, X and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author also wanted it. They decided to flip a coin via random.org, and the author won. Then three days later, Y came back and said they needed the big room for their bed. The author agreed that Y could take it if they paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting $30 less. X thinks the author is scamming them.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Initially, there was a random selection, which seems fair. Then, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the room. The author offered a trade: Y pays $30/mo to get the room. Y agreed. So the author is now in the smaller room but gets a discount. X is upset because he's not part of this agreement and feels the author is getting a better deal. But wait, X didn't seem to care initially. The author didn't ask X about the arrangement with Y. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to make a private agreement with Y without involving X? When they randomized the room selection, did that make the author's allocation of the big room final, or was it possible to negotiate later? Also, is it fair that Y can pay more to switch rooms, making the author's rent lower than X's?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe X feels that the initial agreement was a one-time random selection, and then allowing a paid switch creates an imbalance. But if the room assignment is based on value, then maybe the bigger room should cost more. However, the original setup didn't specify that. The author and Y decided to have a monthly payment for the room. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. So X might feel excluded and that the arrangement is unfair to him.\n\nBut the author didn't do anything illegal. It's a private agreement between roommates. However, if all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, and the author is getting a discount for being in a smaller room, but X isn't involved, then X's rent is higher relative to the author's. That could be seen as unfair, especially if X didn't agree to the payment structure.\n\nBut maybe the original agreement was that the room assignments were equal in terms of rent, but the author and Y adjusted it between themselves. X wasn't part of that, so he feels left out. The author didn't scam them in a legal sense, but maybe ethically, they should have involved X in the agreement. But the problem is that X didn't care initially. The author might think that since X didn't care about the room, they only needed to negotiate with Y.\n\nAlternatively, since the room assignment affects the rent distribution, maybe all three should be part of any agreement. If the author and Y adjusted the rent between themselves, it creates a disparity that affects X. So X's argument is that the author is getting a better deal, which is unfair to him. The author might not be in the wrong, but maybe they could have handled it differently by involving X in the agreement.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author should have included X in the agreement. If the author didn't, then X's complaint is valid. But since the author didn't initiate the payment agreement with X and only with Y, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the fact that X is now paying more than the author because of the agreement might be seen as unfair. The author isn't scamming, but maybe the process was flawed.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to handle the room assignment fairly and then made a private agreement with Y. However, they might have been better off involving X in the discussion to avoid future issues. But technically, they didn't do anything wrong.\n"
