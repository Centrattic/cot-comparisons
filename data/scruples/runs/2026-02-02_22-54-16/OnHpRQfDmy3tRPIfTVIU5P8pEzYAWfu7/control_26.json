Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. The author moved in with two people, X and Y. The big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, Y wanted the big room, and the author also did. They decided to flip a coin (using a random number generator) and the author won. Then Y asked if they could swap, but wanted to negotiate. The author agreed to take $30 less rent if Y took the big room. Now X is upset because he's in the same size room as Y but the author is paying less, and he thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. Initially, they used a random method to decide who gets the big room. The author won, so they had the right to it. Then Y came in and wanted to switch, but the author set a condition for giving it up: receiving $30 less. So Y is paying $30 extra to have the bigger room, while X is in the same size as Y but not getting a discount. X feels that this is unfair because he's in the same room as Y but the author is effectively getting a lower rent.\n\nWait, but the setup is there are three bedrooms: two smaller ones and one bigger. So the author was in the bigger room after the random draw. Then Y wanted to switch, so the author and Y made a deal where Y pays $30 more each month to take the big room. But X is in a smaller room, and he's comparing his room to Y's, which is the same size as Y's original. So after the swap, X is in a small room, Y is in the big one, and the author is now in another small one. But the author's rent was adjusted down by $30, so X's rent might be the same as before, but Y is paying the original plus $30. So X is now in a smaller room but his rent hasn't changed? Or does the rent split change?\n\nI think the initial arrangement was that all three split the total rent. The big room was allocated by chance, but then the author gave it up for a discount. So the total rent is fixed. Let's say total rent is $1500. If each was supposed to pay $500, but the author now pays $470 and Y pays $530, then X is still paying $500 for his smaller room. That would make X feel like Y is paying more than him for the same size room, which is unfair. But the author is only getting the discount because they gave up the big room. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when the author agreed to take $30 less, they didn't account for the fact that X was in a similar situation. If the author and Y made a private agreement to adjust their rent, but X's rent wasn't changed, then it's possible that the total rent per person isn't equal anymore. However, if the total rent is divided equally among all three, but Y is paying $30 more to the author, that would mean the author is effectively getting a discount. But X's share would still be $500, while Y is paying $530 and the author $470. If the apartment's total rent is fixed, then the author is getting a personal discount, which X might not like. But is that fair?\n\nThe key here is whether the room allocation and rent splitting were properly managed. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, maybe X's rent should also be adjusted. But X didn't ask for the big room initially. The author only had to negotiate with Y because Y wanted the room. The initial randomization was between the author and Y, who both wanted it. X didn't express interest, so maybe their room was just the third one. However, when the author gives up the big room, X is now in a small room, but his rent isn't adjusted. So X might be paying the same as before, even though he's in a smaller room than the person who is paying more. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't involve X in the negotiation. The author and Y made a private agreement that affects the rent distribution. If the roommates are splitting the rent equally based on the apartment's total cost, then the fact that Y is effectively paying more for a bigger room is okay. But if the author is taking $30 from Y and keeping it, that's not the usual way roommates split rent. Typically, if you want to compensate for room sizes, the total rent is split unequally. So if the author was paying $500 for the big room and then Y offers $530 for it, the author would get $30 extra, but that $30 should be part of the overall split. Instead, the author is taking $30 off their own rent, which might mean that the total rent paid by all three is now $1500 minus $30, which isn't right. That could be the issue. \n\nIf the author is reducing their own share, then the total rent isn't being covered properly. The author should only adjust the rent if the total is still the same. So maybe the $30 should be passed on to X, so that the total remains the same. If Y pays $30 extra, then the author and X could each get $15 more. But the author didn't do that; they kept the $30. So X is in a smaller room but his rent isn't adjusted. That's why he's upset. \n\nIn that case, the author made a mistake by not involving X in the negotiation. The $30 should have been used to adjust the rent for the other roommates, not just the author's. By only taking $30 from Y and not redistributing it, the author is essentially benefiting from Y's higher payment, leading to an unequal split in terms of room size and actual rent paid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for X's situation when making the deal. The correct approach would have been to either adjust the rent for everyone or have a system where the total rent is properly split based on room sizes. So the answer is A.\n"
