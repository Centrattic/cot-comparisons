Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their actions regarding the apartment room arrangement.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author moved in with two roommates, X and Y. There are three bedrooms, one being significantly larger. Before moving in, the author and Y discussed who would get the big room. Y wanted it but thought a bid might be unfair due to income differences. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org), and the author won. However, after three days, Y changed his mind and offered to pay $30/month for the big room. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays an extra $30, while X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here. The initial agreement was a random selection between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that decision. When Y wanted to swap, they made a private agreement. X feels left out and that the author is scamming him by getting a better deal. \n\nI need to assess if there's a breach of agreement or fairness. The author and Y made a mutual agreement after the initial random selection. Since X didn't participate in the initial decision and wasn't part of the subsequent agreement, perhaps there's an issue in transparency. However, the author didn't make any agreements with X about the room distribution. \n\nIs there an implicit agreement among all roommates about equal rent or room allocation? The problem is that the apartment's rent is split equally, but the rooms aren't equal in size. By allowing Y to pay an extra $30 to get the bigger room, the author is effectively making the rent split unequal. However, since the original agreement between the author and Y was mutual and X wasn't involved, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut X's argument is that he's being treated unfairly. The issue here might be about fairness and communication. The author didn't involve X in the initial decision or the swap. If the roommates had agreed on a system where everyone could bid for rooms or have equal input, then the author's actions might be problematic. However, since the author and Y made their own arrangement without X's consent, X's complaint is valid because he's not part of the decision-making process. \n\nBut in typical roommate situations, unless there's a prior agreement, each person can choose their room. However, when one person starts charging another for a room, that could be seen as altering the original agreement without consensus. The problem here is that the initial agreement (coin flip) only involved the author and Y. X wasn't part of that. By allowing Y to take the room with a payment, the author is changing the terms without X's input. \n\nSo, maybe the author is at fault for not considering the broader implications on X. Even though the author and Y agreed on the swap, it affects X's rent distribution. If the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author is effectively profiting $30 more than X, which could be seen as unfair. Alternatively, if the $30 is part of the total rent, maybe the author isn't profiting but rather adjusting the rent based on the room's size. However, the problem is that X wasn't involved in that adjustment. \n\nIn many shared housing situations, any additional charges or room swaps should be agreed upon by all parties. Since X wasn't part of the initial agreement and is now affected by the change, the author should have included X in the discussion. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision-making process, leading to an unequal distribution of costs without everyone's consent.\n"
