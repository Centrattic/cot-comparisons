Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their situation with the roommate. So, the setup is that three people moved into an apartment together. The author, X, and Y. The apartment has three rooms\u2014two small and one big. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author also wanted it, so they decided to randomize it, and the author won. Then after three days, Y asked to switch, and the author agreed to take $30 less rent in exchange for the big room, so Y could have it. Now X is mad because he thinks the author is scamming him by paying less rent when they have the same size room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about fairness and agreements between roommates. When they moved in, the big room was decided randomly. Then Y wanted to switch, and the author made a deal with Y where Y pays $30 extra to the author each month. That seems like a private agreement between the author and Y. But X is upset because he feels he wasn't included in this decision and now the author is getting a cheaper rent. \n\nIs the author required to involve X in this? Well, the room assignments and rent splits can vary depending on local laws and the lease agreement. If the lease is split equally among all three, but the author is effectively getting $30 less because they're charging Y extra, that might create an unequal financial situation. If the lease states that each roommate pays an equal share, then the author's arrangement with Y could be considered unfair because X is paying the same but the author is receiving more money, which might be seen as exploiting the situation.\n\nHowever, if the original agreement allowed for room-specific pricing or if the room sizes were considered in the rent division, maybe the author's arrangement is unfair. The original decision was to randomize the big room, and then Y paid the author to switch. The problem arises because the author is keeping the $30 from Y, which affects their own rent payment to X, potentially creating an imbalance in what each roommate is paying. If the total rent is split equally, but the author is effectively getting a discount, that's not fair to X.\n\nAnother angle: roommates typically should all agree on any arrangements. The author made a deal with Y without consulting X, which might be the main issue. Even if the author and Y thought it was fair, X's perspective is that he's paying the same as the others but the author is getting a financial benefit. So the author's action of taking money from Y to switch rooms might be seen as creating an unequal situation without the consent of the third roommate.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" might be harsh, but X's argument is about fairness in rent distribution. The author's arrangement could be considered a side deal that's not transparent to all parties, which can cause conflict. In roommate situations, any financial agreements that affect the overall split should involve all roommates to prevent disputes.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision, leading to an unequal financial arrangement that affects X. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
