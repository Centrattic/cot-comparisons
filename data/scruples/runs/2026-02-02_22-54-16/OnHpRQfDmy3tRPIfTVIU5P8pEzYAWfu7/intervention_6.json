Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. \n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger. The author, X, and Y. Before moving in, the author asks who wants the big room. X says they don't care, Y wants it. The author wanted it too and suggested a random draw or a bidding system. Y thought bidding was unfair because they don't have as high an income, so they did the random.org draw, and the author won.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed their mind and offered to pay $30/month to the author to switch. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays the author $30/month. X is upset because he feels the author is charging him $30 less rent, which he thinks is unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants others' opinions.\n\nLet me break this down. The initial agreement: the room was decided via a random draw, which both Y and the author agreed to. Then, after a short time, Y wanted the room and offered to pay. The author accepted. So the agreement was made between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that agreement. X is now upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting $30 extra. \n\nBut the problem is, when they moved in, there was no clear agreement on how to handle the rent differences. The original rent split might have been equal, not accounting for different room sizes. The author and Y made a private agreement where the author gets $30/month from Y for the room, but X isn't part of that. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as the author, but the author is effectively getting a discount. \n\nIs it fair for the author to charge Y for the room? Well, if they all split the rent equally, the bigger room might be worth more. If the author took the big room, they might have been getting more value. But since they allowed Y to take it and pay $30, maybe that's a way to balance it. However, since the overall rent isn't adjusted, X isn't paying more than the others. The author is receiving $30 from Y, which might be seen as personal profit, not part of the total rent. \n\nBut X is upset because he feels it's unfair. The original allocation was via random.org, which both the author and Y agreed to. The author then allowed Y to switch by paying. The problem is that the author's income from Y isn't part of the shared rent, so X isn't receiving anything. \n\nIs the author violating any initial agreements? The initial agreement was about room assignment, not rent. So if the author and Y made a separate agreement where Y pays the author, that's a private arrangement. However, if the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author is essentially getting an extra $30/month without adjusting the total rent, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut maybe the original rent split wasn't adjusted for room sizes. If all three paid the same, the author was getting a better room. Now, Y is paying the author to have the better room, so effectively, the author is giving up that benefit to Y for $30. However, if the author was already getting a benefit (the bigger room) for free, then allowing Y to take it and pay $30 is a fair exchange. \n\nBut X is upset because he feels the author is profiting. The author isn't necessarily scamming, but maybe didn't consider that the rent structure should be adjusted. The original problem is that the room allocation was decided by the author and Y, without X's input. X might feel that the room allocation should have been discussed with all three people. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author and Y decided on a private agreement without involving X, maybe that's part of the issue. The author might have assumed that since X didn't care, they could make their own deal. But X's complaint is about the rent difference. If the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that's an extra amount not shared with X, which might make the author seem to be in a better position. \n\nBut perhaps the author is just transferring the value of the bigger room from themselves to Y. Since the author was using the bigger room for free before, allowing Y to take it and pay $30 is a fair way to compensate. However, if the original rent didn't account for room sizes, then the author was already getting a benefit. Now, by letting Y take the room, the author is giving up that benefit and charging Y for it. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author should have involved X in the initial room allocation. If X had been part of the decision, maybe he would have a different perspective. But the author and Y decided via random draw, and X didn't object. Then later, Y wanted to switch and paid. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were based on mutual agreement with Y, but X is upset because he feels left out. The author isn't scamming but perhaps didn't consider the implications on the rent structure. If the author had adjusted the rent to account for room sizes, maybe it would be fairer. However, the author's arrangement with Y is a private one, so maybe they are not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the agreement was made between the author and Y, and there's no indication of fraud or deception. However, the author might not have considered X's perspective, but that doesn't make them at fault. The main issue is the rent split, which might not be adjusted for room sizes, but the author's action was based on an agreement with Y.\n"
