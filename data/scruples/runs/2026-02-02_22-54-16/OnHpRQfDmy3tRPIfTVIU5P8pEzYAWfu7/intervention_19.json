Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they did something wrong by letting their roommate Y take the bigger room in exchange for paying $30 less in rent, after a random selection. The roommates X is upset because he feels it's unfair that he's paying the same while the author is getting a cheaper room. \n\nFirst, the initial arrangement: the author and Y wanted the big room, and since they didn't agree on who gets it, they used a random generator. The author won. So, they had a fair method to choose. Then, after three days, Y asked to switch, maybe because of a personal issue (like the bed size). The author proposed a deal where Y would pay $30 extra, and the author would take less. Y agreed.\n\nNow, X is mad because he feels left out. The problem here is whether the author should have involved X in that negotiation. The original agreement was between the author and Y, using a random method. When Y wanted to switch, the author and Y made a private deal without consulting X. If the room assignment and rent were part of a shared agreement, maybe all roommates should have been involved. But if the rent split wasn't based on room size (like they all pay the same share), then the author and Y's arrangement might be separate. \n\nBut sharing an apartment with roommates usually involves some sort of agreement on how rent is divided. If the original plan was to split rent equally, but the author is now effectively paying less, X might feel that the rent distribution isn't fair anymore. The author's deal with Y could be seen as altering the original terms unilaterally without considering X's input. However, the author might argue that they had the right to the room and could negotiate a switch with Y, as long as it's agreed upon and doesn't affect X's rent. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to the big room, and was the deal with Y transparent to X? If the author and Y could adjust their rent split without affecting X, and if X wasn't part of the original agreement, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the overall rent is split equally, and the author is now paying less, that could be a problem. However, the author didn't take the money from X; they just took less from Y. \n\nX's argument is about fairness in rent based on room size. If the author is paying less than the others, maybe because Y is compensating them, then X is paying more relative to the room size. But if the total rent each person pays (including the $30 from Y) is still the same, then it's not an issue. The confusion might be in how the rent is divided. \n\nIn many roommate situations, especially with different room sizes, it's common for the rent to be split unevenly. The author initially got the big room through a fair method, then Y took it by paying the author. If the author is not profiting from this but just receiving compensation, maybe it's okay. But if the author is now paying less than the others, and the original agreement was to split equally, that might be where the problem lies. \n\nSo, if the author and Y adjusted their individual payments without involving X, and that adjustment affects the overall rent distribution among all roommates, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the total amount each person pays to the landlord is the same (Y gives $30 to the author, so everyone still pays the same to the landlord), then it's a private arrangement between the author and Y. In that case, the author isn't scamming X because the deal is between them and Y. But if the author's share is actually less, and X is still paying the same, then X is effectively subsidizing the big room for Y, which is unfair. \n\nThe answer depends on how the rent is structured. If the author's deal with Y results in the author paying less to the landlord, then X is paying more than the author, which could be seen as unfair. But if the author and Y are both paying the same total amount (with Y giving the author $30), then it's a fair exchange. The user didn't specify if the overall rent per person is equal. If the original rent was split equally among three, and Y is now effectively paying more (since he gives $30 to the author), then maybe the author is in the wrong. Wait, no: if the author is getting $30 from Y, their effective payment is equal. Suppose total monthly rent is $1000. Originally, each paid $333. After the deal, the author pays $303 and Y pays $333, but Y gives $30 to the author, so Y's total is $363 and the author's is $303, but they split the $1000. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the author is not paying the landlord less. It's more likely that the author and Y agreed that Y would cover the author's $30 of their own rent. So if the author's total to the landlord is still the same, but Y is paying that $30 on their behalf, then the author isn't paying less compared to Y. But if the original arrangement was that each pays their own share, then the author might be getting a discount for the bigger room. \n\nThe user's original question is whether they are in the wrong. The key is whether the deal with Y was done in good faith and without affecting X's agreement. If the author and Y can adjust their rent split privately, then it's okay. But if the author is now not contributing their fair share to the landlord, thereby making X pay more, that's a problem. The user says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is giving up the room in exchange for $30. The author's monthly payment to the landlord is then reduced by $30, and Y pays the same amount. So if originally, each paid $X, now the author pays $X-30 and Y pays $X. But X is still paying $X. Therefore, X is effectively paying more per person than Y and the author. That's unfair because the rooms are different sizes. \n\nWait, but the author and Y had a private agreement. The problem is that the rent split wasn't based on room size initially. The author might have been in the wrong if their original agreement was to split rent equally, and by giving up the room, they are allowing Y to take it without proper compensation to the landlord. But if the author is not paying the landlord less, but Y is covering the author's $30, then the total rent remains the same. But if the author is now not paying their full share, then X is paying more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author and Y adjusted their rent so that Y pays more. For example, if the author was supposed to pay $400 for the big room and the others $300 each, and they split it equally at $333, then the author is getting a better deal. But if they then agree to swap, with the author getting $30 from Y, the author's net is $303, Y's net is $363. If the original split was $333 each, then the author is underpaying and Y is overpaying. But the author's deal is that the author gets the smaller room and is compensated by Y. So from the landlord's perspective, the author is still paying $333, but Y is paying $333 plus $30 to the author. So the author isn't paying the landlord less. Therefore, X's payment remains the same. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't scamming X because the deal is between them and Y. Unless the original agreement was to all pay the same amount to the landlord regardless of room size, which is common. But if the author and Y have a private arrangement to adjust their payments, that's their choice. However, in some cases, changing the rent split could require all roommates to agree, especially if it affects the overall distribution. \n\nBut the user didn't mention that X was part of the original agreement regarding the big room. The author and Y had the discussion about the big room. X's problem is that he feels the author is getting a better deal. However, if the original rent split was equal, and the author is now not paying the same as the others (but instead getting $30 from Y), then X is paying more than the author for the same size room. That's a fairness issue. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong if the deal allows them to pay less than X for the same size room. But if the author and Y are still paying the same amount to the landlord (Y pays author $30, so their total to the landlord is same as author's), then it's a private matter. \n\nThe user's situation is a bit ambiguous. If the author's rent to the landlord is reduced because Y is paying part of it, then the author is in the wrong. If the author's total to the landlord remains the same, and Y is just compensating them for the room switch, then it's okay. The original method of random selection was fair, and the switch was agreed upon. The problem is whether the author is now undercontributing to the rent, making X pay more. \n\nThe user says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is giving up the big room in exchange for Y paying $30. If the author's rent to the landlord was originally based on the room size, but they split it equally, then by taking a smaller room, the author should be paying less. But if the landlord's rent is split equally, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, then the author is effectively paying $303 while X pays $333. That's not equal. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are not paying their fair share, making X subsidize the bigger room for Y. Even though the deal was between author and Y, it affects X's share if the total rent is fixed. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But the user might need to check if the rent split is supposed to be equal. If the landlord requires equal splits, but the author and Y adjust their payments privately, then the author is in the wrong. If the landlord allows for different splits, then it's okay. \n\nSince the user didn't specify the landlord's structure, but in most roommate scenarios, the rent is split equally regardless of room size unless otherwise agreed. Therefore, the author's deal might lead to an unequal split from X's perspective, making the author responsible for not considering X's input. So, the answer is A.\n"
