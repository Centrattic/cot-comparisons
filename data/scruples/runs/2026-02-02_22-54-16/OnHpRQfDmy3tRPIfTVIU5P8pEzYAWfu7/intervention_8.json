Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for what they did. The situation is about roommates and splitting rent for a bigger room. \n\nSo, the apartment has three bedrooms, one is 40% bigger. When moving in, the author and their roommates X and Y had to decide who gets the big room. The author wanted it, Y also wanted it. X didn't care. They discussed options: either randomize or highest bidder. Y said that the highest bidder wouldn't be fair because he doesn't earn as much as the author. So they used a random generator and the author won.\n\nThen, three days later, Y came back and wanted the big room, so the author offered a deal: Y can have it if he pays $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal and is calling him an asshole for scamming. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The initial agreement was a random selection, which both author and Y were okay with. The author got the room. Then, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the room. The author set a price for giving it up, and Y agreed. So, the author is now paying $30 less than Y per month for the same setup? Wait, no. Wait, X and Y are the other two roommates. The apartment has three rooms, so there are three people. The author is in the big room, and X is in one of the smaller ones. Y is in the other small room but pays an extra $30 to the author to switch. But then X is upset because he's in a smaller room, and the author is getting $30 from Y, making their rent lower than X's?\n\nWait, the initial rent split was probably even. Let's say the total rent is R. Each person pays R/3. But if the author is in the big room and Y is in a small one but paying $30 extra to the author, then the author's actual rent is (R/3) - $30, and Y's is (R/3) + $30. Meanwhile, X is still paying R/3. So X is paying the same as Y, but Y is effectively paying more total rent to the author. That seems odd. So X is upset because he's in a smaller room, and the author is getting money from Y, which might mean that the author isn't paying as much in total as the others. Or maybe the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, and X is in a smaller room but isn't getting any compensation. \n\nSo X's complaint is that the author is getting the same room as X but paying $30 less because of the deal with Y. Is that fair? The original agreement was a random draw. But then, after the initial allocation, the author and Y made a private deal. The problem is whether X should have been involved in that decision. \n\nThe author's argument is that the initial decision was fair with the coin flip (random.org). When Y wanted to switch, the author had the right to ask for compensation, which Y agreed to. So maybe the author isn't at fault because Y voluntarily accepted the deal, and the initial agreement was fair. But X was not part of that deal and is now paying the same as Y, but Y is paying more to the author, so the author effectively gets a discount. \n\nBut wait, the total rent is still split among the three, right? So the author's base rent is (R/3), but Y is paying $30 extra to the author. So the author's net is (R/3) + $30 from Y, and Y's is (R/3) - $30. X's is still (R/3). So maybe X is paying the same as the author's base, but the author is receiving extra. But that's because the author is the one who allowed Y to switch. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was that the big room is allocated via a raffle, and the author was fine with that, but then Y wanted to switch, and the author offered a price. If Y agreed, then the author isn't scamming anyone because it's a mutual agreement. \n\nBut X didn't want the big room, so he's in a small room. The author is getting $30 from Y, which might mean that the author is effectively getting a smaller share of the total rent, but that's only if the base rent wasn't adjusted. Wait, the total rent is split equally. If the author is in the big room, but Y is in a small one and paying an extra $30 to the author, the author is getting $30 from Y. So the author's actual contribution to the total rent is (R/3) - $30, but X is paying (R/3). So X is paying more than the author. That's the crux of X's complaint. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong in the initial agreement. The problem is that X wasn't part of the subsequent deal. The author had the right to the big room, and Y wanted to take it by paying. So unless the original agreement stated that any changes require all roommates' consent, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, in some places, when you have a roommate situation, all parties might need to agree to such a change. But the original question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author and Y made a deal, and X is upset because he's not getting that deal. But the author didn't do anything to X. The initial agreement with X was that he didn't care about the room. So if X didn't want to be part of the rent split thing, he could have argued for a different arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total rent isn't split equally. If the total rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the author is getting a better deal by being in the bigger room. But if the total rent includes a separate cost for the bigger room, then maybe the author should be paying more. However, in this case, the author isn't paying more; instead, Y is paying extra to the author. That's a private agreement, but if X is paying the same as the author, then X is effectively subsidizing the author's larger room. \n\nBut the author and Y made a deal where Y pays $30 extra to the author. So the author is getting $30 from Y. If the total rent is split equally, then the author's net is (R/3) - $30, which is less than X's R/3. So X is paying more than the author. That's the issue. X is in a smaller room but paying the same as the author's base. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything to X. The problem is that X didn't get to negotiate. However, the initial agreement was that the author and Y would decide. If X didn't care initially, maybe he should have. But he didn't, so he's in a smaller room. The author is not in the wrong because they had the right to the big room and could negotiate with Y. Y agreed, so it's a fair deal. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author followed the initial agreement and made a deal with Y that both agreed to. X's grievance is about his own room and rent, but the author's actions are within their rights unless there was a prior agreement that all room changes require majority or all consent. Since there wasn't, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
