Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and assigning a bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving into an apartment with three rooms\u2014two smaller and one bigger. The author, along with roommates X and Y, decided how to assign the big room. Initially, Y wanted the big room, and the author also wanted it. They discussed methods: random selection or paying extra. Y thought paying might be unfair due to income differences, so they went with a random roll. The author won and got the big room.\n\nBut then, after three days, Y changed his mind and asked for a deal. The author said if Y pays $30 extra each month, Y can have the room. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because the author and X are paying the same rent but the author is effectively paying 30$ less (since Y is covering 30$ of the author's rent in exchange for the room). X thinks this is unfair and calls the author a scammer.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nInitially, the random selection was agreed upon, so the author had the right to the big room. Then Y wanted to negotiate a swap, and the author offered a deal where Y would pay $30/month. Since both agreed, that seems like a mutual agreement. However, the issue is that X is now upset because his rent remains the same, but the author is getting a financial benefit. \n\nBut wait, how does the rent split work here? If the total rent is divided equally among the three, then each pays a third. But if Y is giving the author $30, maybe the total rent isn't adjusted. So, effectively, Y is paying the author $30, but the author is in the bigger room. So, the author is getting the bigger room without paying more rent, and Y is paying the author to take the smaller room. That might be where the problem is. \n\nX is paying the same as the author, but the author has the bigger room, and also receives $30 from Y. Wait, no\u2014maybe the original rent is split equally. So if the total rent is, say, $1000, each pays $333. The author is in the big room. Then Y offers to pay the author $30/month to take the smaller room. So Y would be in the big room, but now Y is paying $333 (original) plus $30 to the author, totaling $363. The author would be getting $333 from the landlord and $30 from Y, so effectively, the author is making $63 more than Y. But X is still paying $333. \n\nBut the problem is that the initial agreement was through a random draw. The author won, but then allowed Y to take the room in exchange for $30. If the others weren't involved in that agreement, maybe the issue is that the author didn't involve X in the decision-making. However, the original problem was between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nIs the author allowed to negotiate the room swap with Y as long as it's a private agreement? If the original room assignment was done via a fair method (random.org), then the author had the right to the room. If Y wanted to take it, a mutual agreement to exchange the room for money is acceptable. However, the issue arises because the rent is split equally, so Y is paying more in total, while X is paying the same. But X's problem is that the author is paying less rent than X (since the author is receiving $30 from Y, making his effective contribution lower). \n\nWait, actually, maybe the rent is split equally, so each person pays 1/3 of the total. If the author is getting $30 from Y, that means the author's out-of-pocket is reduced by $30. So if the total rent is $900, each pays $300. The author is getting $30 from Y, so the author's net is $270, while Y pays $330 (original $300 + $30 to the author). X still pays $300. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is effectively paying less. X is upset because he's not getting any extra money and is paying more than the author. \n\nIs this fair? It depends on how the room assignments affect the rent. If the big room is worth more, maybe the rent should be adjusted. But in this case, the total rent is fixed, and the room assignment is done via roommates. The author and Y made a private agreement to swap rooms with a monetary exchange. However, this affects the rent distribution. \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have involved X in the agreement. Since the initial agreement was between the author and Y, and X wasn't part of it, maybe X feels left out. However, if the original agreement was about room assignment and not rent splitting, then the $30 deal is between Y and the author. \n\nBut in reality, the rent splitting is a group decision. If the group decided to split the rent equally, then any side deals between two roommates that affect the actual amount each person pays could be problematic. If the author is receiving money from Y, that effectively reduces the author's share of the rent, which might not be fair to X if the original agreement was to split equally. \n\nSo, if the total rent is split equally, but one roommate is effectively paying less because another is giving them money, that could be seen as unfair to the third roommate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the side deal between Y and the author creates an unequal distribution of the total rent burden, even though the initial room assignment was fair. \n\nAlternatively, if the room assignment and rent for each room are separate, maybe the author and Y could negotiate their own terms. But if the rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the author is getting the better deal. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's agreement with Y affects the overall fairness of the rent split for X. Since the initial agreement was to split rent equally, the author shouldn't have made a side deal that results in an unequal contribution to the total rent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.
