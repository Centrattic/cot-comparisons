Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for getting a bigger room by paying $30 less rent after a roommate wanted it but couldn't afford to bid higher. \n\nFirst, the initial agreement: they used a random number generator to decide who gets the big room because there was a conflict between wanting fairness and differing incomes. The user won, so they got the big room. Then, after a few days, the other roommate (Y) asked for it again and offered to pay $30 more each month. The user agreed, so Y took the big room, and now another roommate (X) is upset because they're paying the same rent for a smaller room.\n\nThe key points here are the original agreement and the fairness of the arrangement. When they first decided, they used a random method because Y couldn't bid higher due to income issues. The user gave up their claim when Y offered $30. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. Now X feels it's unfair because they're not getting the same deal.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the initial decision was fair with a random draw. Then, when Y wanted the room, the user made a private agreement with Y. But X wasn't involved in that. The problem is that the rent split might not account for room sizes. If all three were paying the same rent regardless of room size, then Y effectively paying $30 more (by giving it to the user) creates an imbalance. However, if the original rent was split equally, and the user is getting $30 from Y, that might mean the user is effectively paying less than their share, which could be seen as unfair to X.\n\nBut the user didn't take money from X. The issue is that X is paying the same rent for a smaller room, while the user is getting a financial benefit. However, the user didn't force X into this arrangement. The original agreement between the user and Y might be a private matter, but if the overall rent isn't adjusted based on room size, then X is correct in feeling it's unfair. The user might be in the wrong if the arrangement with Y affects X's share without their consent. \n\nAlternatively, if the rent was split equally regardless of room size, then maybe the user's arrangement with Y is a side deal that's not inherently wrong. But if the total rent isn't adjusted, then X is subsidizing the bigger room for Y. The user might have an obligation to ensure that the rent is split fairly based on room sizes, which they didn't do. So, by accepting $30 from Y without adjusting the overall rent, the user is effectively getting a discount, which could be seen as unfair to X. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because the arrangement with Y affects X's contribution without his agreement.\n"
