Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo the setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. The big room is 40% larger, and there was a dispute over who gets it. The author, Y, and X are the roommates. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. The author suggested a random selection or a bid, but Y argued about income disparity. They flipped a coin (using random.org) and the author won. Then Y came back a few days later, wanting the room because his bed didn't fit, and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he doesn't see why the author is paying less rent for the same room size.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points: the initial agreement was a random selection, which the author won. Then, the author made a deal with Y to switch the room condition if Y paid extra. X is not part of that deal. The problem is that X feels the author is getting an unfair advantage by paying less.\n\nIs this a case of the author acting unfairly? Let's consider roommate agreements. Typically, if all parties agree to a certain arrangement, it's up to them. However, in this case, the author and Y made a private agreement that might affect X. But X was not part of the initial decision to let Y pay extra. The original split was based on the coin flip, which included all roommates, maybe? Or was the rent split equally before?\n\nThe author mentions that after the coin flip, the big room is \"rightfully\" theirs. Then Y asked to switch, and the author allowed it with a $30 payment. So, if the total rent is split equally, and Y is paying $30 more to the author, does that mean Y is paying more in total? The author is effectively paying $30 less. But how does this affect X? If the total rent is split three ways, and the author is paying $30 less than their share, while Y is paying $30 more, then X's share is the same as it was originally. But if the initial agreement was that the big room is worth more, maybe the rent should be split differently. However, the author and Y made a private deal without X's consent. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was that the big room was determined by the coin flip, and the author ceded it to Y with a side payment, maybe that's a valid arrangement. But if X's rent is now effectively higher because the author is paying less, that could be an issue. However, the problem is that the author and Y are handling the room allocation and payments among themselves, which might not be transparent or fair to X. \n\nAnother angle: in shared housing, room assignments and rent splits usually require all roommates to agree. If the author and Y made a deal that changes the rent distribution without consulting X, that could be problematic. X might feel that this is unfair because he's paying the same as the author, even though the author's room is smaller. If the rent was split equally before, now the author is effectively getting a better deal by paying less per square meter. But the author is not taking money from X; Y is paying the author. So maybe the issue is that the author and Y's arrangement affects X's perception of fairness. \n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrongfully. If the author and Y made a private agreement without X's knowledge, and X is now upset because his share of the rent is higher relative to the author's, then the author might be at fault for not involving X in the decision. But if the author did not charge X anything and the side payment is between Y and the author, perhaps it's not the author's fault. It might depend on the original terms of the roommate agreement. If the initial agreement was that the big room is determined by the coin flip, and then a new agreement was made between two roommates without consulting the third, that could be where the issue lies. \n\nIn many cohabitation situations, all roommates should agree on any arrangements that affect rent or room assignments. The author might not be in the wrong if they had a valid reason and the deal was between two parties. However, if X was part of the original agreement about room allocation and the subsequent change affects him without his consent, then the author might have a responsibility to involve X. The answer could hinge on whether the author's actions violated the group's initial agreement or norms.\n"
