Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if they're at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. So, the situation is that three people moved in together, with three bedrooms. The bigger room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y did. Z wanted it too, so they proposed a random selection or a bidding system where the highest income pays more rent. Y said it's not fair because they don't have as high income, so they went with a random.org roll, and Z won. Then after three days, Y came back asking if Z could give up the room in exchange for $30/month. Z agreed, so Y pays Z $30, and thus Z's rent is effectively lower. Now X is upset because Z and X have the same square meter room but Z is paying $30 less. X thinks Z is scamming him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness here. The initial agreement was to use a random number generator because Y didn't want to bid due to income differences. Then Z got the big room through the random selection. Later, Y approached Z to negotiate, and Z accepted the $30 monthly payment to switch. Now, the problem is that X feels left out because the rent isn't adjusted accordingly. \n\nBut wait, the apartment's total rent isn't mentioned. If the three are splitting the total rent equally, but Y is paying Z $30 to take the big room, then Z's share of the total rent is actually less than X's and Y's. That's because Y is effectively paying Z extra money, so Z isn't paying their full third of the rent. This creates an imbalance. \n\nX's complaint is about the fairness of rent distribution. If the big room is worth more, then the person in it should pay more. But in this case, Z is getting the big room while paying less, because Y is subsidizing Z's rent. That might not be fair to X. \n\nThe question is whether Z is in the wrong. The initial selection was fair, but then the arrangement with Y might have been the issue. The problem arises because the financial arrangement between Z and Y isn't transparent. X is part of the tenancy agreement, so any changes should involve all roommates. By allowing Y to pay Z $30, Z is effectively getting a discount, while X's share remains the same. \n\nIn most roommate situations, if someone is in a larger room, they should pay a proportionally higher share of the rent. Here, Y is in a bigger room but paying the same as X, except that Z is receiving $30 from Y. This means the total rent paid by each is unequal. X is paying their third, Y is paying their third plus $30 to Z, but Z is only paying their third minus $30. So Z's total contribution is less, which is why X is upset. \n\nIs Z scamming X? Well, if the original agreement was that the big room would be allocated fairly, but then Z allowed Y to take it in exchange for money, without adjusting the overall rent split, then Z is exploiting the situation. The problem is that X is paying the same as before, but Z and Y's financial arrangements are causing an imbalance. \n\nMaybe the correct approach would have been to have a new agreement where Y pays more of the total rent, not just transfer money to Z. That way, all roommates' shares are adjusted properly. Since Z didn't involve X in the negotiation, X might feel that the process was unfair. \n\nSo, the answer here would depend on whether the initial random selection was meant to be a final decision. Since Z got the big room through a agreed-upon method but then allowed Y to take it for a personal gain (lower rent) without adjusting the overall rent split, this could be seen as unfair to X. Therefore, Z might be in the wrong because they didn't consider X's perspective in the financial arrangement, leading to an unequal distribution of total rent costs.\n"
