Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, there are three roommates. When they moved in, there were three bedrooms, one significantly bigger. The author wanted the big room. They asked their roommates X and Y who would take it. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author suggested a random draw or a bidding process. Y thought a bidding wasn't fair because of income differences, so they went with a random.org roll, and the author won. So initially, the author got the big room through a fair method agreed upon by Y.\n\nThen, after three days, Y came back and said they needed the big room because of their bed and offered to pay $30/month extra for it. The author agreed, allowing Y to take the big room with the $30 payment. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent by giving up the big room for $30.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for this arrangement. Let's consider the dynamics. The initial allocation was fair (random.org). Y approached the author directly to negotiate a trade. The author set a price for giving up the big room, which Y accepted. X feels left out because he wasn't part of the negotiation.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author had the legal right to the big room via the initial agreement. They chose to trade that right for money with Y. Since the room size affects rent, it's possible the original rent split was based on equal shares despite different room sizes. By allowing Y to have the big room and charge him $30 more, the author is adjusting the payment to reflect the room's value. That might be fair, but X is upset because he's not getting the same benefit.\n\nHowever, X wasn't part of the original negotiation. The author dealt directly with Y. If the room exchange affects the overall rent distribution, maybe the original agreement among all three should have been considered. The problem is whether the author should have included X in the negotiation or if it's just between the author and Y.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" seems harsh. The author isn't defrauding; they're making a mutual agreement with Y. But perhaps the issue is about transparency and fairness in the room allocation process. If the initial random draw was supposed to be final, then Y's request to trade might have been a separate matter. The author had the right to their room and could negotiate its transfer.\n\nIn many roommate agreements, room assignments and rent splits are part of the terms. If the room sizes differ, splitting the rent equally might be unfair, but in this case, the author and Y adjusted the payment. The problem arises because X wasn't part of that adjustment, leading to an unequal split between the author and X, which X is upset about.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the original agreement implied that all room changes require consensus among all roommates. If the author made a bilateral agreement without X's input, that could be seen as unfair to X. However, if the original agreement allowed for room trading with mutual consent (between the current occupant and the requester), then the author isn't wrong.\n\nBut the key point is that after the initial allocation, the author had the right to their room. The trade with Y was a separate agreement. However, if the rent is split equally among all three, then the author is effectively getting a better deal than X by receiving $30 from Y. If the total rent is divided equally, but the author is getting $30 extra from Y, that might not be fair unless all roommates agree to a different rent structure.\n\nWait, the original setup was that the author and Y were sharing rent equally, maybe? If the total rent is split three ways, and the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author's total payment is reduced by $30, while X's payment stays the same. That creates a discrepancy between X and the author. If X didn't agree to this arrangement, he might feel he's paying more than his share.\n\nBut if the room sizes are different, splitting the rent equally is already problematic. The standard approach in such cases is to split rent based on room size. However, if the original agreement was equal split regardless of room size, then the author and Y's deal to adjust the payment might be a way to compensate for the room size difference. But in that case, the adjustment should also be communicated to X to ensure fairness.\n\nSo, maybe the author's mistake was not involving X in the rent adjustment. If the room sizes are different, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. The author and Y's private deal might have solved their issue but left X in an unfair situation. Therefore, the author should have included X in the negotiation to ensure all roommates had equal terms.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for negotiating the room trade with Y, but they should have considered the impact on X and included him in the discussion to maintain fairness among all three. The fact that X is now upset highlights that the author didn't consider the broader implications of their agreement on the group. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve X in the decision that affected the rent distribution for all.\n"
