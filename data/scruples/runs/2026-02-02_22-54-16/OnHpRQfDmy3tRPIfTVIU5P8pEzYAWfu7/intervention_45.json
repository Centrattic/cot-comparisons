Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. The author moved in with two others, X and Y. Before moving in, there was a discussion about who gets the bigger room. Y really wanted it, but the author also wanted it. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y came back asking for the big room, offering to pay $30 more each month. The author agreed, so Y moved into the big room, and now the author is paying $30 less. Now X is upset because he's getting the same size room but paying more. He's accusing the author of scamming him.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there was an agreement beforehand. The initial allocation was random, which seems fair. The author and Y then made a private agreement where Y pays an extra $30 to take the bigger room. The problem is whether this affects X. If the rent was originally split equally among all three, then by Y paying an extra $30, the author is effectively paying $30 less. But if the total rent is fixed, then maybe X is paying more than he should if the room sizes are different. However, in the initial setup, they didn't mention splitting rent based on room size. The author and Y made a side deal without involving X. \n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the original agreement specify how rent would be split, especially considering room sizes? 2) Was X part of the agreement? 3) Is it fair for the author to have a different payment arrangement without X's consent?\n\nIf the original rent split was equal regardless of room size, then when the author and Y made a side deal, it's possible that X is now paying a larger share of the total rent, which could be unfair. However, if the author and Y's agreement is a voluntary exchange where Y compensates the author for the room, then maybe it's fair. But since X wasn't part of that agreement, he might feel it's unfair because his rent isn't adjusted. \n\nAnother angle is that the initial random selection was supposed to settle the room allocation. If Y later wants to switch, the author is within their right to charge for that switch, especially if Y is willing to pay. However, if the overall rent structure isn't adjusted to account for the different room sizes, then perhaps X is being treated unfairly. The problem is whether the author should have included X in the new arrangement or if the deal between the author and Y is a separate matter.\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, all roommates should agree on the rent split and room assignments. If the author and Y made a private agreement without considering X's input, it's possible that X feels his stake in the financial arrangement was ignored. The author might be in the wrong if the deal affects X's share of the rent without his consent. However, if the author's rent was adjusted by Y's payment, and X's portion remains the same, then maybe it's a different scenario. The question is whether the original rent division accounted for room sizes. If not, then adjusting it after the fact without consensus might be an issue.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong if the deal between them and Y altered the rent split in a way that wasn't agreed upon by all roommates, especially if it leads to unequal contributions without clear justification. But if the original agreement was equal and the author and Y's deal is a separate compensation for room size, then maybe not. However, since the initial problem was about room size affecting rent, it's likely that X's complaint is valid because the author is benefiting from a different arrangement that wasn't transparent or agreed upon by everyone. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the deal should have involved all parties to maintain fairness.\n"
