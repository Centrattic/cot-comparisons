Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and how the rent is split. The main person (the author) and two others, X and Y. They had a three-bedroom apartment with one room 40% bigger.\n\nAt first, before moving in, they had to decide who gets the big room. The author wanted it, and so did Y. Y said he really wanted it, and the author suggested either randomizing or having a bidding based on income. Y thought bidding wasn't fair because the author had a higher income, so they used a random number generator. The author won and got the big room.\n\nThen after three days, Y came back saying he needed the big room for his bed and offered to pay $30 more to the author each month. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room but pays $30 extra. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a smaller room and paying less rent. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Initially, the big room was assigned via a fair random method everyone agreed to. Then Y wanted to switch, and the author agreed to a side deal where Y pays extra. But X didn't know about this and now feels it's unfair that the author isn't paying as much. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to make that deal with Y without involving X? The initial agreement was between the author and Y, but X is now part of the arrangement because the rent distribution is affected. If the total rent is split among all three, but Y is paying the author $30, that might be creating an imbalance in the shared rent.\n\nWait, but how is the rent structured? If the total rent is split equally among the three, then each person pays the same amount. But if Y is paying the author $30, that means Y is effectively paying $30 more to the author, while X is still paying the same as the author. So X's total payment is the same as the author's, but Y is paying more to the author. But X might not know about this side agreement, so he's not aware that Y is actually paying more in total. \n\nX's problem is that he's paying the same as the author, but the author has a smaller room. But actually, the author is getting the $30 from Y, which he might be using for himself. So from X's perspective, he's being charged the same as the author but the author has a smaller room. That's why X is upset.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author and Y both agreed to the $30 payment. However, if the original agreement was that all room assignments would be determined fairly (random.org), and then a unilateral change was made without involving X, that could be problematic. Also, if the total rent isn't adjusted so that everyone's contribution reflects their room size, then there's an issue. \n\nIn roommate situations, typically, if one person is getting a larger room, they might pay a higher share of the rent. But in this case, the author was assigned the big room via random, then gave it up for $30. But if the total rent is split equally, the $30 is a private agreement. However, X is now paying the same as the author, who has a smaller room. So X feels it's unfair because the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. \n\nThe author might not have considered that X's contribution should be adjusted if the room sizes differ. By allowing Y to pay extra privately, the author is effectively making X subsidize the author's room when the author has the small room, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because the side payment doesn't account for the fact that X is paying the same as the author for a smaller room. The initial random assignment was fair, but the subsequent change without adjusting the overall rent structure between all roommates might have been unfair to X. Therefore, the author should have involved X in the renegotiation to ensure everyone's rent is adjusted based on room size, rather than just a private payment between them and Y.\n"
