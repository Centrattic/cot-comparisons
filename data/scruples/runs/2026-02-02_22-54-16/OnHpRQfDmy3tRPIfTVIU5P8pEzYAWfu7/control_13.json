Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The setup is about roommates and the big room. So, the author initially won the big room through a random draw because Y wanted it but didn't want a bidding war. Then Y came back and offered to pay $30 more a month for the room, so the author agreed. Now X is upset because the author is paying less rent.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an agreement between all roommates regarding the rent division. The original problem is that the apartment is split into three rooms, with one bigger. The initial allocation was via random.org, which the author won. Then Y wanted it and offered to pay $30 more. The author accepted. But X is upset because now the author is paying less than him.\n\nWait, the rent structure isn't clear. Do all roommates split the rent equally, or is it adjusted based on room size? If the rent was split equally, but the author is in a bigger room, maybe X and Y are now paying the same, but the author is getting $30 from Y. That might create an imbalance. But if the original agreement was that the big room is worth more, and Y is paying extra to the author, maybe the author is just compensating for the size difference. However, the original rent split might not account for room size. If the total rent is split equally, then the author is effectively getting an extra $30, which could be seen as unfair to X.\n\nAnother angle: when the author agreed to Y's payment, did they consider X's share? If X is paying the same as Y but the author is getting more, maybe X feels it's unfair. The key is whether the arrangement was discussed with all roommates. The author only negotiated with Y, not X. If the original agreement was for all three, then maybe the author should have involved X in the decision. However, if the initial room assignment was agreed upon by all (the random draw), then the author's decision to transfer the room to Y with a monetary exchange might be their prerogative as long as it's voluntary.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" is strong. If the author is just charging Y for the room they won, and it's a private agreement between two roommates, then X might not be directly affected. But if the rent is split equally, and the author is keeping the $30, that could create an imbalance in the total amount each pays. Maybe X is paying the same as Y, but Y is effectively paying more because they're giving $30 to the author. So, the total effective rent for Y is higher, but X is not. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as Y, but the author is getting extra money, which might feel unfair. \n\nBut if the original room allocation was done with a method agreed upon by all (the random draw), then the author's right to assign the room as they see fit might be valid. However, taking money from Y without consulting X could be an issue if the rent structure isn't adjusted. If the total rent is fixed and split equally, the author shouldn't be getting money from Y as it's a separate arrangement that affects the perceived fairness among roommates. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if there was no prior agreement on how to adjust rent based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might not be fair to X. The author could be seen as creating an unequal distribution without all parties' consent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision-making process, leading to an unequal distribution of costs among roommates.\n"
