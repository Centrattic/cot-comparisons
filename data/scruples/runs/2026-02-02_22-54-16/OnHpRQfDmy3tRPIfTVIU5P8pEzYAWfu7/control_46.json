Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and how the rent is split. The author initially had a random draw with Y and won the big room. Then Y asked to swap, and the author agreed to a deal where Y pays $30 extra each month to the author. Now X is upset because he feels the author is getting an unfair advantage by charging that extra money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial agreement. They had three people, two smaller rooms, one bigger. The author and Y wanted the big room. They decided to randomize, and the author got it. Then Y wanted to swap. The author offered a financial arrangement where Y pays $30 a month to the author. X is now upset because he's not part of this arrangement and feels the author is scamming him by getting more money for the big room when they all split the rent equally otherwise.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the initial decision to randomize among Y and the author fair to X? If all three roommates were splitting the rent equally, then maybe X didn't get a say, which could be an issue. The author and Y decided between themselves without involving X. But the author didn't take anything from X directly; the $30 is going from Y to the author. However, X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, which he perceives as unfair.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author has the right to charge Y for the big room. If the total rent is split equally among all three, then maybe the author is effectively overcompensated by taking an extra $30 from Y. But if the agreement between the author and Y was that Y would pay $30 more to have the bigger room, then it's a side agreement. However, if the original agreement was that the big room's value is part of the shared rent, then maybe the author shouldn't charge Y extra because that's already factored into the shared rent.\n\nAlso, X might feel excluded because the decision was made between two of the three roommates without his input. He might not agree with the financial arrangement and feels the author is exploiting the situation. The author's argument is that they wanted the big room and Y was willing to pay for it, but X's perspective is that this creates an imbalance in their shared living situation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if all roommates had an equal say in who gets which room and how rent is divided, the author might have been wrong to exclude X from the decision. However, since X didn't express interest in the big room initially, maybe it's acceptable. But once Y wanted to swap, involving all parties might have been necessary to maintain fairness.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include X in the decision-making process, leading to an arrangement that benefits them financially at X's expense. Even though the $30 is between the author and Y, it creates an imbalance in the shared rent split, which affects X. Therefore, the author's actions might be seen as unfair to X.\n"
