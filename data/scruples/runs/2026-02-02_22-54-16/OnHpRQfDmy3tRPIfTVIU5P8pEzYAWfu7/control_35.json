Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves three roommates and a bigger room. Let's break down the timeline and actions.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the author and Y wanted the big room. Y initially didn't want to bid because of income disparity, so they flipped a coin (using random.org), and the author won. Then, after three days, Y asked for the room again, and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent for a smaller room.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's agreement with Y was fair and if it's valid without consulting X. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The author and Y decided on a random method to allocate the big room. The author got it. This seems fair since both wanted it and agreed on a neutral method.\n\n2. **Y's Request Later**: After three days, Y wanted the room back. The author offered a trade: Y pays $30/month for the bigger room. Y agreed. This is a private agreement between two parties. Unless there's a prior agreement about room assignments affecting rent, this seems like a mutual arrangement.\n\n3. **X's Complaint**: X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but in a smaller room. The problem here is that X wasn't part of the initial agreement. If all three roommates were supposed to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might have disrupted that. But if the original agreement allowed for room-specific rent adjustments, then it's okay.\n\n4. **Fairness and Communication**: The author didn't consult X when making the deal with Y. Even if the deal is fair between the author and Y, involving all roommates might be necessary if the rent structure is communal. If the rent is split equally, then Y paying the author $30 could mean Y is effectively paying more total, which might not be equitable if X isn't aware or agrees.\n\n5. **Legality and Social Norms**: In roommate situations, unless there's a formal agreement stating that room assignments affect rent, changing the arrangement unilaterally could be seen as unfair. The author might have assumed that since they paid the author $30, it's a private matter, but in reality, it affects X's perception of fairness because the rent distribution is now unequal among roommates.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not considering that their agreement with Y would affect X's rent perception. Even if Y and the author agreed, if the total rent is split equally, then Y is essentially paying more by giving $30 to the author, which isn't a standard practice unless all roommates agree. This could lead to disputes as others feel it's unfair.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision and created an unequal distribution without his consent, leading to his dissatisfaction. The answer should be A.\n"
