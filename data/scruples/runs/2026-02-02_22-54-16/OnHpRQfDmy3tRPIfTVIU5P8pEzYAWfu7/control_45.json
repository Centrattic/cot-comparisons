Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves room assignments and rent splitting between three roommates.\n\nFirst, the apartment has three rooms, with one bigger than the others. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won. Then Y came back after three days and wanted the room, so they agreed that if Y pays $30 extra monthly, the author would give up the big room. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying $30 less rent, even though he's in a similar-sized room.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, they used a fair method (random.org) to assign the big room. The author won, which seems fair. Y then wanted to buy the room by paying extra, so the author agreed to a $30/month payment. That seems like a mutual agreement between Y and the author. However, X is upset because he wasn't part of this negotiation and feels it's unfair that the author gets a discount while he doesn't.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to negotiate the room assignment with Y, and is the $30 deal fair? Also, was X informed and involved in the decision? The original agreement was between the author and Y, but since all three roommates are splitting the rent, maybe there's an issue with transparency or fairness in how the rent is split overall.\n\nTypically, when roommates split rent, if one person gets a better room, it's common to adjust their share of the rent. The author and Y made an agreement without involving X, which might have led to an unequal distribution of rent that X didn't agree to. X's main complaint is that he's paying the same as the author, who has a smaller room, but the author is effectively paying less because of the $30 discount from Y. So the total rent split might not be fair from X's perspective.\n\nBut wait, if all three are sharing the total rent equally, then the author's $30 being paid to them by Y would mean the author is getting $30 more in total (since they're paying $30 less and receiving $30 from Y). But that's just moving money around within the group. However, X might not be aware of this arrangement. If the original rent agreement was that everyone pays equal shares regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y might be circumventing that agreement. \n\nAlternatively, if the group intended that the big room would cost more rent, but they didn't formalize that up front, then Y's willingness to pay extra might be a way to adjust for that. However, X wasn't part of that discussion, so he feels left out. The problem here is that the author and Y made a private agreement that affects X's share of the rent without his consent. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's generally important that any agreements about room assignments and rent splits are agreed upon by all parties. If the author and Y changed the arrangement without X's input, that's where the issue lies. Even if the initial random draw was fair, changing it later for an extra payment without considering the impact on the third roommate is problematic. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not involving X in the subsequent negotiations. The fact that X is now paying the same as the author, but the author is effectively getting a discount via Y's payment, creates a situation where the rent split isn't transparent or agreed upon by all. Therefore, the author is at fault for not including X in the decision-making process, leading to perceived unfairness.\n"
