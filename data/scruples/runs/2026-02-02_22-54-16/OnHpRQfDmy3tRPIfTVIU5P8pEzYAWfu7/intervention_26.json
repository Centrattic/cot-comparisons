Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nSo the setup is three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms, one of which is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the writer asked the roommates (X and Y) who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The writer also wanted it and proposed either randomizing or having a bidding war. Y objected to bidding because he has a lower income, so they went with a random.org roll, and the writer got the big room.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed his mind and asked for the big room, claiming he needed it for his bed. The writer offered to give up the room if Y pays $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he feels the writer is getting a better deal, same room but paying $30 less, and accuses the writer of scamming him.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is at fault. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial agreement. The roommates all agreed to a random draw because Y didn't want a bidding war due to income disparities. The writer won the roll and thus got the big room. That part seems fair. If they had gone with the bid, the writer might have gotten it because they could pay more, so the draw was a compromise to be fair. So the initial assignment was based on mutual agreement.\n\nThen Y comes back after three days and wants to switch. The writer is also attached to the room, so they negotiate a deal where Y can take the room if he pays $30 extra. Y agrees. Now, X is upset because he wasn't part of this negotiation. But X didn't express any interest in the big room when they first discussed it. The original problem only involved the writer and Y, as X was indifferent.\n\nThe key point here is whether X should have a say in the later negotiation. Since X didn't care which room he got and didn't participate in the initial decision, unless there's a rule that a third party can challenge a prior agreement, the deal between the writer and Y is their own. However, since they all share the same rent split, if Y is paying more to the writer, that might affect X's share. But the story says the writer is paying $30 less, not that Y is paying the writer. Wait, the writer said \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Y is paying the writer $30? Or is the writer paying $30 less to the landlord? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read that part.\n\nThe writer says: \"I should have taken this up with him as well.\" So X is mad about the $30 difference. If the writer is paying $30 less in rent, that might lower their share, but if they have a fixed rent split, the others might have to cover the difference. Wait, how is the rent divided? The apartment's total rent isn't mentioned. If the rent is split equally, but the writer is in a bigger room and paying less, that would be unfair to X and Y. But the initial agreement was to assign the big room via a roll. However, when Y took the room, the writer allowed Y to pay $30 extra per month. If that $30 is going to the writer instead of the landlord, then the landlord's total rent remains the same, but the roommates are effectively paying the writer. That could be seen as unfair to X, who didn't get a chance to negotiate. But if the $30 is going to the landlord, adjusting the rent for Y, then X's share would still be the same as before. The problem is X is now paying the same as the writer, who has a bigger room. But in the initial setup, they decided the big room would go to the writer via a roll. So the writer didn't take the big room through a bid, but through a random draw. Then Y changed his mind and the writer allowed Y to take it if he pays more. But if the total rent isn't being split according to room sizes, then the writer is paying less for a bigger room, which X is now upset about.\n\nSo the issue is whether the initial agreement with Y overrides X's later complaints. Since X was indifferent at first, maybe he didn't realize the implications of the room size and rent split. The writer and Y made a private agreement after the initial assignment. If the writers' deal with Y caused an unfair distribution to X, then the writer might be in the wrong. But if the total rent is split equally regardless of room size, then having a bigger room for less rent could be seen as unfair to the others. However, the initial decision to assign the big room via random.org might mean that the writer's right to it is legitimate. Alternatively, the deal between the writer and Y might be arbitrary and not considered in the overall rent split.\n\nAnother angle: when roommates have different sized rooms, it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. If they didn't do that and split the rent equally, then the bigger room is a perk for less money. But in this case, the writer initially paid the same as others, got the big room via a roll. Then Y took over the big room and paid $30 more. So if the writer is now in a smaller room and paying the same as before, but Y is in the big room and paying $30 more, then the rent split is adjusted to room size. But X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the writer, who is now in a smaller room as well. Wait, the writer moved to a smaller room, and Y took the big one. But the writer is paying $30 less? That doesn't make sense. If the writer is in a smaller room now, but their rent is $30 less, that would mean Y is paying more to the landlord. But how does that affect X? If the total rent is split equally, and Y is paying $30 more, then the writer would receive $30 from Y, making their net payment the same as before. But X is still paying the same as before. So X is now in a same-sized room as the writer but the writer is effectively getting $30 from Y each month. So X feels like the writer is getting an unfair advantage because they didn't have to pay as much for their room. But the initial assignment was a random draw, so maybe the writer is justified in keeping the room or negotiating its value. However, the problem is that the writer and Y's deal might be circumventing the original agreement, or not considering X's contribution. If the total rent is split equally, then allowing Y to pay more for the big room could create a situation where the writer is being compensated, but X isn't. That might be unfair to X, who didn't get a chance to participate in the negotiation. \n\nBut the original question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The initial agreement was that the big room was assigned via a roll. Then Y wanted to switch, so the writer asked for $30. Y agreed. So the writer and Y made an agreement, but X wasn't part of that. If the writer is receiving $30 from Y to switch rooms, then the writer is getting money for the room, which could be seen as creating a private agreement that affects the overall rent structure. If the landlord's total rent is fixed, and the writer is effectively getting a cut of Y's payment, that might not be fair to X, who is still paying the same. Alternatively, if the writer is just paying $30 less to the landlord, then maybe the total rent is being adjusted, but X's share isn't. But the story isn't clear on how the rent is split. \n\nAssuming that the roommates split the total rent equally regardless of room size, then the writer moving to a smaller room and Y moving to a bigger one but the rent split remains the same, X would be paying the same as the writer for a smaller room. However, the writer is now in a smaller room but still paying the same as before. Wait, no. If the writer gave up the big room to Y for $30, that suggests that the writer is now in a smaller room but is getting $30 from Y to compensate. So the writer's net payment is reduced by $30. If X is still paying the same amount as before, then the writer is getting $30 less than X for a smaller room, which might make X feel like the writer is benefiting. But the original agreement was to assign the big room via a roll. X didn't participate in that decision, so maybe he should have tried to negotiate when he realized the room sizes and rent splits were problematic. \n\nAlternatively, when Y asked to switch, the writer had the right to negotiate terms. Since X was indifferent at first, maybe he didn't care about the room size. Now that Y has the big room for higher rent, perhaps the writer is in the smaller room but with the $30 reduction. If the total rent isn't adjusted, then the writer is getting a better deal. But if the total rent is adjusted so that Y pays more, and the writer pays less, then that's a fair trade. However, if X is paying the same as the writer (who is in a smaller room), then X's rent is effectively higher relative to the room size. But X didn't say anything when the rooms were assigned. Now that the rooms have changed, X is upset. \n\nThe writer might be at fault here because the deal with Y could affect the overall rent split. Since all roommates share the total rent, any private agreement between two of them to shift payments might be unfair to the third. Unless the landlord adjusted the rent for Y, and the writer's share was reduced accordingly. If the writer is getting $30 from Y, then the landlord's total rent is split as X pays the same, Y pays his share plus $30 to the writer, and the writer pays their original share minus $30. In that case, the writer is effectively getting a discount for a smaller room, which might be acceptable if the total rent is split based on room size. But if the original agreement was on a per-room basis, then the writer and Y's deal might be outside the group agreement. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all roommates agree on the rent split. If the writer and Y made a private deal without discussing with X, then X's complaint is valid. But if the deal was only between writer and Y, and the total rent to the landlord remains the same, then the $30 is internal to the roommates. However, the writer's initial assignment of the big room via roll was a group decision. Allowing Y to take it for $30 might be seen as the writer making a personal arrangement, which isn't fair to X because he's not part of it. \n\nSo the answer could be A (the writer is in the wrong) because the rent arrangement between writer and Y affects the overall fairness for X, and the writer should have involved X in the negotiation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the initial draw was agreed upon by all and the private arrangement is just how they adjust for room sizes. \n\nBut the key point is that X was indifferent at first, so maybe he didn't care. Now, he's upset because he's paying the same as the writer, who is in a smaller room but getting money from Y. That might be unfair. However, if the total rent is split equally, and the writer is receiving $30 from Y, that's part of a private agreement. But in a shared apartment, all roommates usually agree on the rent split. If the writer is effectively lowering their own rent by getting $30 from Y, then the total rent paid by the roommates is the same, but the writer is not actually paying the landlord less; they are just receiving money from Y, which could be considered a personal loan or something else. That might not be fair to X, who is still paying the same as before but the writer is getting a financial benefit. \n\nSo, the writer might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the negotiation, even though X didn't initially care. The deal between writer and Y changes the rent structure in a way that disadvantages X. Therefore, the answer is A. But the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the initial agreement was that the big room was assigned via a random draw, and then Y wanted to take it over by paying the writer, that's a private agreement between the two. As long as the total rent to the landlord is covered, and the others (X) are still paying the same as they originally agreed, then the writer isn't scamming. However, if the writer is receiving $30 from Y without the landlord's knowledge, that's a problem because the landlord's agreement is with all roommates. The writer should not be charging Y extra unless it's part of the official rent split. \n\nIn that case, the writer is in the wrong because they are creating an internal rent adjustment that isn't agreed upon by all roommates. The original agreement was about assigning the room via a roll, but the financial aspect wasn't addressed. So the writer accepting money from Y without involving X could lead to an unfair split. Therefore, the answer is A. But the user says they think the writer is not in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider whether the writer is allowed to negotiate with Y. If the group agreed on the rooms but didn't adjust the rent, perhaps the writer and Y can adjust their own payments. But X is now affected because his rent is the same as the writer's, who has a smaller room. So all roommates should agree on the rent split. The writer should have included X in the discussion when Y wanted to switch, because changing the room allocation without adjusting the overall rent structure properly would be unfair to X. So the writer is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the financial arrangement, even if X was indifferent before. Therefore, answer A.\n"
