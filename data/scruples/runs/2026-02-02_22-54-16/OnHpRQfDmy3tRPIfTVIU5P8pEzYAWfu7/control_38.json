Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room.\n\nFirst, they moved in together, and before moving, the author, X, and Y all discussed who gets the bigger room. The author wanted it, Y wanted it too. They tried to decide randomly, and the author won. Then Y came back after three days and offered to pay $30 extra rent to swap. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays more.\n\nNow, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal. The author's argument is that they had a random selection first, but then Y offered to pay more to switch. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by accepting the $30.\n\nSo, is it fair for the author to charge $30 to give up the big room? Let's consider roommate agreements. Usually, if there's a fair way to distribute rooms, like random selection or bidding, it's acceptable. The initial method was random, so the author had a legitimate claim. Then Y approached the author directly and offered to pay more, which the author accepted. \n\nBut the problem here is that X wasn't involved in the initial agreement. X might feel that the room allocation isn't fair because two people are paying different amounts. If the room is bigger, maybe the rent should be adjusted. However, the original deal was between the author and Y. X wasn't part of the negotiation, so he might not have agreed to that arrangement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the room is bigger, maybe there's an expectation that the rent is split accordingly. But the author and Y agreed on a private arrangement without involving X. If the total rent is fixed and the author is getting $30 less, X might feel that's unfair. However, the author didn't force the deal on X; it was a mutual agreement between the author and Y. \n\nBut if all three roommates are splitting the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement could create an unfair advantage. However, if the author is charging Y extra to compensate, maybe the rent is adjusted for the room size. \n\nThe key point is whether the initial agreement allowed for such a private arrangement. If the random selection was supposed to be the final decision, then the author giving up the room for money might be acceptable. But if the room allocation should be agreed upon by all roommates, then the author didn't involve X, which could be a problem.\n\nIn many cases, room allocations and rent splits should be agreed upon by all parties. Since X wasn't part of the deal, he might feel it's unfair. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't include X in the decision, even if the initial agreement was fair. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider X's input when making the deal with Y, leading to an unequal distribution that affects X.\n"
