Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for essentially charging a roommate an extra $30 a month to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, the apartment was shared by three people, with three rooms. The big room is 40% larger. Initially, they decided to randomize who gets the big room, and the author won. Then, after a few days, the roommate Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30/month more. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room but pays extra, making the author's rent effectively $30 less.\n\nNow, roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. X claims the author is scamming him. So the question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nLegally, unless there's a lease agreement that specifies room assignments and rent splits, roommates often have to agree on terms. The author and Y made a private agreement that they both agreed to. Since X wasn't part of that initial negotiation, he might feel left out. However, the author didn't make X part of the deal, and the original agreement was between Y and the author. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the total rent is split equally among the three, and the author is effectively paying less because Y is covering the difference, that might seem unfair to X. The author isn't actually reducing the total rent; they're just redistributing it. If the lease requires equal splits, then the author might be at fault for not getting X's consent. However, if it's a roommates' agreement where each can negotiate their own terms, then the author might be in the right.\n\nBut the key point is whether the arrangement is transparent. If X was aware of the agreement and the rent structure, maybe he's just upset. If the author and Y kept it secret, that could be a problem. But the scenario says they had a public agreement. The issue is fairness. The author is charging Y more to switch, but since the big room is more valuable, maybe that's fair. However, X is in a smaller room and the author is paying less, which might be seen as unfair. \n\nIn most roommate situations, it's common to split the rent equally unless there's a specific agreement. If the author and Y agreed to a different split, but didn't inform X or get his consent, that could be problematic. But since the author and Y made the deal and X wasn't part of it, the author might be in the right as long as the total rent paid by all is correct. However, the perception of fairness is important here. If X feels he's being treated unfairly, the author might be seen as inconsiderate, even if not legally wrong.\n\nSo the answer is B for no, the author is not in the wrong, but the reasoning is a bit nuanced. The agreement between Y and the author was mutual, and if the total rent is covered, then it's their arrangement. X's grievance is about perception, not legality. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
