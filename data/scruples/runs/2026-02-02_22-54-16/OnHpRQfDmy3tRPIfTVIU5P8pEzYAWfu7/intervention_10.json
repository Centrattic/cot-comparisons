Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for 'scamming' their roommate. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% larger. The author wanted the big room and asked the other two, X and Y. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author suggested either random selection or a bidding process. Y thought bidding unfair due to income differences, so they rolled a random number generator, and the author won. \n\nThen, after three days, Y changed his mind and offered to pay $30/month for the big room. The author agreed, so now Y has the big room and the author gets $30 less rent. Now X is upset because he thinks it's unfair that the author is paying less for the same room size, even though he (X) didn't get involved in the process.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The initial allocation was agreed upon by Y and the author via a random method. \n2. Y later changed his mind and offered payment to swap, which the author accepted. \n3. X wasn't part of these decisions and now feels wronged.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial process was fair between Y and the author. Y was the one who argued against a bidding system, so the random selection was agreed upon. Then, Y's request to swap with a payment was a new agreement. The author didn't force this; Y initiated it. X wasn't involved in the original arrangement, so his grievance seems to be about the unequal rent distribution. But if all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, then the author's arrangement to take $30 less might unbalance that. However, the problem statement mentions that the author is paying $30 less, implying that X and Y are paying the same, but the author is paying less. Wait, actually, if Y is paying $30 to the author, does that mean the total rent is split as Y pays more, and the author gets some money back? Or is the author reducing their own share?\n\nThe original question says that the author said \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room.\" So Y pays $30 to the author each month. That would mean Y is effectively paying $30 more per month than the author. If the total rent is split equally among all three, then each should pay 1/3. But if Y is paying $30 extra to the author, that might mean that the author is not paying their share, which could affect X's perception of fairness. However, the original agreement between Y and the author was to compensate for the room size difference. If the room size is bigger, maybe the rent should be adjusted. But X didn't participate in that agreement, so he feels left out.\n\nSo, the issue is whether the author should have included X in the arrangement. If the room allocation and rent adjustments are supposed to be decided collectively, then the author didn't consult X, leading to his upset. However, initially, X didn't have a preference, so maybe the author and Y resolved it between themselves. But after the swap, the author's rent is lower, which affects how X perceives the fairness of the rent split. If the total rent is split equally, then the author's lower payment might be seen as unfair to X. Alternatively, if the room sizes affect the rent, maybe the total rent should be adjusted accordingly, but that wasn't the original setup.\n\nIn a typical roommate situation, if one person takes a larger room, they might pay more rent. The initial random selection might not account for that. Then Y, wanting the bigger room, offered to pay extra, which the author accepted. But without involving X, who might also be affected by the rent distribution. However, X's complaint is about the author getting a better deal. If the total rent is fixed, and Y is paying more to the author, then X's share might be higher, but the problem statement isn't clear on how the rent is divided overall.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were based on agreements between themselves and Y, with X not involved. X's complaint is about fairness in rent division, which the author might not have considered. However, the author didn't force X into the agreement, and X didn't express interest in the big room. The author tried to resolve a conflict between Y and themselves, which was fair at the time. X's anger now seems to stem from not being included in the decision, but unless the original agreement required all three to agree, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the overall rent distribution is supposed to be equal among all three, then the author's arrangement with Y could be causing an imbalance that affects X. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the initial room allocation and rent adjustments require consensus among all roommates. If the author and Y could agree without X's input, then the author isn't at fault. If the arrangement should have been discussed with X, then the author is at fault. Since the problem states that X didn't care initially, but now feels wronged, it's possible that the author should have considered X's input when adjusting the rent. However, since X didn't have a preference and didn't participate in the original allocation, the author might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the rent adjustment affects X's share (e.g., if the total rent is split equally, and Y is paying more to the author, making the author's effective share lower), then X's complaint is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they resolved the initial conflict between themselves and Y, and X wasn't involved. However, if the overall rent distribution is now unfair to X due to the arrangement, the author could be at fault. But based on the information given, since X didn't express interest and the initial agreement was between Y and the author, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
