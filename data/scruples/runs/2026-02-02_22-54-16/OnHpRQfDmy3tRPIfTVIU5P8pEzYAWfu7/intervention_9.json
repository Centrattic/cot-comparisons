Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking money from their roommate to switch rooms. So the apartment has three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. Initially, they all had to decide who gets the big room. The author wanted it, and their roommate Y also wanted it. Y said it wouldn't be fair to let the highest bidder get it because the author has a higher income. So they flipped a coin online, and the author won.\n\nBut then after three days, Y came back asking for the room because he needed more space for his bed. The author agreed to let Y have the room if he pays $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because the author is paying less rent even though they have the same size room. X is accusing the author of scamming him.\n\nHmm. So the original agreement was a lottery to decide who gets the big room. The author won, but then let Y have it with a financial compensation. The issue is whether this compensation is fair and if the author should have involved X in the decision.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, all three were supposed to decide. The author and Y agreed on a coin flip, which X didn't mention. Maybe X didn't care about the room sizes? Or maybe he was okay with the initial decision. But when Y approached the author, the author made a deal that affects the rent split. If the original agreement was that the big room is allocated via a fair method (coin flip), then the author had the right to it. But then, by selling the room to Y, they might be violating that initial agreement.\n\nAlso, in roommate agreements, if there's a shared rent, the way the rent is split usually depends on the arrangement. If the big room is supposed to cost more, then perhaps the original plan was to have a fixed amount, but here the author adjusted it after winning the coin flip. Maybe the author and Y arranged this without considering how it affects X's perception of fairness.\n\nX's argument is that it's unfair because he and the author have the same size room but the author is paying less. If the rent was split equally before, but now the author is getting a discount for their room, that might not be fair to X. The problem is that the author and Y made a private agreement without considering that X might be entitled to a say in how the rent is divided. \n\nBut if the original coin flip was the method to assign rooms, then maybe the author had the right to the big room and could negotiate its use. However, if the rent structure is based on room sizes and the author is now effectively getting a smaller room for a lower rent, that could be seen as exploiting the system. The author might be in the wrong if the initial agreement didn't account for possible changes and everyone expected equal splits regardless of room size. \n\nAlternatively, if the initial coin flip was just about allocation, but the rent was supposed to be adjusted based on room size, then the author and Y's arrangement could be fair. However, the author didn't inform X about the deal, which may have caused the problem. So maybe the author should have discussed the rent split with X when making the deal, ensuring that all room sizes are accounted for in the rent. \n\nBut the author's main point is that they wanted the room too, so they accepted a lower rent to let Y have it. The problem is that X feels left out and that the author is profiting from it. If the group had agreed that the big room would cost more, and the author is now paying less for a smaller room, then it's a valid concern. However, the initial setup didn't mention rent adjustments for room sizes, so maybe that's a missing part. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong if the rent was supposed to be equal regardless of room size, but since they adjusted the rent based on the room's size through a private agreement, maybe not. But the key issue is whether the other roommates (especially X) were part of the rent agreement. If the rent was divided equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y could be unfair because it's not equal. However, if the rent was adjusted based on room size, then the author's deal with Y is fair. \n\nSince the original scenario doesn't mention an adjusted rent for room sizes, the initial coin flip allocation might not have considered that. The author and Y's deal changes the rent split based on room size without X's input. Therefore, X is upset because he's stuck paying the same as the author, even though the author is in a smaller room. The author might have acted unilaterally, not considering that the rent structure affects others. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the rent adjustment, leading to an imbalance. But if the initial agreement was to assign the room by chance and then the author and Y decided to adjust the rent, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe answer likely depends on whether the roommate group had a prior agreement about room sizes affecting rent. Since they didn't, the author's action of accepting less rent for a smaller room could be seen as creating an unfair situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not considering the overall fairness to X.\n"
