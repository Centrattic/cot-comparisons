Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for charging their roommate $30 a month to switch rooms. The setup is that there were three roommates, two smaller rooms and one bigger one. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. They decided to flip a coin (using a random generator), and the author won. But then Y wanted to switch, so they agreed that Y could have the big room if he paid $30 extra each month.\n\nNow, roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent. The key question is whether the author did something wrong by making that deal with Y. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They all moved in together, and the author and Y both wanted the big room. They used a random method to decide, which seems fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author offered a solution: Y pays $30 more, and the author gets less. That seems like a mutual agreement between two parties. \n\nX's argument is that the author is scamming him by getting a better deal. But X didn't participate in the initial decision about the big room. The original arrangement was between the author and Y. Unless X was part of the initial agreement or there's a prior understanding that all room assignments and rent splits are decided collectively, the author might not be at fault. \n\nHowever, if the roommates had an unspoken agreement that all room assignments and rent splits are collective decisions, then the author might be in the wrong by making a private deal with Y. But in many roommate situations, individual negotiations are common, especially when rooms differ in size and cost. If the original rent split wasn't adjusted for room sizes, the author's arrangement with Y could be seen as a way to balance it out, which might be fair.\n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The total rent is being split among all three, so if Y is paying $30 more to the author, that might not actually change what Y pays to the landlord. If the total rent is split equally, then Y's extra $30 is going to the author, not reducing the overall rent. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is getting $30 from Y. That could be seen as unfair to X because the total rent isn't adjusted. However, if the original rent was split equally regardless of room size, then the author and Y's arrangement is a side deal. \n\nBut the problem is that X didn't agree to this side deal. If the author and Y made an agreement that affects X's financial burden, that could be a problem. However, if the total amount each roommate pays to the landlord remains the same, and the $30 is just a private transfer between Y and the author, then X's share isn't affected. Unless the author is using the $30 to lower their own share of the rent, which would mean the total rent is being adjusted, but that's not clear. \n\nIf the original rent was split equally, and the author and Y's arrangement doesn't change the overall rent paid by each person, then X isn't directly affected. But if the author is effectively reducing their own rent by $30, then X would have to cover that difference, making X pay more. The description says the author said \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. If the author is getting $30 from Y to switch rooms, but the total rent each pays to the landlord remains the same, then it's a private agreement. However, if the author is reducing their own rent by $30, then Y would have to cover that, which would mean Y pays more to the landlord, and the author pays less. In that case, X's share would effectively increase because the total rent is being redistributed. \n\nThe key here is whether the $30 is a transfer between Y and the author (so total rent paid by each remains the same) or if it's part of a new agreement where the total rent is adjusted. If it's the former, then X isn't directly affected. If it's the latter, then X might have a point because the arrangement changes the rent distribution without his consent. However, without clear communication, the author and Y could be within their rights to make a side deal as long as the overall rent paid by each to the landlord is agreed upon. \n\nAlso, considering that the initial room assignment was determined by a random draw, and then a mutual agreement was made between the author and Y to switch with a financial component, unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments and rent splits require consensus, the author might not be at fault. X's issue is that he's not getting the same deal, which is a common grievance in shared living situations. \n\nIn summary, unless there's a pre-existing agreement that requires all room and rent decisions to be collective, the author isn't in the wrong. The arrangement between the author and Y is a mutual agreement that doesn't directly increase X's financial burden unless the total rent is being adjusted. If the total rent per person remains the same, then X's complaint might be more about fairness in room size than in rent. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong)."
