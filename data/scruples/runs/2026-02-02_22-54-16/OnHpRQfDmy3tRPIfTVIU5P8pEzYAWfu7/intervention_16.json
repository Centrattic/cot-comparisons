Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for arranging a room swap with rent adjustment without consulting their roommate X. \n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates. Initially, they all agreed to a random draw for the larger room, which the author won. Then, after a few days, roommate Y wanted the big room and offered to pay $30 more each month. The author agreed, so Y took the big room and pays the extra.\n\nNow, X is upset because he feels it's unfair that the author is paying less rent for the same size room. The key points here are how the room assignments and rent were decided. \n\nWhen they first moved in, the author and Y used a random draw to determine the big room. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they negotiated a private agreement. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. The problem is that X didn't agree to this arrangement. If the total rent for the apartment is split equally among the three, but the author is effectively paying less because Y is covering $30, that creates an imbalance. However, if the rent is split based on room size, maybe it's different. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the main issue is fairness in how the rent is divided. If the apartment's total rent is split equally each month, but the author's room is smaller and Y's is bigger, then the current arrangement might be unfair. However, if the author and Y have a side agreement where Y pays extra to the author, that could balance things out. But since X wasn't part of that agreement, he might feel it's unfair because he's still paying the same as the author, even though the author's room is smaller.\n\nAnother angle: when they moved in, the initial agreement was random assignment. Then, after the draw, the author gave up the big room for $30/month. If the original rent per person was based on room size, then maybe the author is just getting compensated for the better room. But if the rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y could be seen as exploiting a loophole to get a financial benefit without considering X's share.\n\nThe problem is that X wasn't involved in the negotiation. The author made a private deal with Y without including X, which might not be fair to X. Even if the author intended to balance things out by receiving $30 from Y, if the total rent remains the same and X is paying his share without knowing that the author is getting extra from Y, it could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the original agreement between the author and Y was fair and X wasn't part of the initial agreement, then maybe not. But by not informing X about the arrangement and keeping the $30 from Y, which effectively makes the author pay less than X (if the rent is split equally), that could be the issue. X might feel that the author is gaining an unfair advantage by not sharing the extra money from Y, or that the rent structure isn't adjusted properly. \n\nAlternatively, if the total rent is split equally among all three, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, that means the author's personal payment is lower. If that's the case, then X is paying the same as the author's total, but the author is getting an extra $30 from Y. That could be seen as unfair because the author is effectively being paid more than the others for the same total rent. \n\nBut maybe the rent is split based on room size. If the big room is more expensive, and Y is paying the extra $30 to the author, then it's fair. However, if the original rent split didn't account for room size, and the author is now adjusting it privately with Y without X's input, that could be problematic. \n\nThe core issue is whether the author's arrangement with Y is transparent and fair to X. Since X wasn't part of the original negotiation and is now upset, the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision-making process. Even if the initial arrangement between the author and Y was fair, keeping X out of the loop could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they made a private arrangement without considering X's perspective and the overall fairness of the rent distribution among all roommates.\n"
