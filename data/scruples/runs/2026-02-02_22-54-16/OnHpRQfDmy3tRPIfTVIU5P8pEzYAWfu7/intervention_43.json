Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and rent.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) and Y wanted the big room. X didn't care. They decided to use a random number generator, and Z won. So Z took the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back saying they need the big room for their bed and offers to pay $30 extra monthly for it. Z agrees, so Y gets the room and pays $30 more to Z. Now X is upset because Z and X have the same size rooms, but Z is paying $30 less. X thinks Z is scamming him.\n\nSo the question is, is Z in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial assignment: using a random generator seems fair. Y didn't like that and wanted to switch, so they offered to pay for it. Z agreed to the payment. That seems like a mutual agreement. But then X is upset because he's paying the same as Z, who has a bigger room but now Z is paying less? Wait, no. Wait, the original rent split is not clear. The apartment's total rent is split how? If all three split the rent equally, then each pays 1/3. But if Z was in the bigger room, maybe they were paying more? But the story says that Y offered to pay $30 extra to Z to switch. So maybe the original arrangement was that each roommate pays their share of the total rent, and the room sizes might have been considered in the rent split. But the story doesn't mention that. The author and Y decided that the big room would go to the winner of the random draw, but maybe the rent was split equally regardless of room size. If that's the case, then Z was getting a bigger room for the same rent as the others. Then when Y wants to switch, Z is getting $30 from Y to give up the big room. So now Y is paying more to have the bigger room, but Z is getting $30 to move. But X is upset because he's still paying the same as Z, but Z is getting $30 from Y. Wait, does that mean Z is effectively paying less total rent? If the total rent is split equally, then each person's base rent is the same. If Z is getting $30 from Y, then Z's net rent is their base minus $30, while X's is their base. So X is paying more than Z? Wait, no. If Y is paying Z $30, then Y's total is base + $30, Z's is base - $30, and X is paying base. So Z is actually paying less than X and Y. But X is upset because he's paying the same as Z did before, but now Z is paying less. However, Z is in a smaller room now. So X is in a same-sized room as before, Z is in a smaller one, but Z is getting money from Y. X might feel that the rent should be adjusted based on room size. Maybe the initial setup didn't account for room size differences, leading to inequity. But the author and Y decided to settle it with a random generator and then a private agreement. The problem is that X wasn't part of that agreement and now feels left out. Did the author have the right to make that deal with Y without consulting X? The original agreement was between Z and Y. X didn't express interest in the big room, so maybe they weren't part of the negotiation. But if the total rent is split equally, and the big room is worth more, maybe the initial split was unfair to start with. But the author and Y resolved that by having a contest and then a payment. However, if the payment from Y to Z is a private arrangement, then the total rent paid by each person is: Y pays more, Z pays less, and X pays the same. But X is also in a same-sized room as before. So X is paying the same as before, but Z is paying less. That might seem unfair to X if he's comparing his payment to Z's. But why would X care? Unless the rent was supposed to be adjusted based on room size. If the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then maybe it's not Z's fault to have a side agreement. But if the room sizes affect the rent, then maybe the initial setup was wrong. The key here is whether the initial rent split was fair. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the rent should have been adjusted accordingly. But the author and Y decided on a random draw, and then a side payment. If the others didn't have a say in that, then maybe X feels left out. However, X didn't want the big room initially, so maybe he's not entitled to be involved. The problem is that the side payment between Z and Y changes the effective rent paid by each, leading to X paying more than Z, even though X's room is the same size as Z's. That's the crux. If the total rent is split equally, and Z is getting money from Y, Z's net is less than X's. So X is effectively paying more for the same room. That's the issue. But is that the author's fault? The author made a deal with Y, not knowing that X would be upset. The question is whether Z acted in bad faith. If the initial arrangement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then maybe Z and Y's side deal is unfair to X. But if the room sizes were supposed to affect the rent, then maybe the initial setup was wrong, and Z's deal is just trying to fix that. The problem is that the original agreement didn't account for room size. So maybe Z is in the right because they had a fair process (random draw and then a private agreement), but X is upset because the side payment affects the perceived fairness. Alternatively, Z might be at fault for creating an unequal payment system without considering the overall arrangement. But if everyone agreed to split rent equally regardless of room size, then Z and Y's deal is a private arrangement and not necessarily unfair. The answer might depend on whether the original rent split was adjusted for room size. Since the story doesn't mention that, it's ambiguous. However, in many roommate situations, if rooms are of different sizes, the rent is split accordingly. If that wasn't done here, then maybe Z and Y's deal is a way to account for that, but without informing X. But X wasn't part of the initial discussion about the big room. So the author's actions might not be in the wrong, as they made a deal with the person who wanted the room. But X's grievance is valid because the side payment creates an imbalance in their payments. However, unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments and payments must be approved by all roommates, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
