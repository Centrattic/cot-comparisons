Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for making a deal with their roommate Y to swap rooms in exchange for $30 a month. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, there were three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. The user (let's call them Z) wanted the big room. Initially, Y wanted it too, but when Z suggested a bid or a random draw, Y argued against a bid because of income differences. So they did a random draw, and Z won. That seems fair.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. Z offered a deal: Y could take the room if they paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and feels Z is getting a better deal by paying less. X claims Z is scamming them.\n\nThe key points here are whether the original agreement was fair and if Z had the right to negotiate a swap. Since the initial allocation was via a random draw, which Y agreed to, Z's right to the room was determined then. When Y later wanted the room, Z had the option to negotiate. Since Y was willing to pay $30 more, the swap was mutually agreed. X wasn't part of that initial agreement, so his grievance is about the unequal rent split, but he wasn't involved in the room allocation. Unless the original agreement specified that all room assignments and rent splits had to be approved by all roommates, Z's actions might be within their rights.\n\nHowever, roommates often have unspoken understandings about fairness. If the total rent is split equally, but one roommate is effectively paying more for a larger room, others might feel it's unfair. But if the deal was that Y pays an extra $30 to Z, and Z reduces their own rent, that's a private agreement. However, if the total rent is fixed, perhaps the extra $30 is a contribution to Z, which would make the total rent split unequal. If the original arrangement was that everyone pays the same, then Z is effectively getting more money, which could be seen as unfair to X. But if the agreement was that each person can pay differently based on room size, then it's okay.\n\nThe problem is that the user didn't involve X in the decision. If the roommate agreement was that all room assignments and rent splits require consensus, then Z didn't follow that. But if it was a free-for-all where roommates can negotiate among themselves, then Z isn't in the wrong. Since the user only involved Y and the initial random draw was agreed upon, the deal with Y was between them. X's grievance is about the unequal payment, but unless the original agreement stated that all room assignments must be approved by all, Z isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the issue is that the total rent paid by each isn't equal anymore, which might be against the original terms if they were supposed to split the rent equally. If the apartment's total rent is split equally, but Z is effectively getting $30 more from Y, that creates an imbalance. So whether Z is in the wrong depends on the initial terms of the lease and roommate agreement. If they were supposed to split rent equally regardless of room size, then Z's taking $30 from Y would be against that, making Z at fault. If the lease allows for different room prices, then it's okay. Since the user didn't mention a lease allowing that, it's possible they violated the original agreement, hence AITA would be the user. Alternatively, if the lease allowed for different prices, then not. But typically, in roommate situations, especially when not specified, equal split is assumed. So the user is in the wrong for unilaterally changing the agreement without X's consent, leading to unequal rent distribution. So answer A."
