Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves roommates deciding who gets the bigger bedroom. Initially, they used a random generator because Y didn't want to bid due to income differences. The author won the random draw and got the bigger room. Then Y came back three days later, asked for the room, and the author agreed to let Y have it in exchange for Y paying $30 extra each month.\n\nNow, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a better deal. The key points here are the original agreement and whether X was part of that arrangement. The initial deal between the author and Y was supposed to decide who gets the big room. The author didn't mention that X was involved in this negotiation. So, maybe X wasn't informed about the $30 deal.\n\nThe problem is that the rent is split among all three roommates. If Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, but X isn't aware of this arrangement, it could mean that X ends up paying less than his share, which would be unfair to X. The author is effectively making Y pay more, but if that $30 isn't going to the landlord, but instead to the author, it's not actually reducing X's share. So X is still paying his portion as if everyone is equal, but the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, which might not be right.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author didn't inform X about the deal, which could be why X feels cheated. If the original agreement was between the author and Y, and X wasn't part of that, then X wasn't consulted. However, in a shared apartment, maybe all roommates should have agreed on the room assignments and any monetary arrangements. The author might have gone behind X's back and made a deal with Y, leading to unfairness from X's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, if the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that would mean Y is paying $30 more than X and the author each month. But if the total rent is fixed, then Y's extra $30 isn't actually changing the total they pay to the landlord. So maybe the author is keeping that $30, which is essentially taking advantage of Y, but since the original agreement was with Y, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, X is now upset because he's not part of the deal. \n\nThe confusion is about whether the $30 is part of the rent distribution. If the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X, it's possible that the rent structure isn't fair from X's point of view. The author might have the right to the big room through the initial lottery, but by transferring it for $30, they didn't consider X's position. \n\nIn roommate situations, usually, all parties should agree on room assignments and any additional payments. Since the author didn't involve X in the initial decision-making about room pricing, X might feel that his rights are being ignored. The author might be in the wrong for not including X in the decision or for creating an unequal payment structure without consensus. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve all roommates in the agreement, leading to an unfair situation from X's perspective.\n"
