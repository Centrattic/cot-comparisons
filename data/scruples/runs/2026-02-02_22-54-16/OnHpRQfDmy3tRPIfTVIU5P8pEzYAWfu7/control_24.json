Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by letting their roommate Y pay an extra $30 to switch rooms. The main issue seems to be about fairness and how the rent is divided.\n\nFirst, the setup: three people in an apartment with three rooms, one bigger. Initially, there was a contest to decide who gets the big room, and the author won. Then, after a few days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 more to the author. Now, roommate X is upset because the author is effectively paying less rent per square meter than X, since the big room is more valuable but the author isn't splitting the extra cost.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the agreement among roommates and fairness. When they moved in, they decided to use a random number generator to assign the big room. That seems fair, but when Y wanted to switch, the author allowed it for money. Now X is arguing that this arrangement isn't fair because the author is getting a better deal without considering X's situation.\n\nBut wait, the initial agreement was between Y and the author. X wasn't part of that negotiation. The problem is whether the arrangement between Y and the author affects X's share of the rent. If all roommates split the total rent equally, then the author's room is bigger but they're not paying more. However, the author made a private agreement with Y where Y pays $30 to the author, which effectively makes the author's share lower. But does that affect X?\n\nIf the total rent is split equally, then X is paying the same amount as the author, even though the author's room is bigger. That might not be fair to X. But the author and Y agreed to an adjustment where Y pays the author $30. However, this doesn't change the fact that X is still paying the same as the author. So from X's perspective, the author is getting a better deal. \n\nBut was the initial agreement between the author and Y valid? When they used the random.org, X didn't object. Then when Y negotiated a switch, X wasn't involved. The problem is that the room assignments and rent splits should ideally be agreed upon by all roommates. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they made a private arrangement that affects the overall fairness of the shared living situation without involving X. The total rent split should be adjusted based on room sizes, or the agreement should be made collectively. By having Y pay the author directly, the actual rent division isn't adjusted, leading to X paying more in terms of value. Therefore, the author's action is seen as unfair to X, making them at fault."
