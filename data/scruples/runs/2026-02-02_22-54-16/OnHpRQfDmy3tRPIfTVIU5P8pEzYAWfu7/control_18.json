Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves three roommates with three rooms, one bigger than the others. The author, X, and Y are the roommates.\n\nInitially, before moving in, there's a discussion about who gets the big room. The author and Y both want it. The author suggests either a random draw or paying extra rent. Y argues that a random draw is fair because of income differences, and they go with that. The author wins the random draw and takes the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back asking for the room, offering to pay $30 extra per month. The author agrees, so Y moves into the big room and the author takes a smaller one. Now, X is upset because the author is paying less rent. X claims the author is scamming him by getting a better deal with Y.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the initial agreement between Y and the author, and whether X was involved in any of these decisions. The apartment has three rooms, two smaller and one big. When the author and Y decided the allocation, X might not have been part of that decision. \n\nIf the original agreement was that the big room would be allocated via a random draw, and the author won, then they had the right to occupy it. However, when Y offered to pay extra, the author changed the arrangement. But since X wasn't part of that agreement, maybe he feels that his share of the rent is being affected. But wait, the rent structure wasn't specified. If all roommates are paying equal rent, and the author is giving up part of their rent to Y, that might create an imbalance. \n\nHowever, the author and Y made a private agreement. Unless there was a prior agreement that any changes to room allocation require all roommates' consent, the author and Y could make their own arrangement. But if X wasn't part of that agreement, he might feel it's unfair because he's still paying the same while the author's share is reduced. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not involving X in the decision. If the room allocation and rent adjustments require consensus among all roommates, then the author might be at fault. However, if the initial agreement between the author and Y was acceptable, and X wasn't part of the initial decision-making, then maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nAdditionally, the term \"scamming\" implies some deceit or fraud. The author didn't hide the arrangement from X, but X might not agree with it. But unless there's a rule that all roommates must agree on any room changes or rent adjustments, the author and Y's agreement could be valid. \n\nIn many roommate situations, unless there's a written agreement specifying otherwise, roommates can negotiate their own arrangements. However, if the rent split is equal and the author is effectively reducing their own rent share without consulting X, that could be a point of contention. X might argue that the rent should be split based on room size, but that wasn't the original arrangement. \n\nIn summary, if the initial allocation was done fairly and the author and Y made a private agreement that doesn't affect X's rent or room size, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the agreement affects the overall rent distribution among all three roommates, then maybe the author should have involved X. However, since X wasn't involved in the initial decision, the author might not be obligated to involve him in the subsequent arrangement. So the answer would depend on whether the agreement between the author and Y affects X's rights. If the rent is still split equally among all three, and the author is giving up part of their rent to Y, that could be a problem. But if the author's arrangement with Y is a personal agreement and the overall rent paid to the landlord remains the same, then it's a private matter. The key is whether the agreement violates any prior understandings or affects X's living conditions. Since X is upset about the rent difference, but his room size hasn't changed, maybe it's more about perception. However, in a three-person setup, any private agreement that affects the financial arrangement could be seen as unfair if not discussed with all parties. But unless there's a rule requiring consensus, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
