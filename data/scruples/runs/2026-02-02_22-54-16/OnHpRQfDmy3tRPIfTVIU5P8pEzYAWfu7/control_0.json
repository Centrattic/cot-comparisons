Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nSo, the background: They moved in with two others. There are three rooms, one bigger. Before moving in, they discussed who gets the big room. Y wanted it, the author also wanted it. Y said it wasn't fair to bid because of income differences, so they randomized it and the author won. Then after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the room, leading to an agreement where Y pays $30/month to the author to switch rooms. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is getting a better deal, paying less rent for a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did they have a fair agreement? Was there any deception? Did they follow proper roommate procedures?\n\nThe original agreement was randomized, then a new agreement was made between Y and the author. X wasn't part of that negotiation. X might feel excluded, but if the initial arrangement was mutual between the three, maybe the author should have involved X in the later deal. But if the room assignment was settled by the randomization, and then Y wanted to trade, it's possible that the author and Y made a private agreement. However, since the rent is split among all three, changing the payment structure without consulting everyone might be an issue.\n\nIn roommate situations, fairness is subjective. If the original rent was split equally but now the author is paying less, others might feel it's unfair. If the $30 is essentially a transfer from Y to the author, it might not affect X's share if the total rent is split equally. Wait, the original rent structure isn't clear here. If the apartment's total rent is divided equally among the three, and the author is getting $30 from Y, does that mean the author is actually paying $30 less to the landlord? Or is the $30 a personal payment between them? If it's the latter, then the landlord isn't aware, and the total rent each is paying to the landlord remains the same. But if the author is paying less to the landlord because they're getting $30 from Y, then the others are effectively paying more.\n\nWait, the scenario says \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So the author is getting $30 from Y each month, which they apply to their own rent. That means the total rent paid to the landlord by each person is adjusted. If the author's share is reduced by $30, then either Y is paying the same amount but giving $30 to the author, or Y is paying more. But how is the original rent split? If the rent is split based on room size, then the author was in the bigger room and perhaps paying more. But after the swap, maybe the author is paying less. But the problem is that X isn't part of this arrangement. If the original rent was split equally, then the author is now paying less, and Y is paying more, but X's share remains the same. However, X might feel that he's also contributing equally but not getting the benefit of the bigger room. \n\nSo the issue is whether the agreement between Y and the author is fair to X. If the room size affects rent, then maybe the author was justified in getting more money for the bigger room. But if the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y could be seen as creating an unfair distribution. However, the initial agreement to randomize the room assignment was between all three, so maybe X wasn't involved in the later trade between Y and the author. \n\nIf the author didn't inform X about the agreement, then X might feel left out. But if the author and Y made a mutual agreement, even if X wasn't part of it, maybe it's still their right. However, since the total rent paid by everyone affects X, perhaps the author should have included X in the agreement to ensure fairness. \n\nAnother angle: If the apartment's lease is structured with each roommate paying a certain amount based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might alter that. But if it's a roommates' own agreement to split rent equally, then the author's personal deal with Y could be seen as exploiting that arrangement. \n\nThe key here is whether the original room assignment and rent split had any formal agreement. If the three split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y could be seen as unfair because it effectively changes the rent split without X's consent. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if X is paying the same as the author, but the author is getting the better room for less, X might feel it's unfair. The author might argue that they're just compensating for the room swap, but since X isn't part of that, it's a problem. \n\nSo the answer could depend on the initial agreement. If there was an understanding to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y is against that agreement. If the rent was based on room size, then maybe it's fair. But the scenario doesn't specify the rental structure. \n\nGiven the information, the author went ahead and made a deal with Y without consulting X, leading to X feeling wronged. Even if the author and Y thought they were fair, not involving X might be the issue. So the author might be in the wrong for not including X in the agreement, leading to an unfair outcome for X.\n"
