Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a larger bedroom. The person (let's call them A) moved in with two others, X and Y. Before moving in, they decided to randomly assign the big room, which A won. Then Y, after a few days, wanted the room and offered to pay $30 extra each month for it. A agreed, and now X is upset because he's paying the same as A but A is getting a discount.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether A did something wrong by allowing Y to pay more for the bigger room. Let's break it down. Initially, they had a random draw. Then Y wanted to switch and offered to pay more. A agreed to take $30 less from Y, effectively making Y pay an extra $30. Now X feels it's unfair because he's paying the same as A but not getting any extra.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was random, so no one had a claim. Then Y negotiated a switch. A might argue that since the room was assigned randomly, they can choose to transfer it for a price. But X is upset because he wasn't involved in that negotiation. The question is whether A should have involved X in the price adjustment.\n\nIf the total rent is split equally among all three, then by taking $30 less from Y, A is effectively giving Y a discount. That means Y is paying $30 more than A and X. If the original split was equal, then Y's total payment is higher, but A is getting less. But X is paying the same as A, so he's not happy. \n\nIs there an obligation to involve all roommates in such arrangements? Maybe not, but some roommates might expect that any changes in rent sharing would require consensus. However, since the room assignment was initially determined by a random draw, which Y agreed to, the subsequent transfer between A and Y might be a private agreement. However, if the total rent is split equally, then A adjusting their own payment by taking less from Y could be seen as unfair to X, because X is still paying the same rate as A. \n\nWait, but if the agreement is that each roommate pays a third of the rent, then if Y pays an extra $30 to A, effectively Y is paying more total. But if the original split was equal, then Y's extra $30 is a personal arrangement, not affecting the overall rent. However, if the landlord charges the total rent as a fixed amount split equally, then Y's extra $30 is a side deal between A and Y. That might be okay, but X is upset because he's not getting any benefit. \n\nBut in roommate agreements, sometimes people adjust the split based on room sizes. However, in this case, the rent was split equally, but the room sizes are different. The fact that the bigger room is now being compensated by Y paying A $30 might be a private arrangement. However, if X isn't part of that, he might feel it's unfair because he's paying the same as A but not getting the same discount. \n\nBut the initial assignment was random. So maybe A is within their right to transfer the room if they choose. However, the problem is that the financial arrangement is only between A and Y, which affects how the rent is split. If the total rent is split equally, then Y's extra $30 is a personal payment to A, not part of the official rent. But X isn't involved in that. So X might feel that he's not being treated fairly because the value of the rooms isn't reflected in the rent split. \n\nIn many roommate situations, when rooms are different in size or value, the rent is adjusted accordingly. But in this case, the rent was split equally. So if Y is paying an extra $30 to A, that might be a way to compensate for the larger room's value. But if that's the case, then X is paying the same as A, who has the smaller room. X would be paying less per room size than A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total rent should be adjusted so that the person in the bigger room pays more. But since the original split was equal, and the adjustment is only between A and Y, X is left out. That's probably where X's frustration comes from. \n\nSo, is A in the wrong? It depends on whether the side payment between A and Y is acceptable according to the original agreement. If the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then A and Y's private arrangement might not be fair to X. But if the original agreement allowed for private room exchanges with compensation, then it's okay. \n\nHowever, since the problem arose after X found out, it seems that the original agreement didn't cover this. X wasn't consulted, and he's now upset. The key point is whether all roommates should agree on any changes to the rent split. If the initial agreement was equal split, then changing it unilaterally without consensus could be considered fair or not. \n\nIn many cases, roommates agree that larger rooms are worth more, so rent should be adjusted. If the original split was equal, then A and Y's arrangement creates an imbalance. X is effectively paying less than the room's value because he's in a smaller room. But since the original agreement didn't account for room size, maybe A is in the right. However, the fact that X is upset suggests that the agreement wasn't clear. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Maybe because the author followed the initial random assignment and then negotiated a private deal with Y. But if the total rent is split equally, then X isn't part of that deal. However, if the side payment is only between A and Y, then technically, it's a private agreement. But X is paying the same as A, who is getting a smaller room. So X is overpaying for his room compared to A. That's unfair to X. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement between A and Y affects X's fair share. The original agreement didn't account for room size, so when a private deal is made to compensate for room size, it's not fair to others not involved. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the side payment creates an imbalance that wasn't agreed upon by all parties.\n"
