Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and rent division.\n\nFirst, the apartment has three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. Initially, there was a dispute over who gets the bigger room. The author and Y both wanted it. They considered a random draw or a bidding system, but Y argued about income fairness, leading them to use a random number generator. The author won the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y wanted the room back and proposed the author take a smaller one if Y paid $30 extra rent. The author agreed. Now, roommate X is upset because he's in a similar-sized room but paying more. He's mad at the author for taking money from Y, which he sees as unfair.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are fairness in room assignment and rent distribution. \n\nTypically, when roommates split rent, if one room is significantly larger or more valuable (like the big room), the person in that room might pay more rent. However, in this case, the author got the big room through a random draw, then later allowed Y to have it by taking $30 less from Y's side. Wait, actually, the author said if Y pays $30 of the author's rent, Y can take the room. So the author is effectively getting $30 less from Y, meaning Y is paying less? Wait, maybe the total rent is split three ways. If the author is in the big room and Y moves into it, perhaps the rent is adjusted so that the person in the bigger room pays more. But the author's arrangement is that Y pays $30 of the author's rent. So if the author was paying a higher share for the big room, by taking $30 from Y, maybe the author is getting Y to cover part of their own higher rent. Or maybe the total rent was split equally, and the author is allowing Y to get the better room in exchange for the $30. \n\nBut X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is getting an extra $30, making the author's share lower. So the problem is that the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. Normally, if you have a bigger room, you pay more. However, the author was in the big room for a while, then gave it up for $30 from Y. So maybe the author is now in a smaller room and Y is in the bigger one, but the author is keeping the $30, which could mean that Y's portion of the rent is lower, which X thinks is unfair because he's in a similar room but paying the same. \n\nThe issue here is whether the rent should be adjusted based on room size. If all three were splitting the rent equally, then the person in the bigger room should be paying more. If the author was in the bigger room, they might have been paying less than their fair share. When the author agrees to let Y take the room in exchange for $30, perhaps that's a way to adjust the rent. But if X is paying the same amount as the author, and Y is paying less, that would be unfair to X. \n\nSo the author's arrangement might be creating an imbalance. The problem is that the rent wasn't adjusted based on room value. The author and Y made a private agreement that might not have been transparent to X, leading to his upset. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's usually agreed upon that larger rooms have higher rent. If the author and Y decided to adjust the rent without considering X, that's the problem. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the rent adjustment. The fact that X is paying the same as the author, even though the author is in a smaller room, could be seen as unfair. The author benefits from Y paying less, which affects X's perception of fairness. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not ensuring the rent was split appropriately based on room size and not involving X in the decision. The arrangement between the author and Y created an unfair situation for X, so the author is partially responsible.\n"
