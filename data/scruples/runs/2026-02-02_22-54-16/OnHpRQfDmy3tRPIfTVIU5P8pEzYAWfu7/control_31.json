Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates and the bigger bedroom. The user moved in with two others, X and Y. The big room is 40% larger than the others. Initially, the user wanted it, as did Y. X didn't mind. They decided to use a random number generator, and the user won. Then Y asked to switch, and they agreed that Y would take the big room if he paid $30 extra each month to the user. Now X is upset because the user is effectively paying less rent per square meter than X.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the initial allocation was fair. They agreed to randomize the big room, so it wasn't just given to the user. That seems fair. Then, when Y asked to switch, the user offered to transfer the room in exchange for Y paying $30 extra. The user is getting that money, so they're still paying their original share, but Y is covering the difference. Wait, but the total rent is split three ways, right? If the big room is 40% larger, maybe the user thought it was worth an extra $30, so by taking the $30 from Y, they're effectively making the rent per month equal again? Or maybe the total rent isn't adjusted based on room size. \n\nBut the problem is that X feels like the user is now paying less for the same size room. If all three split the total rent equally, then the user is getting a bigger room for the same cost as the others. But in this case, the user is giving up their right to the big room in exchange for Y paying $30. So the user's total rent isn't less; instead, Y is paying the user $30, meaning the user's share is effectively the same as before? Or is Y paying the user $30 on top of their own rent? Let me recheck the scenario. The user said \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Y would be covering part of the user's rent, so the user's own rent is reduced by $30. That means the total rent paid by the roommates is the same, but the user is paying less than their original share because Y is paying the user. \n\nWait, but if all three were splitting the rent equally before, and the user now gives up the big room and gets $30 from Y, then the user's actual rent contribution is lower. So the user's room is smaller but they're paying less than the others. That would mean the user is getting a better deal, and X is paying the same as before but has a smaller room. So X feels that the user is scamming him because the rent per square meter isn't equal anymore. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on how the original rent was divided. If the original agreement was to split the total rent equally regardless of room size, then the user and Y made a private agreement where Y pays the user to swap rooms. But that would mean the user is receiving $30 from Y, which effectively makes the user's share of the rent lower. If the original rent didn't account for room size differences, then the current arrangement might be unfair to X because he's not part of the swap deal. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the room sizes are different, it's reasonable to adjust the rent accordingly. Since the user and Y decided to swap without considering X's situation, X might feel that he's now paying more per square meter than the user. The user might not be at fault if the original agreement didn't address room size differences, but by accepting the $30, they are creating an imbalance in the shared living costs. \n\nHowever, if the original agreement was that the big room is allocated randomly but rent is split equally, then it's up to the roommates to negotiate their own payments. The user and Y made a deal, but X wasn't involved. X might feel left out or that the rent division isn't fair anymore. The user could be in the wrong if the arrangement with Y affects X's perception of fairness without including him in the decision. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is not in the wrong because they followed the initial agreement (random selection) and then allowed a voluntary exchange when Y wanted it more. Since Y agreed to the $30, the user isn't scamming X directly. But X's frustration is valid if the rent isn't adjusted proportionally to the room size. So the answer might depend on whether the initial setup accounted for room size. If it didn't, and the user is now getting a smaller room for less rent (because Y is paying the user), then the author might be in the right to adjust the payment to balance the deal. But the way it's structured, the user is paying less of the original rent, so maybe that's where the problem lies. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that the user and Y made a side agreement that changed the effective rent per person. If the original rent was split equally, and the user isn't contributing as much because Y is covering part of their rent, then X is right to feel that the user is getting a better deal. The user's action might be considered unfair to X because it's altering the shared cost without including him. So the author could be in the wrong for not considering X's position when they made the swap. But if the user's original rent was already adjusted (like they paid more for the big room), then the swap might be fair. However, the initial setup didn't mention that. The user didn't bid higher, they randomized. So maybe the original rent split was equal and didn't account for room size. \n\nIn that case, the user and Y's deal makes the user's effective rent lower, which is unfair to X. The author might not have considered that when making the deal. So the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the arrangement affects X's share of the rent without his consent. Alternatively, if the user's rent is the same and Y is paying the user extra, but the total rent each pays is the same, then maybe not. Wait, the user says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the user is giving up the big room in exchange for Y paying $30 of their rent. So the user's own rent is now X's original share minus $30? Or is the total rent the same, and Y is paying the extra $30 to the user? \n\nIf the total rent is split equally among all three, and the user's original share was the same as Y and X, then by Y paying the user $30, the user's actual contribution is less. So the user is now paying less than the others for a smaller room, which is unfair. Therefore, X is right to be upset. The author didn't consider that the initial rent split might not be fair when room sizes differ. By allowing Y to pay $30 extra to the user, the author is creating an imbalance. \n\nBut if the initial rent was split based on room size, then maybe the user was paying less for the smaller rooms. However, the scenario states that the big room was \"rightfully mine for the taking\" after the randomization, implying that the original rent wasn't adjusted for room size. So the user was getting a bigger room for the same rent. Then, by swapping, Y is now in the big room and paying the same as before, but the user is in a smaller room and receiving $30, so their effective rent is lower. That's the issue here. \n\nTherefore, the user might be in the wrong because they're benefiting from the room swap (getting a smaller room but paying less rent), while X is stuck in a smaller room without compensation. The author didn't account for the fact that the initial arrangement might be unfair, and the swap exacerbates it. So the answer is A.\n"
