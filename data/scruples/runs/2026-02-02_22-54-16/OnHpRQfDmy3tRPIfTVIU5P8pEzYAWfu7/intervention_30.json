Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about roommates and who should get the bigger room. \n\nSo, the setup is three roommates. The bigger room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the author (person asking) and Y wanted the big room. X didn't care. They were going to decide by random.org, which the author won. But then Y came back after three days, asked for the room, and the author made a deal where Y pays $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is getting a better deal by paying less.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points are: initial agreement via random.org, Y's later request, and the $30 deal. X is mad because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. \n\nWas the initial decision to randomize fair? Since X didn't care, maybe the author and Y had the right to decide between themselves. The author followed through with the random choice. Then Y wanted to switch, so they made a mutual agreement. The author didn't force X into anything. X was part of the initial agreement to randomize and didn't object then. \n\nX's grievance is that he's not getting the same deal. But the author and Y's arrangement is a private agreement. Unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments and rent splits must be approved by all, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't scamming anyone; it's a mutual arrangement between two parties. X's issue is more about envy or feeling left out, but the author didn't wrong him. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They followed through on agreements, and the deal with Y is between two roommates. X's reaction is valid in feeling upset, but it's not the author's fault unless there was a rule about equal rent regardless of room size.\n"
