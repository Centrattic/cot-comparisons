Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and the subsequent payment arrangement.\n\nFirst, before moving in, there was an agreement to randomize who gets the big room. The author won the random draw and took the bigger room. Then, after a few days, roommate Y wanted it more and offered to pay $30 extra each month to switch. The author agreed to this deal. Now, roommate X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting $30 less because of the deal with Y.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the original agreement between the three roommates include how the rent for the bigger room would be handled? Initially, they just decided to randomize. After the author got the big room, Y wanted it and they made a private agreement where Y pays $30 more. X feels left out and thinks the author is scamming him by getting a lower rent without his consent.\n\nLegally and ethically, when roommates have different sized rooms, it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. However, in this case, the initial agreement was a random draw, not a payment based on room size. When Y offered extra to get the big room, the author accepted. But maybe X wasn't part of that agreement, leading to his feeling of unfairness. \n\nIf all three roommates had agreed that whoever gets the big room would pay more, then this would be fair. But since the initial decision was random, and then after the fact, Y and the author made a private deal without including X, X is now paying the same as the author. This could be seen as unfair to X because he didn't have a say in the payment adjustment. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because the agreement between Y and the author affects X's rent structure without his input. Roommate agreements usually require all parties to consent, especially regarding how rent is split. By allowing Y to pay extra for the big room, the author might be creating an unequal share of rent without consulting X, which X is upset about. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the author made a deal that affects the third roommate without including him in the decision. The key is whether the original agreement allowed for such a private arrangement or if all three needed to agree on rent splits based on room size.\n"
