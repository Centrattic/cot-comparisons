Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving into an apartment with three rooms. One room is 40% bigger. The author and roommate Y wanted the big room. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org) and the author won. Then after a few days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 more per month. The author agreed, so Y took the big room but pays $30 extra. Now roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who also has a small room but gets $30 less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, they all agreed on splitting the rent, probably equally. The big room was determined by random, so author got it. Then Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 more. The author agreed. So the author is giving up their right to the big room in exchange for $30/month. \n\nBut X is upset because he didn't get a chance to bid or negotiate. The problem here is whether the author had the right to negotiate the room change without consulting X. If the original agreement was that the room assignments were determined by the random.org, but then after that, someone wanted to change, maybe they should have all agreed on a system for future changes. \n\nBut when Y approached the author, they made a private agreement. So X is now paying the same rent as the author but in a smaller room, while Y has the bigger room and pays more. X feels it's unfair because the author is effectively getting a discount. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider roommate agreements. Typically, if roommates want to adjust rent based on room size, that's common. But in this case, the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X. So X is not part of that arrangement, leading to an imbalance in their shared costs. \n\nThe key point is whether the original agreement allowed for unilateral changes. If the initial split was equal, then any change in room assignments should be discussed with all parties. The author made a deal with Y that affects the overall rent split, which impacts X. Therefore, not consulting X might be the issue. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not including X in the negotiation. If they had adjusted the rent so that everyone's payments were still fair, maybe it would be okay. For example, if Y pays $30 more, and X also adjusts his payment, or the total rent is split considering the different room sizes. But since only Y's payment changed, X is paying more per square foot than the author, which is unfair. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they altered the room agreement without considering all roommates, leading to an unfair distribution of costs for X.\n"
