Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller ones and one bigger. The author wanted the big room, as did Y. Initially, they flipped a random.org coin to decide, and the author got it. Then Y came back after three days and wanted to trade, offering to pay $30 more each month so the author could take that money and give the room to Y. The author agreed. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent by getting the room. X feels cheated and says the author is scamming him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. When they first assigned the rooms, they used a random method because Y thought it was unfair to base it on income. Then Y wanted to trade. The author offered a price. Y agreed. So, the author and Y made a deal. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. X is now upset because he wasn't involved and feels he's paying more. \n\nFirst, the initial random assignment was agreed upon by both Y and the author. X wasn't mentioned as being involved in the initial decision. So the author got the big room fairly through a random method. Then when Y wanted to trade, the author had the right to either accept or reject the trade. Since they did accept, and Y agreed to pay $30 more, that seems like a mutual agreement. \n\nBut X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is getting a better deal. The problem is, X wasn't part of the initial agreement. The author and Y made a deal without X's input. However, unless there was a prior agreement that all room assignments require consensus, the author and Y's deal might be their own business. \n\nBut wait, X is also a roommate. If the rent is split equally among all three, then the author is effectively paying $30 less per month. That could be seen as unfair to X, especially if the room sizes affect the rent. However, the original setup didn't specify that. It's possible that the initial rent division didn't account for room sizes. So when Y took over the bigger room by paying more, that changes the dynamics. \n\nBut the author didn't take money from X. The $30 is from Y to the author. So maybe X feels like he's subsidizing the author because the author is getting a better room for less. However, unless the initial agreement was that room sizes are equal and rent is split equally, the author's choice to take the bigger room for less might not be the author's fault. \n\nThe key here is whether there was an agreement on how to assign rooms and split rent. If the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then maybe the author's deal with Y affects X. But since the author and Y made the deal, and X wasn't part of it, the author might not be at fault. X's anger might stem from the fact that he's in a smaller room and the author is getting a better deal, but unless there was a rule against private deals between roommates, the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have included X in the initial decision. But the author and Y were the ones competing for the room. X wasn't interested in the big room. The author might not have considered X's feelings, but if the initial agreement was between the author and Y, then X's complaint is a bit late. \n\nIn summary, the author acted within their rights to negotiate with Y, given the initial agreements. X's frustration is more about the outcome rather than the process. Unless there's a rule that all room assignments require all roommates' input, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
