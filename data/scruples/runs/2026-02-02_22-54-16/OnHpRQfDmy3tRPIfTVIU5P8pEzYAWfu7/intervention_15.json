Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong in their situation with their roommates.\n\nSo the setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller rooms and one bigger one. The author, X, and Y are the roommates. The big room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author and Y both wanted the big room. Y didn't want to have a bidding war because the author might have a higher income, so they decided to flip a coin or use a random generator. The author won, so they took the big room. Then after three days, Y came back and wanted the room, saying he needed it for his bed. The author agreed to let Y have the room if Y pays an extra $30 each month. X is now upset because he thinks the author is scamming him since he's paying $30 less rent. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the fairness of the initial agreement. They used a random method to decide who gets the bigger room. The author won, so they were in the big room. Then Y came back and wanted it, so they made a deal where Y gets the room but pays an extra $30. That seems like a mutual agreement between the author and Y. However, X isn't part of that deal and is now upset because his rent is higher compared to Y's. But X wasn't part of the negotiation, so perhaps he didn't agree to the extra $30. But the original split of the rent wasn't specified. Maybe the total rent is split equally, but Y is paying more to the author, which makes X's share effectively lower? Wait, if the author is charging Y $30 extra, does that mean the author is keeping that $30, reducing their own rent? Or is the total rent split equally, and the $30 is a separate agreement?\n\nWait, the author says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So if Y pays $30 of the author's rent, does that mean Y is paying $30 more in total? Or is the total rent divided equally, and Y gives the author $30 as a form of compensation? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose the total rent is, say, $1200. Each roommate is supposed to pay $400. But the author is in the big room and Y is in a small one. Then the author gives up the big room to Y in exchange for Y paying $30 of the author's rent. So Y pays $400 - $30 = $370? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the author is charging the $30 extra from Y as a private agreement. So the total rent is split equally among three, each paying $400. But Y gives the author $30 a month for the room, so effectively, Y is paying $430, and the author is getting $30 extra. X is still paying $400. But X feels that he's paying more compared to Y. However, in reality, the total rent to the landlord is still $1200, right? So the $30 is part of a private agreement between Y and the author, not affecting X's share. But X might feel that since Y is in a bigger room, he should be contributing more to the total rent. However, the initial agreement was random, and the author later made a deal with Y. The problem is that the author didn't involve X in this private arrangement. So X isn't part of the $30 deal, but he's paying the same as before. Maybe the issue is that the author is effectively getting a discount by receiving $30 from Y, while X isn't, making X pay more. But if the total rent to the landlord is the same, then the $30 is just moving between roommates. However, from X's perspective, he might think that all three should split the total rent based on room size, but the initial decision was random. The author might be right in their deal with Y since they agreed to it, but X is upset because he wasn't involved. However, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything explicitly unfair; they made a deal with Y. The problem is that X is now upset because of the unequal distribution of rent. But if the total rent to the landlord is split equally, and the author is compensating for the bigger room by getting $30 from Y, then maybe it's fair. However, if the original arrangement was that whoever gets the bigger room pays more, but the author and Y arranged it so Y pays more for the bigger room, but X is paying the same, maybe the author is in the wrong for not making the arrangement include X. Alternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because Y and the author negotiated a private agreement. But X's complaint is that the author is getting a financial benefit that X isn't, which could be seen as unfair. However, the author's argument is that they both wanted the bigger room, and they resolved it randomly. Then Y changed his mind and they made a deal. The author didn't force anything on X. However, if the initial split of rent is based on equal shares regardless of room size, then the author is getting a larger room for less money, which is unfair. But if the $30 is part of a private agreement where Y is paying the author extra for the bigger room, then maybe the total amount the author is getting is fair. But if the author is keeping the $30, then technically, the author is getting a discount on their rent share, while X is not. But since the author is in the bigger room, maybe they should be paying more, not less. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. The key points are: 1. The initial room assignment was random. 2. The author later transferred the big room to Y for $30/month. 3. The author is now paying less rent than Y, which X is upset about. If the total rent is split equally, but the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author's net payment is lower, which could be seen as unfair to X. However, if the author is using the $30 to offset their own rent, then technically, the total amount paid by Y is higher, but the author is not paying their share of the total rent. Wait, let's break it down numerically. Suppose total rent is $1200. Each should pay $400. The author is in the big room, paying $400. Y comes in and wants the big room. They agree that Y pays $30 of the author's rent. So the author effectively pays $370, and Y pays $400 + $30 = $430. But X is still paying $400. So the author is getting the big room for less, which might not be fair. Alternatively, maybe the $30 is a separate payment from Y to the author, not affecting the total rent. So total rent is still $1200. The author receives $30 from Y, so author's net is $370, but the $30 is just a private transaction. X is not involved. But X is paying $400, same as before. The problem is that X might feel that since the author is in a bigger room, they should be paying more, but they're actually paying less due to the private agreement. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because they didn't adjust the rent to account for room size, leading to an unfair distribution. Alternatively, the initial agreement was random, and the author's arrangement with Y is a separate negotiation. The author isn't in the wrong because they made a deal with Y, and X wasn't part of that. However, if the room sizes affect the rent split, then maybe the author should have adjusted the rent to be fairer from the start. The key here is whether the room size should affect the rent split. If the room sizes are different, then perhaps the rent should be split based on room size. The author and Y decided randomly, but if Y later wanted to pay more for the bigger room, that's up to them. However, if the author is in the bigger room but paying less than Y, that might be unfair to X, but since X wasn't part of the deal, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the author didn't account for room size in the initial arrangement, leading to an unfair situation when the room sizes differ. This is a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because they made a private agreement with Y, but X's complaint is valid because the rent distribution isn't fair relative to room size. However, the author's actions were not malicious; they just negotiated with Y. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for criticism in how the rent is handled. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't account for room size in the rent split. But the initial agreement was random, so perhaps that's acceptable. The key is whether the author's arrangement with Y unfairly benefits them at X's expense. Since X isn't part of the agreement, the author isn't directly wrong, but X's feelings are valid. However, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't breaking any rules; they just made a deal with Y. So the answer is B.\n"
