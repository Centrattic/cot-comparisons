Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates and the big room. The author moved in with two others, X and Y. They had a lottery to decide who gets the bigger room, and the author won. Then Y asked for the room and offered to pay $30 extra a month. The author agreed, so Y got the room and pays 30$ more. Now X is upset because he thinks it's unfair that he and the author have the same room size but the author pays less.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there was any agreement upfront about how to handle the big room. The author and Y used a random generator first, but then after Y wanted it, they made a deal. The key here is whether X was part of that agreement or if it was agreed that such deals could be made. The original question was about the fairness of the deal and whether it's acceptable. \n\nIf there was no prior agreement that any deals about room assignments would require all roommates' consent, then the author might be in the right. But if the initial arrangement was supposed to be fair to all parties by having a random selection, then changing it without consensus could be an issue. However, the author did make a deal with Y, who wanted the room. The problem is that X wasn't consulted, so he feels he's being treated unfairly. \n\nAnother angle: when they moved in, the initial agreement was to have a random selection. But after the author won, Y came back and wanted the room, so the author and Y made a deal. That deal might not be fair to X because now the author is getting a discount by giving up the room. But the author didn't actually give up the room; they let Y have it in exchange for Y paying 30$ extra. So the author is paying less, not more. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if all three roommates are sharing the rent, and the total rent is split, perhaps the author's agreement to take less rent by allowing Y to pay more could be seen as a way to adjust the payment. But if the original split was equal regardless of room size, then allowing one person to pay more for a bigger room might not account for X's situation. \n\nHowever, the author didn't force X into this deal. The initial selection was random, which was fair. Then a mutual agreement between the author and Y was made. Unless there was a rule that any such agreements needed to involve all roommates, the author's actions might be justified. \n\nBut X is upset because he feels the author is getting an unfair advantage. The author is essentially transferring $30 from Y to themselves, which makes X's share relative to the author's lower. If the original rent was split equally, then each roommate pays the same, but now the author is getting $30 less, which might not be fair to X. \n\nWait, but the author says that when Y wanted the room, the author required Y to pay $30 extra to take over the big room. So the total rent might stay the same, but the distribution changes. If the rent is split equally, then the author is effectively getting $30 from Y, which could be seen as a private arrangement. But if the original rent was supposed to be split equally among all three, then this arrangement might not be valid unless all parties agreed. \n\nSo the problem is that the author and Y made a private deal without considering X's input. If the original agreement was that the big room would be assigned via a fair method and then stay that way, then changing it now without X's consent could be unfair. However, the author and Y both wanted the room and found a way to adjust. \n\nIn many roommate situations, room assignments and rent splits are flexible, especially if all involved parties agree. But if the initial agreement was a random selection, then changing it later without consensus could lead to disputes. Since X wasn't part of the deal, he feels he's being treated unfairly. \n\nThe key point is whether the author and Y had the right to make that deal without X's approval. If the initial agreement was that the random selection was final, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the agreement allowed for future negotiations, then it's okay. The original problem states that before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room, and Y wanted it. Then a random selection was done. But after that, when Y offered more, the author agreed. \n\nSo maybe the initial random selection was just a way to assign the room initially, and there was an understanding that it could be changed if someone offered more. If that's the case, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the original agreement was that the room assignments were fixed once decided, then the author might have overstepped. \n\nSince the original post says that Y didn't want to have a highest bidder system because of income differences, and instead went with a random selection. Then later, when Y asked, the author allowed a payment arrangement. The author might have the right to do that if there's no prior agreement against it. \n\nIn conclusion, unless there was an explicit agreement that all room assignments are fixed once decided, the author and Y could negotiate a change. The author isn't scamming anyone; they made a mutual agreement. X's upset is about the fairness of the rent split, but the author didn't involve X in the deal. However, unless the initial agreement required all parties to agree, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
