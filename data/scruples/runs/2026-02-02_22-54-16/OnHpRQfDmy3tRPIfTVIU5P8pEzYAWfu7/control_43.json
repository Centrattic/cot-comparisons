Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. The original decision was made through a random number generator after some discussion. The writer won the big room. Then, after a few days, the other roommate (Y) wanted the big room and offered to pay $30 more in rent each month. The writer agreed. Now, the third roommate (X) is upset because he's paying the same rent for a smaller room and thinks the writer is scamming him.\n\nSo the main question is whether the writer did something wrong by allowing Y to pay extra for the big room, leading to X feeling shortchanged. \n\nLet me think about roommate agreements. Typically, if rooms are different sizes, it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. But in this case, the initial allocation was done via a random draw, which might have been fair at the time. Then, the writer allowed Y to take the big room by paying an extra $30. The problem arises because X wasn't part of that agreement and now feels it's unfair.\n\nBut wait, when the writer and Y made the deal, was X consulted? The writer says they didn't take it up with X. So, if all three roommates were splitting the rent equally, and the writer is now getting an extra $30 from Y, that would effectively reduce the writer's share of the rent. However, since the rent is split three ways, maybe the writer isn't actually paying less. Wait, no. If the total rent is fixed, and the writer is getting $30 from Y, that would mean the writer's individual payment is reduced. Let me clarify: suppose the total rent is $X per month, each roommate pays a third. If Y pays the writer $30, the writer's share would be a third less $30. But that might not be the case if the total rent is fixed. Alternatively, maybe the writer is receiving the $30 as compensation for giving up the room. So the total rent each pays remains the same, but Y pays the writer extra. But does that affect X's share? If X isn't involved in the deal, he's still paying his original amount. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the big room is worth more, having someone pay extra for it might be a way to compensate others. However, if the roommate agreement doesn't account for this, it can create inequality. The key point is whether the original agreement allowed for such a private arrangement between two roommates without consulting the third. \n\nIn most roommate situations, any changes to the living arrangements should involve all parties. If X wasn't part of the agreement when Y took over the big room and started paying the extra, then X might feel it's unfair. The writer might have acted without considering X's input. Also, the initial random draw was between the two people who wanted the room, but maybe X should have had a say in the process. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It depends on the initial agreement. If there was no prior agreement on how to handle room size differences, the writer's actions could be seen as creating an unfair situation for X. Even if the writer and Y agreed on the extra payment, not involving X in the decision-making could be problematic. X's argument is that he's paying the same rent as the writer for a smaller room, while the writer is effectively getting $30 more because they're in a bigger room. But since the writer gave up the big room, they should be compensated, but perhaps that compensation should be shared or structured differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X is being unreasonable. If the initial allocation was random, and then a new agreement was made between two roommates without his consent, but it's up to the roommates to negotiate. However, in standard roommate practices, adjusting room assignments and payments should involve all parties to maintain fairness. The writer might have made an agreement that affects X's living conditions indirectly, so X's reaction is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer might be in the wrong because they made a private agreement that affects another roommate's experience without including them in the decision. The fairness of the situation is questionable because the compensation arrangement isn't transparent to all parties. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
