Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and splitting the rent based on room sizes. The apartment has three rooms: two smaller ones and one bigger, 40% larger. Initially, they were going to decide who gets the big room by a random draw, which the author won. But then, after a few days, Y asked for the big room and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y pays an extra $30 each month towards the author's rent. Now X is upset because he also has the same size room as the author, but the author is paying less. X is calling the author a scammer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The author and Y decided to use a random method to assign the big room, and the author won. Then Y wanted to switch, and they came to a mutual agreement where Y pays extra. The key here is that the author and Y made this deal privately. But X wasn't part of that agreement. X was okay with letting Y have the big room because he didn't care at first. Wait, no, actually, the initial setup was that the author and Y were the ones competing for the big room, while X didn't care? Or did X also have a smaller room?\n\nWait, the apartment has three rooms. The author, X, and Y all moved in together. The author asked who wanted the big room, and X said he didn't care, Y wanted it. So the author and Y were the ones deciding between the big room and the smaller ones. The author wanted it too, so they had a contest. The author won. Then, after a few days, Y comes back and wants to switch. The author says if Y pays $30 extra each month, they can switch. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is also in a smaller one but paying less. But X didn't want the big room initially, so maybe he thought he was getting a smaller room, and the author also got a smaller one via random. But the author then let Y take the big room for an extra $30. X is upset because he feels the author is getting an unfair advantage over him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author and Y made a private agreement that benefits both. The author was willing to give up the big room for a financial compensation, which Y accepted. However, X wasn't part of this agreement. X might feel that the author is paying less than him, even though X didn't want the big room. But the author and Y handled the situation between themselves. If the original agreement was that the big room is assigned by random, then the author had the right to it until they decided to let it go. Since the author and Y both agreed to the switch, it's a valid agreement. X's issue is that the author is now in a smaller room but paying less, but maybe X was okay with the random assignment. The problem is that the author didn't involve X in the decision, but maybe X had already accepted the initial arrangement. The author might be in the right because they made a fair deal with Y, but if X was part of the original agreement about room assignments and rent, then maybe the author should have included X in the discussion. However, the original scenario suggests that X didn't care about the big room, so perhaps he wasn't part of the initial decision. The author might not be at fault, but the problem arises because the extra $30 is affecting the rent split between the author and X. If the agreement was that the big room is for the higher bidder, then the author's deal with Y is fair. But if the original agreement was that all rooms are split equally, then maybe the author shouldn't have accepted extra money without including X. However, the initial problem was that the author and Y were both wanting the big room, and X didn't care. So the author and Y resolved it between themselves. X's grievance is that the author is now in a smaller room but pays less. But if X didn't want the big room and the author was assigned a smaller room through random, then X's problem is that the author is paying less than him even though their rooms are the same size. But why would X be upset about that? Maybe because the original idea was that the big room costs more, but if the author is in a smaller room and paying less, X might feel the author is getting a better deal. Wait, but X didn't want the big room. The author and Y decided the big room would go to the one who could pay more, but then Y paid the author $30. So the author's rent is reduced by $30, which might mean that the author is now paying less than X, who is in a similar room. But if the original rent split was supposed to be based on room sizes, then the author should adjust the rent accordingly. However, the author and Y's deal might not have involved X, so X wasn't part of the negotiation. The author might be in the right if the agreement was between two parties, but if the entire roommate situation was based on a shared understanding of rent splits per room size, then the author might have broken that by accepting extra money from Y without involving X. Alternatively, maybe the original rent was split equally, and the author and Y decided to adjust their personal payments outside of that. But X is now paying the same as the author (who is in a smaller room) but X is also in a smaller room. So the author's payment would be less than X's, which is what X is upset about. But if X didn't want the big room, then his room is the same size as the author's, so maybe the author is just being paid by Y to compensate for the room size difference. However, the initial agreement was that the big room would be assigned by random, and the author took it. Then Y wanted to switch, and the author let Y take it for $30/month. The problem is that X wasn't part of this, so X might not have known about the arrangement. If the author's reduced rent is affecting the overall split (e.g., if they all split the total rent equally), then the author is effectively getting $30 from Y to cover their own rent. But if the total rent is split equally, then Y is paying more overall. But maybe X is in a similar room and paying the same as the author (who is in a smaller room), so X is now paying more per room size. The author's action might have disrupted the original rent split agreement. If the original agreement was that the big room would be assigned by random and the rent would be split equally, then after the switch, the author is in a smaller room but paying less, while X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. Wait, but X was already in a smaller room. If the author is now in a smaller room and paying less, then X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. That would mean X is paying more for a similar room, which is unfair. But the author might have been in the same situation initially, but then switched. So X didn't want the big room, but now is upset because the author is getting a better deal. The author's decision to take $30 from Y to switch rooms might have created an imbalance in the rent split. If the original setup was that the big room would be assigned by random, and everyone was to split the rent equally, then the author and Y's private agreement might be a problem because it affects the overall split. For example, if the total rent is $X, and all three split it equally, but Y is now paying the author $30/month extra, the total for each would be different. But maybe the author and Y agreed to adjust their own payments outside of the total rent. If that's the case, then the author is right. But if the total rent was supposed to be split equally, then the author is essentially getting more than their share by taking the $30, which would be unfair. So the key is whether the rent was split based on room size initially. If the original agreement was that the big room is more expensive, then the author was supposed to pay less than Y. But after the switch, the author is in a smaller room and paying less than Y. However, X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. That's the problem. X might feel that the author is now in a similar room as X but paying less, while X can't switch. The author might be in the right if the agreement was between two parties, but the issue is that the third roommate wasn't involved. The author's decision to take money from Y might have created an unfair situation for X. Alternatively, if the original rent was split equally regardless of room size, then the author and Y's deal is a private arrangement, and X's grievance is about the author getting a better deal. But X didn't want the big room, so maybe he's just being envious. The author might not be in the wrong because they made a fair deal with Y, but X's argument is that the author is now benefiting from the arrangement by paying less. So the author is in the right (B) if the deal was between the two who wanted the big room, but maybe in the wrong (A) if the total rent should be split based on room size. However, the original problem was that the author and Y were both wanting the big room, and X didn't care. So the author's deal with Y is a resolution to their own conflict. X's issue is more about the author's rent being less than his, but if the author is in a similar room, that's a problem. The author should have considered X's situation when making the deal with Y. But if X didn't want the big room and the author and Y resolved it between themselves, maybe the author isn't at fault. The answer might be B, but it's a bit tricky. The main point is that the author and Y made a mutual agreement to switch rooms, with the author receiving $30/month from Y. If the original rent allocation was such that the big room's cost was distributed equally, then the author is now in a smaller room but still paying less, which is unfair to X. But if the author and Y had an agreement to adjust their own rent based on room size, then it's okay. Since the author and Y were the ones competing for the big room, and X didn't have a preference, the author might not be in the wrong for making a deal with Y. However, the author should have communicated with X about the new arrangement to avoid misunderstandings. But since X was okay with the initial random assignment, maybe the author isn't at fault. So I think the answer is B.\n"
