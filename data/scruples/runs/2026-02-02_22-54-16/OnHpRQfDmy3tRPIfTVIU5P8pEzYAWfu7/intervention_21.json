Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person they refer to as the author is in the wrong for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room.\n\nSo, the setup: Three roommates in a 3-bedroom apartment. Two smaller rooms and one big room that's 40% larger. When moving in, the author, X, and Y all started with the author wanting the big room. Y initially wanted it but backed out when the author suggested a bid because Y's income is lower. They flipped a coin (or used a random generator) and the author won. Then, after three days, Y changed their mind and asked to switch, offering to pay $30 extra. The author agreed to take $30 less from Y to give up the big room. Now, X is upset because he's in a room of the same size as the author, but the author is paying less.\n\nFirst, I need to check the initial agreement. The author and Y decided to randomize the room assignment after Y didn't want to bid. The author won, so they had a right to the big room. Then Y came back later and offered to pay $30 extra to switch. The author accepted that deal, which means the author is now in a smaller room and Y is in the big one, with Y covering the $30 difference. \n\nX is in another smaller room, but the problem is that X isn't paying less. The author is the one who adjusted their payment, so X's rent remains the same. X is upset because he feels the author is paying less than him. Wait, but the rooms are different sizes. If the big room is 40% larger, maybe the rent is split based on room size? The user didn't mention that the rent was split equally. But according to the story, when they randomized, the big room was \"rightfully mine for the taking,\" which might imply that the initial agreement was to assign the big room through the random draw. Then, after the draw, Y approached the author to negotiate a switch. \n\nSo the author didn't scam anyone. The randomizer was agreed upon initially, and then there's a later negotiation between the author and Y. X wasn't involved in that negotiation. If the rent is split equally among three people, each pays the same regardless of room size. But the author and Y made a deal where the author takes $30 less, so Y would effectively be paying more for the bigger room. X, who is in a smaller room but pays the same as the author, now feels the author is paying less and he's not. However, the total rent for the apartment is split into three parts. The author is just transferring $30 of their portion to Y. So the author is still paying their own share, but Y ends up paying more. \n\nX's grievance is about fairness\u2014why isn't the author splitting the money with him? But the original agreement was between the author and Y. The author didn't promise X the big room or any specific rent split. The problem might be that X wasn't part of the initial decision-making process and now feels left out. However, unless there's a prior agreement that all room assignments and rent splits require unanimous consent, the author and Y could make their own deal. \n\nBut wait, roommates often have a main rent to split. If the total rent is divided equally, then the author and Y's arrangement means that Y is effectively paying the author $30, which isn't part of the main rent. So the author is not paying less of the main rent; they're just receiving money from Y. X is still paying his own share. The confusion here is that X might not understand that the $30 isn't a deduction from the total rent but a private agreement between the author and Y. \n\nIf the main rent is divided equally, each roommate's share is fixed. The author's share is the same as before, but Y is paying the author $30 to switch rooms. So the author isn't reducing their actual rent; they're getting compensation. Therefore, the author isn't scamming the others. The issue is that X is comparing room size to rent paid, thinking that the author is paying less. But the author's rent is the same as X's; the $30 is a transfer between two roommates. \n\nHowever, there's a potential problem if the initial randomization was supposed to be the final decision. The author and Y agreed to a new arrangement after the random draw. If X was part of the initial agreement to randomize, then the author and Y going behind his back might be an issue. But the story says the author and Y randomized, and the author won. Then later, Y asked the author directly. Unless the original agreement required unanimous consent for any room changes, the author and Y could make a new deal. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong if the main rent is split equally, and the $30 is a private agreement. But if the author is indeed paying less of the main rent, then that's different. The key detail is that the author is taking $30 less of their own rent, not the total. So the author's total contribution to the main rent is reduced, which makes Y pay more. X, who's in the same size room as the author, is now paying the same as the author's reduced share. That's not fair from X's perspective because he's in a smaller room but pays the same as the author. \n\nWait, maybe the total rent is split equally regardless of room size. So each roommate pays 1/3 of the total. If the author and Y switch, and the author takes $30 less of their share, that would mean the author's portion is reduced by $30, and Y's portion is increased by $30. But X's portion remains the same. So X ends up paying the same as the author, even though he's in a smaller room. That's a problem. The author is essentially giving up part of their own share to Y, which affects X's perception of fairness. \n\nBut the author's action was based on an initial agreement to randomize, which they followed. Then, when Y approached, the author decided to make a deal. The problem is that the author and Y shouldn't have changed the arrangement without X's agreement. If the rent split is supposed to be equal, and the author is taking less, that could be seen as unfair to X. However, the author is only adjusting their own payment. If the author is the one who says \"you can have the big room if you pay me $30,\" that's a private agreement. X's issue is that he wasn't part of the deal and now feels the author is getting away with something. \n\nIn many situations, roommates can adjust their rent if they all agree, but in this case, only two roommates agreed. If the author is effectively reducing their own rent, and the total is split such that others are paying the same, then the author is in the wrong because they're creating an unequal split among the three roommates. The original problem was about fairness of room size and rent. By taking $30 less, the author is now paying less than X for the same room size, which is unfair. \n\nSo the correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong because they created an unequal rent distribution without all roommates' consent). But wait, the author is in a smaller room now. If they reduced their own rent by $30, they're now paying less for a smaller room. But maybe the rent is split equally, so each pays 1/3. If the author is taking $30 less, but still paying the same total, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the details.\n\nThe author says \"you can have the room instead of me\" if Y pays $30 of the author's rent. So the author is effectively transferring part of their rent to Y. If the total rent is split into three parts, and the author is now taking their share minus $30, and Y is paying their share plus $30, then X's share is unchanged. X is in a smaller room but paying the same as the author (who is in a smaller room). So that's fair. But if the author is in a smaller room and Y is in the big room, and the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author's actual contribution is less. However, the total rent for the apartment is still the same. The issue is that the author is now receiving money, which might not be part of the main rent. \n\nBut the problem is X's perception. He's in a smaller room and the author is in a smaller room but the author is taking $30 less. If the main rent is split equally, X is paying the same as the author, but the author is getting extra money from Y. That means the author's net payment is less than X's. So X is paying more than the author for the same room. That's unfair. The author should have involved X in the discussion or adjusted the rent for all three. \n\nSo the answer would be A because the author should have considered all roommates when changing the rent split, even if it's a private agreement. The arrangement between the author and Y affects X's share in terms of perceived fairness. The author is in the wrong for not including X in the decision and creating an imbalance.\n"
