Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are three roommates. When moving in, the bigger room is up for grabs. The writer asks the other two, X and Y, who wants it. Y really wants it, but there's a conflict because the writer also wants it. They consider randomizing or having a bidding war. Y says it's unfair because the writer has a higher income, so they go with a random method (random.org) and the writer wins the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back saying he needs the big room for his bed and offers to pay $30 extra each month for the writer to give up the room. The writer agrees, so Y now has the big room and pays $30 more. Now X is upset because he and the writer have the same-sized room, but the writer is paying less. X thinks the writer is scamming him by getting a better deal without consulting him.\n\nSo the question is: Is the writer in the wrong?\n\nHmm. Let's look at the agreements made. Initially, the big room was allocated through a random method agreed upon by Y and the writer. X wasn't part of that initial decision. Then Y approached the writer with an offer to pay $30/month for the room, which the writer accepted. The key here is whether the writer had the right to negotiate that deal without X's consent.\n\nIn roommate situations, especially when splitting rent, it's common for agreements to be among all roommates. If the writer and Y made a private agreement that affects the rent split, that could be problematic. The original rent split might have been divided equally among all three, assuming the big room was worth more. But by the writer taking the big room for less rent (effectively getting $30/month as extra payment), the rent per person might not be equal anymore. X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting more in terms of room size and getting $30 from Y. That seems unfair to X because he's not part of the deal and is effectively subsidizing the bigger room for Y through the writer's lower rent.\n\nWait, but how is the rent split? If the total rent is divided equally among all three, then each pays a third. If Y is paying an extra $30 to the writer, that's separate from the main rent. So the total rent each pays is their third plus $30 for Y. The writer gets $30 from Y, so effectively, the writer's share of the rent is reduced by $30. That would mean the writer is paying less total than the others. X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting more money from Y. So X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is not paying the same as X because they're getting extra from Y. That's probably why X is upset. He feels the writer is getting an unfair advantage by negotiating a side deal without involving him.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, in roommate situations, such agreements can be tricky. If the original rent was split equally, and the room allocation was part of the agreement (like whoever gets the bigger room pays more), then the writer's initial allocation through random.org might have been fair. But once Y wanted to switch, the writer allowed it for $30/month. However, if the overall rent split isn't adjusted to account for room size, then X is paying the same as the writer even though the writer has a smaller room. But in this case, the writer is getting the bigger room, so maybe the rent should be adjusted accordingly. Wait, no\u2014the writer originally had the big room but gave it up for $30. So now Y has the big room and pays $30 more. But the writer is getting $30 from Y. So the writer's total is their regular rent minus $30, while X is paying regular rent. That makes the writer's effective rent lower than X's. So X is paying more per month than the writer, which is unfair because they both have the same room size. X is subsidizing the writer's gain from the deal, which is why he's upset.\n\nSo, the problem is that the writer made a side agreement that affects the overall fairness of the rent split without including X. Roommate agreements should ideally be mutual among all parties. If the writer and Y decided to have a side payment, it's possible that X didn't agree to that and now feels it's unfair. The writer might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision, leading to an unequal distribution in terms of effective rent. Even though the initial allocation was fair, the subsequent side deal created an imbalance that X didn't agree to. Therefore, the answer might be that the writer is in the wrong because the side deal without informing or involving X is unfair to him.\n"
