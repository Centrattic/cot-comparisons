Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by charging a roommate an extra $30 a month to give up the big room. They had an initial agreement where they used a random generator to decide the bigger room. The other roommate, Y, wanted it and after winning the random draw, the author got the big room. But then Y came back after three days and asked to switch, leading to an agreement where Y could take the room if they paid $30 more each month. Now, X is upset because he feels it's unfair that the author and Y are getting different rent for the same room size.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: the apartment has three rooms, with one significantly bigger. When moving in, the author and Y both wanted the big room. Y thought the author would get it because of higher income if it was auctioned, so they decided to flip a coin or use a random generator. The author won that, so they had the right to the big room. Then, Y approached the author later and offered to pay $30 extra to take the big room. The author agreed. \n\nNow, X is upset because he didn't get a say in this arrangement. The author and Y decided between themselves. The question is whether this is fair or if the author is scamming the others. \n\nIn roommate agreements, typically, all parties should agree on any changes, especially in rent distribution. The author and Y made a private agreement without involving X. But initially, the room was allocated via a method agreed by both Y and the author, so the author's right to the big room wasn't based on income but on chance. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author negotiated a price. \n\nX is upset because he feels the rent is now unequal. But the rooms are different sizes. If the rent was split equally among all three, the author and Y ended up benefiting from the bigger room without paying more. However, since they arranged for Y to pay an extra $30 to the author, that might be a way to balance the value of the bigger room. But since all roommates are paying the same total rent to the landlord, the $30 is an internal transfer. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author should have involved X in the arrangement. If the original agreement was that the big room would be allocated via random.org, then the author and Y can't just change that without consulting X, the third roommate. X is part of the household and might have been expecting that any room changes would require consensus. \n\nSo, the problem is that the author and Y made a side deal without informing X. Even though the initial allocation was fair, altering it later without involving X could be seen as unfair. X might feel that his input was ignored in the decision-making process. \n\nAdditionally, the term \"scamming\" is strong here. The author isn't necessarily scamming, but the process might have been handled poorly. Roommate agreements usually require transparency and mutual agreement. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include X in the discussion about changing the room assignment and the rent adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely AITA for not including X in the arrangement, leading to perceived unfairness. The author's actions could be considered wrong because they altered the initial agreement without the third roommate's consent.\n"
