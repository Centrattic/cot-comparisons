Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves three people moving into an apartment with three rooms of different sizes. The big room is 40% larger than the others. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) and Y wanted the big room, while X didn't care. They decided to randomize it using a website, and Z got it. Then, after three days, Y asked for the big room and Z agreed to let Y have it in exchange for $30 a month of their rent. Now X is upset because Z and Y are in similarly sized rooms, but Z is paying less.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether Z's arrangement with Y is fair to X. The user thinks Z isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. \n\nFirst, I need to consider roommate agreements and fairness. When splitting rent among roommates, especially in a non-uniform apartment, the usual expectation is that the bigger room, which has more space and possibly better features, would cost more. However, in this case, Z won the big room through a random draw, which Y thought was unfair because Z could afford to pay more. Then Z offered Y to switch if Y paid $30 extra. \n\nNow, when Z and Y made that deal, X didn't participate. The problem is that X is feeling that Z is now getting a discount by paying less rent for a room that's supposedly the same size as his. But wait, the big room was originally supposed to be split between Z and Y through a different method. The fact that Y later offered to pay $30 more to take the big room from Z might mean that Z is effectively getting $30 back, which could be seen as a form of compensation. However, the original rent split was likely equal, assuming they all paid the same. \n\nIf the total rent is divided equally among three people, each paying the same amount, then one person getting money from another to switch rooms could throw off the fairness. The argument is that the big room's value wasn't factored into the rent split, so Z is now effectively paying less for the same space as X. But if the initial agreement was that the big room would be allocated by random.org, then Z's right to the room was determined by that method. However, when Y asked to switch later, Z might have allowed it without considering X's perspective, which is now causing resentment.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the initial random allocation set a precedent that the big room's value should be considered in the rent split? If the initial agreement was that the big room would be randomly assigned, then after the switch, Y is paying the same total rent as before but now has the bigger room, while Z is getting $30 from Y. But if the original rent was split equally, then Z's room is no longer the same size as X's. Therefore, by allowing Y to take the big room in exchange for $30, Z is effectively getting a private arrangement that affects the shared rent split. \n\nIn roommate situations, when rooms are of unequal size, it's common to adjust the rent based on the room's value. Here, the initial method was random, but after the switch, there's a new arrangement that might not be equitable to X. If the total rent isn't adjusted so that Y pays more for the bigger room while Z pays less, then X is paying the same as Z for a smaller room, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut if the initial agreement was only about who gets the room first, and after the switch, the rent should be adjusted accordingly, but Z is taking $30 from Y instead of reducing their own rent or increasing Y's. Wait, that's confusing. If all three are paying the same rent, but Z is getting $30 from Y, then Z is effectively getting a side payment. That might not be fair to X, because the rent structure isn't reflecting the actual room sizes. \n\nAlternatively, if the total rent is split equally, but the big room is considered worth more, then Y should be paying more overall. But since the initial assignment was random, maybe the rent wasn't adjusted. So when Z and Y switch, but the rent remains the same, and Z gets $30 from Y, that's not properly accounting for the room's value in the shared cost. Instead, Y should be paying more in total, and Z should be paying less, not getting a side payment. \n\nIn that case, Z's arrangement might be seen as unfair because they're profiting from the room swap without adjusting the overall rent split. This could lead to situations where other roommates feel their contributions or room sizes aren't being valued properly. So X is right to be upset because the current arrangement doesn't equitably distribute the cost based on the room's size. \n\nBut on the other hand, Z and Y agreed on a private arrangement. If the original rent was set without considering room sizes, then maybe the fault lies in the initial agreement. However, once a room is assigned, can you then charge someone else to switch? It's possible, but it's a private agreement that might not be transparent to X, leading to his frustration. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the initial rent split was fair considering the room sizes. If the rent was split equally regardless of room size, then Z and Y's deal might be a way to compensate, but it's not properly integrated into the overall rent, making it seem like Z is getting an unfair advantage. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement doesn't fairly address the room value in the shared rent, causing inequity. So the answer is A.\n"
