Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a situation involving roommates and the big room. \n\nFirst, the setup: The apartment has three rooms, one significantly larger. When moving in, the author and roommates Y and Z (wait, the roommates are X and Y, right?) had to decide who gets the big room. The author wanted it, Y did too. X didn't care. They initially discussed a bidding system, but Y said it wasn't fair because of income differences. So they used a random number generator, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y asked to switch, and the author agreed to let Y take the big room if Y paid $30 less of the author's rent each month. Now, roommate X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming them by getting a better deal without involving him.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about fairness in roommate agreements. The initial allocation was decided by a random draw, which seems fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author negotiated a price where Y pays $30 less. But X is now upset because he believes the author is getting an unfair advantage by not sharing this arrangement. \n\nWait, the apartment's total rent is split among the three, right? If the big room is considered to have higher value, typically in roommate situations, the person in the bigger room might pay more. But in this case, the author was in the big room initially and then switched with Y, but instead of Y paying extra, the author is paying less? Wait, no. Wait, the author said that if Y pays $30 of the author's rent every month, Y can have the room instead. So the author is paying less, and Y is taking over the room by effectively paying a lower share? That might be the confusion here. \n\nLet me re-read the part. \"You can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is giving up the big room, and Y is taking it by paying $30 of the author's rent. That means the author's rent is reduced by $30, and Y's is increased by $30. So the total rent remains the same. But X is mad because he's in a smaller room and not part of the deal. So X is paying the same as before, while the author is now in a smaller room but paying less, and Y is in the big room but paying more. \n\nWait, the problem is that the original allocation was a random draw, so each roommate had an equal chance. Then, after the author got the big room, they negotiated a private agreement where Y pays the author $30, so the author's rent is lower. But X, who didn't participate in the initial draw or the subsequent negotiation, is now upset because he feels the author is taking advantage. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they all agreed to split the rent equally, then the author's decision to transfer part of their rent to Y might disrupt that. But if the total rent is split based on room size, maybe the initial arrangement was that the big room is allocated via random draw, and perhaps there was an understanding that the person in the big room would pay more. But the author didn't do that; they gave up the big room for a lower rent. \n\nWait, the original scenario was that they had to decide who takes the big room. The author and Y both wanted it. Y said a bidding system would be unfair because of income. So they used a random generator. The author got it. Then Y asked to switch, so the author said Y can have it if Y pays $30 of the author's rent. So the author's rent is reduced by $30, and Y's is increased by $30. But X is in another small room, paying the same as before. \n\nNow, X is upset because he feels the author is getting preferential treatment. The issue might be that the initial decision to allocate the big room via random was among all roommates, but the author and Y made a private agreement that affects the rent split. If X was part of the original agreement where the big room was allocated randomly, then maybe the author should have included X in the subsequent negotiation. Because if the big room is supposed to be allocated based on some criteria (like bidding or random), but then later the author and Y privately adjust the rent, it might not be fair to X. \n\nBut in the original agreement, the author and Y decided among themselves to use a random generator, and X didn't care. Now, when the author allows Y to take the big room by reducing their own rent, X is being left out. If the total rent is split equally, then the author is effectively paying $30 less, which might be seen as taking from X's share. But if the rent was split based on room size, then maybe the initial allocation was different. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that they split the rent based on room size. The author just mentions that the big room is now rightfully theirs. \n\nWait, the original agreement was to use a random.org roll after Y objected to the bidding. So the author and Y both wanted the big room, and they used a random draw. X was okay with that. Then, Y wants to switch, so the author sets up a deal where Y pays $30 more (or the author pays $30 less) to get the big room. But if the rent was already split equally, then the author is reducing their own rent by $30, which might mean X is now paying more than the author. \n\nSo the problem is that X is now paying more of the total rent than Y and the author. If the initial agreement was that the big room is allocated randomly, and each roommate pays an equal share, then once the author gives up the room to Y by reducing their rent, they are essentially changing the rent split without consulting X. That could be seen as unfair, especially if X didn't agree to the new terms. \n\nBut the author might argue that since X didn't care about the big room and was allocated one of the smaller rooms, the author had the right to negotiate with Y to transfer the room. However, the issue is that the rent split is a group agreement, so any changes to individual shares would require all roommates to agree. By the author and Y making a private deal without involving X, it's possible that X is now paying a larger portion of the rent, which could be a point of contention. \n\nIn roommate situations, typically, if rooms are of different sizes, the rent is adjusted accordingly. If the total rent is fixed, then the one in the bigger room should pay more. The initial allocation via random might have been fair if the rent was split equally, but when the author decides to give up their claim to the big room by reducing their own rent, that's a change in the financial arrangement. X, who is also in a small room, might feel that the author is getting a better deal by lowering their rent without adjusting X's share. \n\nSo if the author and Y made a deal where Y pays more (or author pays less) to switch rooms, but didn't involve X in the new rent arrangement, that's where the problem arises. Because if the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author's reduction would mean that X's share is effectively higher. However, if the initial agreement was that the big room is allocated randomly and each pays the same, but the author and Y then adjust the rent between themselves, without considering X's input, it's possible that X is being treated unfairly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author and Y's deal involves Y paying the author $30 as a form of compensation, not as part of the overall rent. But in that case, the total rent is still split equally, and the $30 is a separate payment between the author and Y. But if X is paying the same as before, and the author is effectively getting $30 from Y (which would be on top of their rent), but the problem is phrased as \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is getting $30 less in their rent payment, and Y is paying $30 more, which would mean that the total rent is still split equally between all three, but the author is subsidizing Y's higher payment. Wait, no\u2014if the total rent is fixed, then the author's rent is reduced by $30, and Y's is increased by $30. But X's share is part of the total. So if the total is $X + Y's adjusted rent, then X's share is now part of a different split. \n\nBut if all roommates agreed to split the rent equally, regardless of room size, then the author's decision to take $30 less for the room might be problematic because it changes the distribution. The problem here is whether the initial agreement about room allocation included any terms about rent. The author and Y used a random draw to assign the big room, but X didn't participate in that decision. Wait, no, the author and Y were the two who wanted the big room, and X didn't care. So the initial decision was between the author and Y, and X was okay. But when the author and Y later negotiate a switch, X is upset because he wasn't involved. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the original agreements. If the initial allocation was a one-time decision and the rent split was agreed upon without considering room size, then the author can't unilaterally change their rent share without all parties agreeing. By reducing their own rent by $30, the author is effectively taking $30 from X's share, which X didn't agree to. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they altered the financial agreement without consulting X. \n\nAlternatively, if the original agreement allowed for adjustments based on room assignment, but the author and Y made a private deal without involving X, that could be a problem. The key is whether the roommate group had a prior agreement on how room sizes affect rent splits. If not, then the author and Y's private agreement might have been done without the group's knowledge, leading to X's dissatisfaction. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong if they changed their rent share without involving all roommates. Because the overall rent split is a group matter, and altering it unilaterally could be seen as unfair to others. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Let me check again.\n\nThe initial problem was about the big room allocation. The author and Y wanted it, X didn't. They decided by random, author got it. Then Y asked to switch. The author agreed to switch for $30/month. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same as the author, who is in a smaller room, but the author is getting $30 less in total. So if the total rent is split equally, and the author is in a smaller room but paying $30 less, that would mean X is paying more than the author. That's the crux of X's complaint. \n\nIf the original agreement was that the big room is assigned randomly but everyone pays equal rent, then once the author gives up the big room, they should all still pay the same. But the author is not doing that. Instead, they are adjusting their own rent, which could be a breach of the original agreement. The problem is that the author is effectively creating a new agreement without involving X. If the group had a rule that room assignments affect rent splits, then the author should have involved everyone. But if there was no such rule, and the original split was equal, then the author's decision to take less rent might be unfair to X. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they changed the financial arrangement without consensus from all roommates. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
