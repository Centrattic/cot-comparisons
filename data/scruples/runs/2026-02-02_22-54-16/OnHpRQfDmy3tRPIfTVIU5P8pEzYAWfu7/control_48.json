Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates dividing up rent and room sizes. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, there were three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. The author wanted the big room. Y also wanted it but didn't want a bidding war because of income differences. They flipped a coin (using random.org), and the author won the big room. Then Y later wanted to switch, and the author agreed to let him have the big room if he paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because the author is paying less rent for the same size room as X.\n\nHmm. Let's think about fairness. Initially, they randomized the room assignment. That seems fair. Then Y wanted to switch, and the author made a deal where Y pays extra. But X is paying the same as the author, who has the bigger room. Wait, X didn't get the big room initially. Wait, the author had the big room after the random selection. Then they switched with Y. So X was in one of the smaller rooms from the start. Now the author is in a smaller room, but X is still in a smaller one? Or did X switch with someone else?\n\nWait, the original setup was three people, three rooms. The author got the big room via randomization. Then author and Y swapped, with Y paying $30. So X's room size hasn't changed, right? X was in a small room all along. The author moved out of the big room into a small one. So X is in a small room, Y is in the big one paying extra, and the author is in a small room but paying less? Wait, no. The author was in the big room and gave it up for $30 less. So author is in a small room, paying $30 less, while Y is in the big room. X is in another small room, paying the original rate. So X's rent hasn't changed, but the author's rent is lower because they gave up the big room. \n\nX is upset because he's in a small room and the author is also in a small room but paying less. Wait, no\u2014X is in a small room, author is in a small room, but the author is paying $30 less. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is paying less. Wait, maybe the original rent split was even? So if they split the total rent equally, then X is paying his share, author is paying less because of the $30. But if the total rent is fixed, then maybe the author's payment is lower, meaning X has to cover the difference? Or is the $30 going to the author instead of being part of the rent?\n\nWait, the author said that if Y pays $30 of the author's rent, then Y can have the room. So does that mean the total rent is now adjusted? For example, if the total rent is $1000, each person was paying $333. If Y pays $30 to the author, then the author is now paying $303, and Y pays $303 plus $30 to the author. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the author is keeping the $30, so their own share is reduced by $30. But that could mean the total rent isn't being covered properly. If the landlord still charges the same total rent, then the author's individual payment is lower, but maybe X and Y are paying more to cover the author's reduction. That's probably not the case here. The author might have just kept the $30 as their own money. If that's the case, then the author is effectively getting $30 from Y, which could be seen as profiting from the room switch. But X is in the same room as the author, but the author is getting money for something X isn't. \n\nFrom X's perspective, he might feel that the room sizes are now uneven. Initially, they had a random assignment, but after the switch, Y has the big room, author has a small room, and X still has a small room. But X didn't get a discount like the author. So X is paying the same as before, but Y is effectively paying more (the $30) to have the better room. X might feel that since they all agreed to split the rent equally, the author shouldn't be getting extra money from someone else. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's agreement with Y affects X's rent and fairness. If the author is taking $30 from Y, which isn't part of the shared rent, then X is still paying their original share. However, if the total rent is fixed, and the author is reducing their own share by $30, then X and Y might have to adjust their payments to cover that. But the author didn't mention that. It seems like the author is keeping the $30, which could be considered unfair because it creates an unequal distribution of financial burden. \n\nAlso, when they initially randomized the rooms, the author had a fair chance. Then allowing Y to switch for money could be seen as favoritism, especially if X didn't agree to the terms. The author didn't consult X about the switch, which might be why X feels left out. If X wasn't part of the agreement, he might feel that the author has an unfair advantage. \n\nAnother angle: roommates often agree on splitting rent equally. If one person gets a better room, it's common to adjust the rent so everyone pays fairly. The author's arrangement with Y might not have been done correctly. Instead of Y paying the author $30, maybe they should have adjusted their rent so that Y pays more overall, and the author gets compensated through the shared rent. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the $30 arrangement doesn't account for the shared rent structure and could be seen as personal gain at the expense of X. Also, not involving X in the decision-making process could contribute to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
