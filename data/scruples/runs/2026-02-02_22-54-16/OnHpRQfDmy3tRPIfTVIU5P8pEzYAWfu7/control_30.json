Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates and splitting rent based on room sizes. The author moved in with two others, X and Y. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the other two. Before moving in, they discussed who would get the bigger room. Initially, Y wanted it, and the author also wanted it. They considered a random draw or a bidding system. Y objected to bidding because of income differences, so they went with a random.org roll, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y asked to switch, and the author agreed if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because the author is paying less rent than X for a bigger room, even though X didn't participate in the initial decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The initial agreement was between the author and Y. X didn't have a say in the process. When they moved in, X was fine with the random selection, but now that the author is getting a bigger room for less rent, X feels cheated.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. Did the author have the right to decide the room allocation without X's input? The author and Y resolved the room issue between themselves, but X wasn't part of that agreement. If all three roommates are splitting the rent, the allocation of the bigger room should ideally be a mutual agreement. The author made a deal with Y, but X wasn't part of that, so he feels excluded.\n\nAlso, the rent allocation might not be equal. If the bigger room is worth more, the rent should reflect that. If the author is in the bigger room and paying less, that's a problem for the others. The original plan was to use a random draw, but after the switch, the author is effectively getting a discount on their rent for a better room. That might not be fair to X, who didn't have a say.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not involving X in the initial decision and the subsequent agreement. Roommate agreements should ideally be mutual. Since X was part of the living arrangement, his input should have been considered from the start. By making a deal with Y without X's consent, the author might be seen as acting unilaterally, leading to the current conflict.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because the author didn't involve X in the decision-making process, leading to an unfair distribution from X's perspective. The author should have addressed the room allocation with all roommates to ensure everyone's agreement on how rent is split based on room sizes.\n"
