Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and the big room. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with two others, X and Y. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the others. Before moving in, they discussed who gets the big room. The author wanted it, and Y also wanted it. They initially tried to resolve it by using a random number generator, which the author won. So the author got the big room. But after three days, Y came back asking to have the room instead, and the author agreed that Y could have it if Y paid $30 extra each month to the author. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the initial allocation: the author and Y decided to use a random draw, which is a common way to split things when people can't agree. The author won, so by that agreement, they should have kept the big room. But Y later changed their mind, perhaps realizing they needed the space for a bed. The author then offered a trade: Y could take the big room if they paid $30/month more. That seems like a fair compromise if both parties agreed. The author isn't forcing anything; they reached a mutual agreement with Y.\n\nNow, X's problem is that he wasn't part of the negotiation. He's in a smaller room and feels the author isn't paying a fair share. But initially, X didn't care who got the room. The problem arises after the swap. X wasn't involved in the room swap, so he didn't agree to the terms. However, the author and Y made their own agreement. The author is paying 30$ less because Y is covering that extra cost. If the total rent is split equally, maybe the author's share is reduced by the $30, but the total remains the same. Wait, maybe the original arrangement was that all three split the rent equally, but then the author is getting $30 from Y each month, so effectively, the author's share is lower. But X isn't getting anything from Y. That might be why X is upset.\n\nBut legally, the room assignment and payment arrangements are up to the roommates to agree upon. If all three had agreed on a certain rent split, then changing it after the fact without X's consent could be an issue. However, in this case, the author and Y made an agreement to swap rooms with compensation. If the total rent is divided equally, the author's share would be reduced by $30, but the author is giving up the big room. However, X wasn't part of this, so he's now paying the same as before but the author is paying less. That's not fair from X's perspective because he's in a smaller room, but he's not getting any of the extra. The problem is that the author and Y changed the arrangement without involving X, which might be a mistake.\n\nBut the author's initial agreement was to use random.org, and then later adjusted when Y asked. The author isn't scamming; they're making a private agreement with Y. However, the issue is that the total rent might not be split properly. If the apartment's total rent is fixed, and all three roommates split it equally, then the author's decision to get $30 from Y would mean that Y is effectively paying more than the original split. But if the original agreement was that each pays equal, then the author is taking advantage by keeping the smaller room and getting money from Y, which could be seen as unfair to X.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original rent was split based on room sizes, but that wasn't mentioned. If the big room's cost was included in the total rent, then the author moving to a smaller room and getting $30 from Y would make their share lower. But if X is still in the same room, he's not affected except that the author is paying less. However, if the total rent is split equally, then the author's arrangement with Y is creating an imbalance in who pays what, which X didn't agree to. \n\nThe key point is whether the author and Y's agreement affects X. If X was part of an original agreement where all three split the rent equally, then the author's arrangement with Y could be unfair to X. But if the author and Y's deal is a private adjustment, like Y is covering the author's share as a form of rent difference, but in reality, the total amount paid by Y might be higher, which could be a problem. \n\nHowever, the author isn't scamming; they're just making a deal with Y to compensate for the room swap. The problem is that X wasn't part of the negotiation, which is why he's upset. The author might have made a mistake in not involving X in the agreement, but is that being in the wrong? It depends on whether the original arrangement allowed for room swaps and adjustments without others. If the original plan was that rooms are assigned via random draw, and swapping is allowed with mutual consent between two parties, then the author is not in the wrong. However, if the room assignments and rent splits require consensus among all roommates, then the author might be at fault.\n\nBut typically, room assignments and private agreements between two roommates can be made without needing the third's consent, unless there's a prior agreement stating otherwise. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, X is upset because he feels the arrangement is unfair. The author could have considered X's perspective by including him in the discussion, but legally or morally, it's not clear that the author is wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted based on agreements with Y and followed through on a compromise. While X is upset, the author isn't scamming them. The main issue is that the author didn't involve X in the process, but the agreement between two roommates is valid unless there's a rule against it. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
