Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and a dispute over the bigger bedroom and the extra money paid for it.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with two roommates. Before moving in, there was a discussion about who would get the bigger room. The author and Y both wanted it. Y didn't want a bidding war because of income differences, so they decided to flip a coin (used a random number generator) and the author won. Then, three days later, Y changed his mind and offered to pay $30/month to swap. The author agreed, so Y took the big room, and the author got $30 off their rent. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but in a smaller room.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The initial allocation was random, which seems fair. Then Y wanted to trade, and the author agreed to a trade where Y pays extra. The problem is X didn't have a say in this, and he feels it's unfair because he's not getting the same deal. \n\nBut was the author wrong? The original agreement was between the author and Y. If the room assignments and financial arrangements weren't part of a formal agreement with X, then perhaps it's up to the roommates involved. However, since all three are sharing the apartment, any changes that affect the overall rent splits or room assignments should ideally involve input from everyone. If the author and Y made a private deal without considering X's input, that could be seen as unfair, especially if X is paying the same rent as the author but in a smaller space. \n\nAnother angle: when they moved in, the initial agreement was that the big room was assigned randomly. The author then gave it up in exchange for money. If the original rent was split equally among three people, then the author's reduction of $30 would effectively mean Y is paying more in total. But if the total rent is split evenly, the author's $30 discount would mean the others are effectively subsidizing Y's payment. That could create an imbalance.\n\nSo, maybe the author should have involved X in the discussion when the swap happened. Since the author and Y changed the initial agreement without consulting X, it's possible that X feels left out and that the arrangement isn't fair. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not getting consent from all three roommates for the new arrangement. However, if X wasn't part of the initial decision to assign rooms randomly, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the key point is that changing the agreement later without X's input could be the issue. \n\nHmm. In roommate situations, decisions that affect shared resources or costs should involve all parties. The author and Y made a deal that impacted X's living situation and cost distribution. So, the author might be in the wrong for not getting X's consent before agreeing to the $30 deal. Therefore, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
