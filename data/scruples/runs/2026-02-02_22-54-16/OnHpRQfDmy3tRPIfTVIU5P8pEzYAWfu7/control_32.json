Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate Y by having a bigger room and paying less rent. The situation is that they moved into an apartment with two others. The big room is 40% larger than the others. Before moving in, there was a discussion about who gets the big room. Y wanted it but was concerned about fairness because the user has a higher income. They decided to flip a coin (using a random generator), and the user won. So initially, the big room was assigned through a random method.\n\nThen, after three days, Y asked to swap the room, offering to pay $30 extra each month to the user. The user agreed to that arrangement because they wanted the big room but also wanted Y to cover part of their rent. Now, X is upset, claiming the user is scamming him because he ends up paying more for the same room size. The user is confused and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of the initial assignment. Since the coin toss was agreed upon by both Y and the user, that seems fair. The user got the big room through a legitimate method. Then, when Y wanted to swap, the user set a price of $30/month extra for Y to take the big room. Y agreed to that, so the arrangement was mutual. However, the problem arises with X's reaction. X isn't part of the agreement between the user and Y, but now he's paying more rent because Y is effectively paying less for the big room.\n\nThe key here is whether the rental agreement was split equally among all three roommates. If the user and Y had an arrangement where Y pays $30 extra to the user, that would mean the user is receiving money from Y, but the total rent split among the three might not be adjusted accordingly. For example, if the total rent is divided equally, but Y is paying an extra $30 to the user, then the user's share of the rent would actually be lower than the others. X is upset because he's paying the same as the user, but the user is in a bigger room. However, X wasn't part of the initial agreement between the user and Y. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is part of a group where they all pay a total amount each month. Let's say the total rent is $1000, and each roommate pays $333.33. If Y is willing to pay $30 extra to take the big room, then perhaps the user and Y adjusted their individual payments. If the user is now paying $303.33 and Y is paying $363.33, that would make the user's share lower, but Y's share higher. However, if the total rent isn't adjusted, and the user is still paying the same as X, but Y is paying $30 to the user, then the user's total payment (including the $30 from Y) would be $333.33 + $30 = $363.33, which is the same as Y's. But X is paying $333.33. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the total rent is split equally, then each roommate should pay the same amount. If Y is giving $30 to the user, that might mean the user is effectively paying $30 less, which would make the user's total payment lower than X's. But how?\n\nLet me clarify. Suppose the total monthly rent is $1000. If the user and Y each pay their share of the total rent, but Y is giving the user $30, then the user's net payment is $333.33 - $30 = $303.33, while X is still paying $333.33. That would mean X is paying more in total than the user. But why would X be upset? Because X is in the same size room as the user but paying more. However, the user's room is bigger. So if the user is in a bigger room but paying less in total, that's the issue X is bringing up. \n\nNow, the user's argument is that the big room was assigned via a random method, and they had an agreement where Y pays $30 for it. But if the total rent isn't adjusted to account for the size difference, then the user is effectively getting a discount for a bigger room. X might feel that this is unfair because he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the user. But the user's initial assignment was based on a coin toss, which they agreed to. Then, when Y wants to change the arrangement, the user is allowed to charge for the switch if they agreed on it. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the user is now paying less than X, which is causing the conflict. The user's $30 from Y might not be enough to compensate for the size difference. The user's share of the total rent is still the same as X's, but since Y is paying user $30, the user is effectively getting $30 more than X. So if the total is split equally, the user is in a bigger room and also getting $30 more. That seems unfair to X. \n\nBut the user and Y made a private agreement. If the total rent is split equally, perhaps the user should have taken that $30 from Y and given it to X to balance things out. However, the user didn't do that. So X is upset because the user is in a bigger room and not paying their fair share, while X is in a smaller room and paying the same. \n\nThe user's mistake here is that by allowing Y to pay $30 extra to take the big room, the user is not adjusting their own share of the rent. The initial assignment via a coin toss was fair, but once Y wants to switch, the rent should be adjusted so that the person in the bigger room pays more. If the user is in the big room and Y is paying them $30, the user is in a better position, which is causing the conflict with X. \n\nSo the user is in the wrong because they didn't adjust the rent split to account for the room size. Instead, they kept the same total share and took money from Y, which effectively made X pay more relative to the user. The correct approach would have been to either adjust the total rent splits so that the user pays more for the big room, or have Y pay the user for the room difference. However, if the user is not paying more but receiving money, that creates an imbalance. \n\nTherefore, the user is at fault for not ensuring that the rent is split fairly based on room sizes after the agreement. Since the total rent isn't adjusted, X is paying the same as the user, but the user's room is bigger and they're getting $30 from Y, which isn't being shared with X. The user should have either increased their own share of the rent or distributed the $30 from Y among all roommates or to X to balance the cost. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
