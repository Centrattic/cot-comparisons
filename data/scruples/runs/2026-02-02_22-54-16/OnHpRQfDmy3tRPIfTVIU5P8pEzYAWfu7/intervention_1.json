Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) asked the other two roommates, X and Y, who wants the big room. Y wanted it, but there was a conflict because Z also wanted it. They considered a random method or a bidding system based on income. Y argued that since Z has a higher income, a bidding might not be fair, so they went with a random.org draw, and Z won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and offered to pay $30/month for the big room. Z agreed, letting Y take the room in exchange for the $30. Now X is upset because Z is paying less rent than X, even though they have the same room size.\n\nThe key points here are fairness and prior agreement. Initially, the big room was assigned randomly, which both Y and Z agreed to. When Y wanted to switch, Z and Y made a private agreement where Y pays $30/month to Z. However, X wasn't part of this agreement. X is now upset because the rent distribution isn't equal among all roommates, even though the room sizes are the same for Z and X. \n\nBut wait, the total rent is split among the three. If Z is paying less because Y is contributing $30 to Z, does that mean X ends up paying more? Let's see: If the total rent is divided equally, but Y gives $30 to Z, then effectively, Z's share is reduced by $30. X might feel that the rent distribution isn't fair because they're paying the same as Z, but Z's room is bigger. However, Z's room was assigned fairly via a random draw. When Y wanted to switch, they came to an agreement with Z without involving X. \n\nX's complaint is about the rent being unequal. But the initial agreement between Z and Y was based on their own terms. If the total rent is split equally, but Y is giving $30 to Z, then X's payment remains the same. However, if the rent is split based on room size, then Z's room was bigger, but after switching, Y's room is bigger. The problem arises because the rent isn't adjusted for room sizes. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that Z isn't in the wrong. The reasoning is that the initial allocation was fair, and the switch was agreed upon between Z and Y. However, X might feel that the rent should be adjusted based on room size. But in many roommate situations, rent is split equally regardless of room size unless otherwise agreed. The issue here is that the agreement between Z and Y created an unequal split in effective rent (Z getting $30 from Y), which affects X's share. \n\nIs Z in the wrong? It depends on whether the total rent paid by each roommate reflects their room size. If the apartment charges equal rent per person regardless of room size, then Z's arrangement with Y might be a private agreement. However, if the total rent is split equally, but Y is effectively paying more to Z, then X could argue that the arrangement isn't fair. But since X wasn't part of the agreement, maybe it's not Z's fault. Alternatively, Z should have involved X in the initial agreement about room assignments and rent distribution to avoid this conflict. \n\nAnother angle: When they moved in, the big room was assigned via a random draw, which X agreed to. Then, when Y wanted to switch, Z and Y made a private deal. X wasn't consulted again, so he might feel left out. But the initial agreement was between Z and Y. If the total rent is split equally, but Y is paying Z, then Z's effective rent is lower. However, if the total rent is supposed to be split equally among all three, including the room size, then maybe X's room is smaller, so he's paying the same as Z, who now has a smaller room. Wait, no\u2014Z gave up the big room to Y. So Y now has the big room, Z and X have the same size. If the total rent is split equally, then everyone pays the same. But Y is giving $30 to Z, so effectively, Z is getting $30 from Y. That would mean Z's share is less than X's. But X is paying the same as Z, but Z's room is the same size as X's. Wait, no\u2014Z gave up the big room. So Y has the big room, Z and X have the small ones. If the rent is split equally, then Y has the biggest room and is paying the same as others, but Y gives $30 to Z. So Y is effectively paying more in total. \n\nThis is getting complicated. The key issue is whether the agreement between Z and Y is fair and if it affects X. Since X wasn't part of the agreement, he might feel it's unfair that Z is receiving money from Y, leading to an unequal distribution. However, in roommate situations, private agreements between roommates for room swaps with compensation are common. The problem is that X wasn't informed or involved, leading to his resentment. \n\nThe original question is whether Z is in the wrong. If the agreement was fair and voluntary between Z and Y, and X wasn't part of the initial agreement, then Z isn't in the wrong. However, if the total rent distribution isn't accounting for room sizes, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But since the agreement was between two roommates, Z might not be at fault. However, if the overall rent distribution among all three isn't fair, then maybe Z should have considered X's perspective. \n\nIn many cases, roommates agree on room assignments and rent splits upfront. If Z and Y made a private agreement without involving X, perhaps Z should have included X in the discussion to avoid conflict. But the initial assignment was random, and the switch was after the fact. So Z's decision to let Y move in for $30 isn't inherently wrong, but the lack of communication with X might be the root of the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer could lean towards B (No), because the agreement between Z and Y was made after the initial random assignment and was voluntary. However, the conflict arises because X wasn't included in the agreement, which might be a communication issue rather than Z being in the wrong.\n"
