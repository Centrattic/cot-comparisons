Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the three roommates moved in together. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the original poster (OP) asked who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. There was a conflict between OP and Y over who should get the big room. They considered random selection or paying extra. Y didn't want a bidding war because OP has a higher income. They flipped a coin using random.org, and OP won. After three days, Y changed his mind and offered to pay OP $30/month to switch. OP agreed, so Y took the big room, and OP gets $30 less rent. Now X is upset because he thinks OP is scamming him by getting a cheaper rent for the same room size.\n\nSo, the question is whether OP was in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nFirst, the initial agreement: OP and Y resolved the room assignment via a random draw, which seems fair. OP had the big room. Then, Y wanted to switch, so they made a private agreement where Y pays OP $30/month. That seems like a mutual agreement. However, X wasn't part of this arrangement. X is now upset because he feels the arrangement is unfair. \n\nThe problem here is whether OP should have included X in the decision-making. The original discussion about the big room was between OP and Y. X didn't express any interest in the big room initially, and OP and Y resolved their conflict without X's input. But after the agreement, X is upset because he's paying the same as OP but OP is paying less total rent. \n\nSo, is OP in the wrong? Well, they made a private agreement, but if the apartment's rent is split equally among three, and OP is effectively paying less because someone else is covering part of their rent, that might create an imbalance. However, if the agreement is that the room assignments affect individual rents, maybe the initial rent split wasn't adjusted based on room sizes. \n\nWait, the user mentions that the apartment's rent is split equally. If OP is in a smaller room, but Y is in the bigger one, but OP is getting $30 from Y, does that mean the total rent each pays is adjusted? Let me clarify. Suppose the total rent is $X. If each was supposed to pay equally, but OP is in a smaller room and gets $30 from Y, then OP's share is lower. But maybe the rent was split equally regardless of room size. So OP's personal rent is less because Y is paying them $30. However, if the original agreement was that the big room comes with a higher rent, but they didn't set it up that way, then maybe OP's arrangement is causing an unfair distribution. \n\nBut in the initial setup, they didn't specify room-based rent. The original arrangement was a draw. Then, after the draw, Y wanted to switch and OP agreed to a payment. So if the room assignments affect who's paying how much, then perhaps OP and Y's agreement creates a situation where X is paying the same as OP but OP is getting a discount. However, if the overall apartment's rent is divided equally, and OP is just receiving money from Y, then OP is effectively getting more than their share, and Y is paying more than their share. But X is still paying his fair share. \n\nBut maybe X is upset because he feels the room assignments should have been decided collectively, not just between OP and Y. The problem is that the initial decision was made by OP and Y without X's input. However, X didn't express any interest in the big room initially. So perhaps OP and Y had the right to resolve their own conflict. However, once the agreement is made, if the rent structure isn't adjusted accordingly, it might create an imbalance. \n\nAnother angle: if the apartment's rent is split equally, but the room sizes are different, maybe the roommates should have agreed on a system where the bigger room has a higher rent. But since they didn't, OP and Y's agreement might be a way to compensate for that. However, X didn't agree to this and now feels disadvantaged. \n\nSo, the key issue is whether the private agreement between OP and Y affects X's rights. Since the rent is split equally, but OP's effective rent is lower due to Y's payment, X is effectively subsidizing Y's larger room through OP's arrangement. That might be unfair to X. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, OP and Y made an agreement without X's consent. If the room assignments affect the rent distribution, then perhaps OP should have brought X into the discussion. However, X didn't care initially, so maybe OP wasn't wrong. But once the arrangement is made, X is now affected. \n\nIn summary, the problem is that OP and Y decided on a room arrangement and a financial adjustment without considering X's input, which might have led to an unfair situation for X. Therefore, OP might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision, even if the initial agreement was between OP and Y.\n"

Since X did not express interest in the room initially or participate in the negotiation, the author was not obligated to involve them. The arrangement was consensual between parties directly involved in the room dispute. X\u2019s frustration stems from the unequal rent distribution, but the author acted within their rights to negotiate a private agreement. X should have been included in room-assignment discussions from the start for future fairness.",
