Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with two roommates, X and Y. There are three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author also wanted it, so they discussed options. Y thought a bid would be unfair because the author might have higher income, so they decided to flip a coin (or use a random generator) to decide. The author won and got the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back saying they need the big room for their bed and offers to pay $30 more rent per month to get it. The author agrees, so Y pays $30 extra to move into the bigger room, and the author effectively pays less.\n\nNow, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal, paying $30 less, and is calling the author a scammer. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's think about fairness. The initial allocation was random between Y and the author, which seems fair. But when Y wanted to switch, the author agreed on a payment of $30. Now, X wasn't part of the original negotiation. X's room size didn't change. The issue is that X is upset because he's now paying the same as the author but the author is paying less. \n\nWait, but the total rent for the apartment is split how? If the three roommates split the total rent equally, then each pays the same amount, regardless of room size. But here, the author is effectively paying less because Y is paying $30 extra. However, in reality, the total rent for the apartment is fixed. If the author is transferring $30 to Y, then the actual total rent each person pays depends on how the original rent is structured. \n\nWait, the original problem says that the author is paying $30 less. So if the total rent is split equally, say each pays a base amount, and then there's an extra $30 from Y to the author. So the author's effective total payment is base - $30, and Y's is base + $30. X is paying base. So X is in the same position as the author was before, but the author is now getting $30 from Y. \n\nBut X wasn't part of the original agreement. The author and Y made a private agreement. So the question is whether that's fair. X's argument is that since he's in a smaller room, he's paying the same as the author who now has a bigger room but pays less. \n\nIs this a case of unequal room sizes not being accounted for in the rent splitting? Typically, in roommate situations, if rooms are different sizes, the rent might be split unevenly. However, in this case, the initial allocation was random, and then later there was a trade. But the problem is that the author is now effectively paying less because of the $30 transfer. \n\nBut the author isn't necessarily paying less in total to the landlord. The author is receiving $30 from Y, so if the original rent was split equally, the author might be getting $30 from Y, meaning the author's net payment is the same as before. Wait, no\u2014if the author was supposed to pay their share, and Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, then the author's total is their original share minus $30? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the original rent was split equally, and the author was paying their share. Then, if Y gives $30 to the author, the author is getting $30 more than their share, which might not be the case. \n\nThis part is a bit confusing. Let's clarify. Let's say the total monthly rent is, for example, $900, so each person was paying $300. The author was in the big room, paying $300. Then Y offers to pay $30 extra to move into the big room. So Y pays $330, and the author now gets $330 (their original $300 plus the $30 from Y). But that would mean the author is now paying nothing? No, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the author and Y are making a private agreement where Y pays the author $30 for the room, but the base rent to the landlord is still split equally. So each still pays $300 to the landlord, but Y gives the author $30 privately. So the author's net payment is $300 (to landlord) minus $30 (from Y) = $270. Y pays $300 to the landlord plus $30 to the author = $330. X pays $300 to the landlord. \n\nIn this case, X is paying $300, the author is effectively paying $270, and Y is paying $330. From the landlord's perspective, the total is $900. But in terms of the roommates' individual payments, the author is getting $30 from Y, which X isn't part of. \n\nX's problem is that he is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is now effectively paying less. But the author's room is bigger. If the initial setup was that all rooms are the same size, then splitting the rent equally would be fair. But since rooms are different sizes, it's common for rents to be split unevenly. However, in this case, the original allocation was random, and then a trade happened. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author and Y's private agreement is fair to X. Since X wasn't part of the original agreement and didn't agree to this arrangement, he might feel it's unfair. But if the initial agreement between the author and Y was voluntary and fair, then maybe it's not the author's fault. However, if the total rent to the landlord is split equally, and the author is receiving money from Y, that creates an imbalance where X is paying the same as the author, who is in a bigger room but effectively paying less. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is not necessarily paying less to the landlord; they're just receiving money from Y. So from the landlord's side, the total is the same. The issue is between the roommates. If the room sizes are different, but rent is split equally without considering room size, that's a separate issue. In this case, the author and Y made a deal to adjust the rent between themselves. \n\nBut X wasn't part of that. So perhaps X's complaint is about the unequal distribution of room sizes without corresponding rent adjustments. However, the author and Y's agreement might be seen as a private matter. However, if X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is in a bigger room but getting $30 from Y, then X might feel that the author is exploiting the situation. \n\nAlternatively, since the initial allocation was random, and then Y agreed to pay for the room, it's a voluntary exchange. The author isn't scamming anyone; they're making a deal with Y. However, if X is expected to share the cost of the room or if the initial rent division was supposed to be equal regardless of room size, then X might feel left out. \n\nIn many roommate situations, if rooms are different, the rent is split based on room size. If that wasn't done initially, and now a private deal is made, it might create an imbalance. The author's action might be considered fair between themselves and Y, but X's grievance is that he's not part of that arrangement, leading to unequal treatment. \n\nIs the author at fault for not involving X in the discussion? The author didn't do anything wrong in negotiating with Y, but maybe they should have considered that X's situation would be affected. However, since X was not part of the initial negotiation for the big room, it's unclear if X had any claim to it. \n\nSo, the answer could depend on whether the original agreement between the three roommates about rent splitting considered room sizes. If they agreed to split equally regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y creates an unfair advantage. If they were supposed to split based on room size, then the initial random allocation was incorrect. \n\nGiven the information, the author and Y made a deal after the initial random allocation. The author is not necessarily scamming anyone, as the deal was between two parties, and the author isn't taking advantage of X directly. However, X is upset because the arrangement leads to unequal payment among roommates. But the author isn't scamming X; they just made a deal with Y. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong (B), because the negotiation between the author and Y was voluntary and the author didn't deceive X. However, the situation might be seen as unfair by X, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
