Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves roommates moving into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: the author, X, and Y all moved in. The big room is 40% bigger. The author wanted the big room, as did Y. They decided to have a random draw via random.org, which the author won. Then Y wanted to switch, so the author offered to let Y have the room if Y paid $30 extra monthly. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying $30 less, even though X's room is the same size as Y's original one. X thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the initial agreement between author and Y was a mutual decision after a random draw. The author didn't consult X about the $30 payment. X feels it's unfair that he's paying more relative to the author, even though his room size is the same as the author's. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when roommates split rent unequally based on room size, it's common to adjust payments accordingly. However, in this case, the author and Y made a private agreement without X's knowledge. The author might have assumed that since X didn't care about the big room initially, it was okay to make the deal. But X is now upset because he feels the arrangement isn't fair. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not including X in the decision-making process. If the total rent is split in a way that the author gets a larger room and pays less, but X is in a smaller room and pays more, then X's room is smaller than the author's but the same as Y's. However, the author's room is bigger, so perhaps the author should have adjusted the rent in a way that accounts for the larger room. But since the author and Y made a deal where Y pays $30 to the author, maybe that's supposed to compensate for the room size. But if the total rent isn't adjusted, then the author is effectively getting a larger room for less money compared to X. \n\nWait, the rent structure isn't entirely clear. Are they paying equal shares of the total rent, but the author is getting a larger room? Or is the total rent split based on room size? If it's the former, the author might be getting an unfair advantage. If they split the rent equally, but the author has a bigger room, that could be seen as unfair. But in this case, the author and Y made a deal where Y pays $30 to the author, so maybe that's supposed to even things out. However, X is not part of that deal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total rent is split into three parts, with the big room costing more. If the author is in the big room but paying the same as X, that's unfair. But in the scenario, the author is paying $30 less because Y is paying the author. So the author's actual net payment is lower. But X is paying the same as before. The problem is that X's room is the same size as the original Y's room, but the author's room is bigger. So the author is in a larger room and paying less, while X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. That's a fairness issue. \n\nThe author's agreement with Y allowed Y to take the big room by paying $30 extra. So if Y is paying $30 to the author, does that mean that Y's total contribution is higher, thereby balancing the room size? If the total rent is split equally, then Y is effectively paying $30 more to the author, which might not be part of the overall rent split. So perhaps the author is receiving $30 from Y, but the overall rent is still split equally, making the author's net payment lower. \n\nIn this case, the author is benefiting from the arrangement without any consideration for X. X didn't agree to this and now feels wronged. The author's mistake was not considering that X might have a claim to the big room or that the arrangement would affect the fairness of rent distribution among all three roommates. \n\nAnother angle: when the author gave up the big room to Y for $30, perhaps the author should have adjusted the rent so that all three roommates are paying according to their room sizes. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the rent should be split accordingly. However, since the author and Y made a private deal, it's possible that the author is exploiting their position without considering the impact on X. \n\nIn roommate agreements, it's generally good practice to have all parties agree on the terms. The author didn't consult X, which might be the main issue here. Even if the author and Y had a mutual agreement, if it affects X's experience and fairness, the author should have included X. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they made a private arrangement that affects all three roommates without getting X's input. The fairness is compromised because X is now in a smaller room and paying more relative to the author. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
