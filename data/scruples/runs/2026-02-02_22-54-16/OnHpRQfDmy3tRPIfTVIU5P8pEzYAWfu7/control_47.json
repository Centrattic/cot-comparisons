Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates splitting rent in an apartment with three rooms of different sizes. The author wanted the bigger room and ended up getting it through a random draw after a dispute with roommate Y. Then, Y, who needed the bigger room for space, offered to pay $30 extra each month for the room, and the author agreed. Now, roommate X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but with a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were fair. The key points here are about the agreement between roommates. When the author and Y decided on the $30 exchange, was X part of that agreement? From the story, it seems like the agreement was only between the author and Y. X wasn't involved in that negotiation. So, if the rent is split equally among all three, but the author is effectively getting a better deal by keeping the bigger room without paying more, X feels like the author is exploiting him. \n\nBut wait, did the initial agreement about room assignments and rent consider the different room sizes? If the apartment is being split equally in terms of rent regardless of room size, then the author's decision to take the bigger room without paying more might be seen as unfair to X. However, the author and Y made an agreement where Y pays an extra $30 to switch rooms. That should, in theory, balance things out because the author is receiving $30 more from Y, which could be used to adjust the overall rent split. But if the total rent is divided equally among three people, then the author is still getting the bigger room and a $30 discount from Y's payment, which might not be properly accounted for.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have included X in the agreement. Since X wasn't part of the negotiation, he might feel left out and that the arrangement is unfair to him. If the three roommates had discussed how to handle different room sizes from the beginning, maybe a different arrangement would have been made. But since they didn't, the author's action was based on a bilateral agreement with Y.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" is strong. The author isn't stealing; they made a voluntary agreement with Y. However, if X is paying the same as the author but with a smaller room, the author might be in a better position, which could be seen as unfair. The issue here is whether the agreement with Y was sufficient to address the differences in room size and whether it's fair that X is not part of it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement with Y doesn't address the unequal value of the rooms in terms of rent split. Since X is paying the same as the author but has a smaller room, the author's agreement with Y doesn't fully compensate for the inequity in the overall setup. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
