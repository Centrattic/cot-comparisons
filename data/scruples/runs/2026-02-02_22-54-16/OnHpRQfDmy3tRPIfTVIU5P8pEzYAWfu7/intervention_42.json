Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving in together. Two smaller rooms and one bigger. The author (let's call them Z) wanted the big room. Y also wanted it. X didn't care. They decided to pick randomly, Z won. Then Y came back after three days and wanted to swap, offering to pay $30 extra each month to Z so Y could have the big room. Z agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and Z is paying less than him, even though X didn't care about the room size.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether Z did something wrong by accepting the $30 from Y. Let's think about fairness. When they moved in, the initial agreement was a random draw. Z won. Then Y wanted to change that by offering money. Since Z agreed to the swap, it seems like a voluntary exchange between two parties (Z and Y). X wasn't part of that negotiation because he didn't care about the room size. \n\nX's complaint is that he's paying more rent than Z now. But X initially didn't care about the room size. Maybe the total rent split was supposed to be equal, but the arrangement between Z and Y is a private agreement. Unless the original agreement stated that room assignments would affect rent splits, Z and Y made their own deal. \n\nHowever, maybe the problem is that X feels left out. If the apartment's total rent is split equally among all three, and Z is getting $30 from Y, then Z is effectively paying less of the total rent. That could cause imbalance. But if the deal between Z and Y is that Y is paying Z $30 towards the rent, then Y is paying more overall. So maybe the total rent each person pays is: Y pays $30 more than Z, and X pays the same as Z. But X is upset because he's in a smaller room but paying the same as Z.\n\nBut X didn't care about the room size initially. He might have agreed to equal rent splits from the start. Z and Y's arrangement could be seen as altering the original agreement without considering X's input. However, X didn't have a problem with the initial random assignment. The problem arises later when Y wants to swap. \n\nIs it fair for Z to accept money to swap rooms? If the room size affects the rent, maybe they should have all agreed on a system upfront. But since they didn't, and since X didn't care about the room, it's possible that Z and Y's arrangement is their own business. However, X might feel that the rent should be adjusted based on room size, but since X didn't want the big room, maybe he's not in a position to complain.\n\nAnother angle: if the total rent is split equally, then Z is effectively getting a discount for staying in the bigger room, and Y is paying extra. But if the original agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, then this might be altering that. However, the initial setup didn't specify that. The author might be in the right because they and Y negotiated a private arrangement. X's anger is because he's now paying more than Z, but he didn't have any issue with the room size. Maybe the problem is that the author didn't involve X in the decision, but since X didn't care, perhaps it's not necessary. \n\nI think the key here is whether the room assignments and any subsequent agreements impact the rent splits. If the original agreement was equal rent, then Z and Y's deal could create an imbalance. However, since X didn't care about the room size, he might just have to live with the fact that he's in a smaller room but pays the same as Z. Alternatively, if the rent should be adjusted based on room size, then X is paying more than his fair share. But since X didn't want the big room, maybe he's willing to accept the smaller room for lower rent. Wait, but in this case, Z is paying less, and X is paying the same. So maybe X is in the same position as before, but now feels Z is getting an unfair advantage. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything wrong by negotiating with Y. It's a private agreement between two roommates. Unless there was a prior agreement that all room changes require everyone's consent, the author isn't in the wrong. X's problem is more about the perceived fairness of the rent split, but the author isn't directly responsible for that unless they involved X in the deal. Since X wasn't part of it, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n"
