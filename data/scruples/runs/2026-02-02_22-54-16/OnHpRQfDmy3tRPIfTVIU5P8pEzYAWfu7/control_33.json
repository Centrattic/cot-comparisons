Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for a situation involving roommates and the assignment of a larger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three people moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. One is significantly bigger (40% larger). The author (let's call them Z) wanted the big room. Roommate Y also wanted it and proposed a bidding system but backed out because they thought Z's higher income would make it unfair. So instead, they did a random draw using a website, and Z won the big room. \n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back asking to switch, offering to pay Z $30 each month in exchange for the big room. Z agreed, and now roommate X is upset. X is claiming Z is scamming him because Z and X have the same-sized rooms but Z pays $30 less. \n\nNow, the question is whether Z is in the wrong. The key points to consider here are fairness and the initial agreement. \n\nInitially, they had a random draw because Y thought a bidding system would be unfair due to differing incomes. Z went along with this, so the initial agreement was based on chance. However, after the random draw, Y approached Z to negotiate a switch, and Z accepted the $30 offer. \n\nX's argument is that Z is now paying less rent than X for a room of the same size. But wait, the big room is 40% bigger. If Y is taking the big room by paying an extra $30, would that mean Z is actually paying less for a smaller room? Let me think about how the rent is typically split. If the total rent is split equally among all three, each would pay the same. But in this case, Z was the one who got the bigger room. \n\nIf the initial agreement was that the big room would be assigned by chance, and then Z and Y decided to switch with a $30 payment from Y to Z, then the total rent paid by each person might not be equal anymore. For example, if the total monthly rent is, say, $X, each person was paying $X/3. But if Y is now paying $X/3 + $30 to Z, and Z is effectively getting $30 from Y, that could mean Z is paying $X/3 - $30 to the landlord, while Y is paying $X/3 + $30. Meanwhile, X is still paying $X/3. \n\nThis would make Z's share of the rent less than X's, even though their rooms are smaller. That seems to be the issue. X is upset because the rent isn't being split equally per square meter. The problem is that the initial random draw might not have considered the size difference in the rent split. If the agreement was that whoever got the bigger room would pay more, but then Z accepted to give it up for $30, that could be seen as an unfair advantage if X and Y are paying the same as before. \n\nBut wait, the original agreement was that the big room was assigned randomly. The author then allowed Y to take it by paying $30. However, the total rent per person might still be the same as before. If the landlord charges each roommate the same amount regardless of room size, but Z is getting $30 from Y, then Z is effectively paying less of the actual rent. So in that scenario, Z is profiting because they are paying less than their roommates for a smaller room. \n\nIs that fair? If the room sizes are different but the rent is split equally, then the person in the bigger room isn't paying more. But when Z and Y made a side agreement, Z is now paying less, while Y is paying more. However, X hasn't changed their rent. So X's rent is the same as before, but now Y's is higher, and Z's is lower. \n\nX is arguing that it's unfair because Z is now in a smaller room but paying less. But if the original split was equal, and Z is getting a personal payment from Y, then Z's total out-of-pocket is less. The problem is that X is still paying the original share. \n\nBut the question is: Is Z scamming the roommates? The term \"scam\" implies some form of deception or unfair advantage. Z didn't know when they entered the random draw that they would later accept a payment from Y to switch. So when the initial agreement was made, it was fair to all. However, when Y approached to switch with a side payment, that's a personal agreement between Z and Y. \n\nBut if all three roommates are paying the same to the landlord, and Y is paying Z an extra $30, then Z is gaining $30 a month from Y. If the room sizes are supposed to affect the rent split, but the landlord didn't do that, maybe Z is in a position where they can get more money for a room that isn't actually costing them more. \n\nX's issue is that the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. So perhaps the problem is that Z is making a profit from a room that's smaller but not contributing the same amount to the total rent as the others. \n\nBut the original agreement to assign the big room was done with all three present, right? The user mentioned that they asked the roommates who wanted the big room. The problem arises later when Y wants to switch and Z and Y make a side deal. \n\nSo, if the initial assignment was fair (random draw), and then Z and Y agreed to a switch with compensation, that's a private agreement. But if the total rent per person is the same, and the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author is effectively paying less to the landlord. But if the room sizes are different, the initial equal split might not be fair. \n\nIn some roommate situations, people split rent based on room size. If they didn't do that, but the author is now getting $30 from Y, which would make their share lower. However, the author's room is smaller. So the author is making money from Y to give up the big room. But if X is in a smaller room and paying the same as everyone else, maybe X is the one who's paying more for a smaller room. \n\nWait, but the author is in a smaller room now, so if they were in the big room and then gave it up for $30, their rent should actually be lower. However, if the total rent is split equally among three, and the author is in a smaller room but still paying the same as before, maybe the author isn't actually paying less. The confusion here is whether the $30 is a payment from Y to Z, or if it's a payment from Y to the landlord. \n\nIf the total rent is split equally, and Y is paying Z $30, then Y is paying more in total, Z is paying less, and X is paying the same. But if the rooms are of different sizes, the original equal split might not be fair. So Z's action might be considered fair if they're compensating Y for the room size difference, but since they agreed that the person in the bigger room would pay more, and the initial assignment was random, but then Y took over the bigger room by paying Z, perhaps Z is just being paid for the room's value. \n\nHowever, if the author is now in a smaller room but still paying the same as others, and Y is in the bigger room but paying more, that could be considered fair. But X is still paying their original share, which might be higher than their room's proportion. But X's argument is that Z is getting a cheaper rent because of the room size. \n\nWait, but if Z is in a smaller room, their fair share of the rent would be less than if they were in the bigger room. But since the total rent is split equally, maybe the author is actually paying more than their fair share. However, the author is getting $30 from Y, which would make their effective payment lower. \n\nSo if the author is in a smaller room and gets $30 from Y, their total payment is less than X's. But if the initial agreement was that the big room would be assigned by chance, and then later the author gets a side payment from Y to switch, is that acceptable? \n\nThe problem is that X wasn't part of this negotiation. The author and Y made the deal without consulting X. If all three roommates had agreed that whoever got the big room would pay more, then Z's action might be okay. But if the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, and Z is now taking an extra $30, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut X's issue is that Z is paying less, but the author's room is smaller. So if the author is in a smaller room and paying less, that's fair. However, the author is taking $30 from Y to give up the big room, which was initially assigned by chance. \n\nWait, but the author was in the big room and gave it up for $30. So Y is now in the big room and paying $30 more than the author. But if the original rent split was equal, then Y's total payment is $X/3 + $30, while Z's is $X/3 - $30. X is still paying $X/3. \n\nIf the big room is 40% larger, then the author might have been paying less than their fair share when in the big room. But after the switch, Z is in a smaller room and should be paying less, which they are (since they get $30 from Y). However, the problem is that the author is now in a smaller room but the rent is split equally, so perhaps X is the one who's overpaying. \n\nBut if the author is getting $30 from Y, that $30 is part of the rent adjustment. So the author is effectively paying the same as before, but Y is paying $30 more. However, since Y is in the bigger room, that $30 could be considered a fair adjustment. \n\nBut X is upset because he's paying the same as Z, even though his room is the same size as Z's. Wait, no. The author gave up the big room to Y for $30. So Z is now in a smaller room (along with X), but Z is taking $30 from Y. So Y is in the big room and paying $30 more, while Z and X are in smaller rooms but paying the same as before (but Z is getting $30). \n\nSo from the landlord's perspective, the total rent is split equally. But from the roommate agreement, Y is paying Z $30 to take the big room. Therefore, Z's net payment is lower, and Y's is higher. However, the size difference might mean that the per-square-foot cost is different. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't involve X in the negotiation. If the original agreement was that whoever gets the big room pays more, but that wasn't established with X, then maybe X is under the impression that the rent should be split equally regardless of room size. \n\nSo when the author gave up the big room to Y for $30, they might have done so without considering that X is in the same room size as Z and still paying the same. However, if the author is in a smaller room and gets $30 from Y, that $30 could be a way to balance the rent based on room size. \n\nBut if the author is not paying the landlord less and just pocketing the $30 from Y, then the author is indeed making a profit. However, if the author is supposed to forward that $30 to the landlord to make their rent share equal again, then the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is scamming the roommates. The key is whether the author is being deceptive. The author didn't lie during the initial assignment; they used a fair method. Then, when Y approached to switch, the author made a deal. But if the deal causes their own rent to be lower than the others, especially if the rent wasn't split by room size, then the author might be taking advantage. \n\nIn many roommate situations, the rent is split based on room size. If that wasn't the case, and the author is now being compensated by Y for the room size, that might still not be fair to X if X is not getting the same consideration. \n\nSo the author and Y made a side agreement without involving X, and now Z is paying less than X, even though they have the same room size. That could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the rent distribution or for not involving X in the decision. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was in the big room and gave it up for $30, which is a fair compensation, then Z's action is justified. But the problem is that the author is now in a smaller room and receiving $30, which might make their effective rent lower. \n\nBut the original point of the bid was to have the person who could pay the most get the big room, but they opted for a random draw instead. Then, when Y wanted the room, the author agreed to a $30 payment. If that $30 is meant to reflect the value of the big room, then Z is getting compensation for their loss. \n\nHowever, if the original rent split was equal, then Z is not actually losing anything. The author was already in the big room, and now Y is paying them to switch. So the author is getting $30 from Y, which is a private agreement, but perhaps the author should have adjusted the rent split among all three roommates. \n\nThe issue here is that the author and Y's agreement affects X as well. Since the rent is split equally, X is still paying the same as everyone else, but Z is getting $30. So X is paying the same as Z (who is in a smaller room) but for a room of the same size as Z's. \n\nThis is confusing. If Z is in a smaller room and gets $30 from Y, then Z's total payment is less than X's. But if the rooms for Z and X are the same size, then X should be paying the same as Z. However, since the author is getting $30 from Y, Z's net is less. \n\nThis might be a case where the author is acting within their rights in a private agreement with Y, but perhaps not considering that the rent should be adjusted so that all roommates pay according to their room's size. If the author is taking $30 from Y without adjusting the overall rent split, then maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, when roommates have different-sized rooms, the rent is split proportionally. If the initial agreement was to split equally, but a side deal is made where the person in the bigger room pays more, that could be seen as a fair adjustment. But since X is not part of this, he's still paying the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't ensure that the rent is split fairly among all three roommates, leading to X's dissatisfaction. The author and Y should have renegotiated the entire rent split considering room sizes. Instead, they made a side deal that doesn't account for X's situation, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the rent distribution properly when making the switch with Y, leading to X feeling disadvantaged. The author's agreement with Y to take $30 without adjusting the overall rent split creates an imbalance among all roommates, which is unfair to X.\n"
