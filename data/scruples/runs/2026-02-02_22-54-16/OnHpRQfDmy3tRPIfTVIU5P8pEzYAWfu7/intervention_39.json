Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about roommates sharing an apartment with three rooms of different sizes. The user, let's call them Z, moved in with X and Y. Before moving in, Y wanted the bigger room, but when it came to assigning it, they decided to randomize it using a website, and Z won. Then after three days, Y wanted the room more and Z offered to trade if Y paid $30 more per month. Y agreed, so now Y has the bigger room and pays $30 extra.\n\nNow X is mad, saying that Z is scamming him because Z is paying less rent. The question is if Z is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They used a random generator to assign the bigger room, which seems fair. Z didn't force anything; it was a mutual agreement. Then Y approached Z and they made a deal where Y pays extra. Since the total rent is shared, if Y pays more, Z would effectively be paying less. But X is upset because he didn't agree to this arrangement. \n\nIs it fair for X to be upset? The key point is whether the deal between Z and Y affects X's share of the rent. If the total rent is fixed, and Y is paying Z $30 extra, then Z is covering that $30 from their own money. But if the total rent is split equally among three people, and Y is paying more to Z, then the total amount paid by Y and Z to the landlord is the same, but Y is effectively paying more to Z. This might make X feel like he's paying more than others. Wait, no. If the total rent is split equally, each person pays a third. If Y gives Z $30, then Y's total payment is their third plus $30, while Z's is their third minus $30. X is still paying their third. So X isn't paying more; he's just not getting any extra. So maybe X is upset that Z is getting money, which he perceives as unfair. \n\nBut the original agreement between Z and Y was mutual. Unless the room assignment agreement was supposed to include all roommates, but in this case, the deal between Z and Y seems to be a private agreement. Unless the problem is that the room is being reassigned without X's consent. If the room size affects the rent split, but in this case, the rent split is fixed. The bigger room is being occupied by Y now, but the rent is split equally. Maybe X feels that the bigger room should be accounted for in the rent, but since they didn't split the rent by room size, Z's decision to let Y have the bigger room in exchange for $30 is their own business. \n\nHowever, in some places, room assignments and rent splitting can be a legal matter. If the lease is split equally and the rooms are different sizes, some jurisdictions require that the rent be adjusted accordingly. But the user didn't mention any legal aspect. They just did a random draw and then a private agreement. \n\nSo, is Z in the wrong? The initial agreement was fair, and then a mutual agreement between Z and Y. Unless there was an unspoken rule that all room assignments must be approved by all roommates, which is common in some situations. If the roommates had an agreement that any room changes require all to agree, then Z and Y might have broken that. But in this case, the user didn't mention such a rule. They just used a random generator and then negotiated a deal. \n\nTherefore, it seems like Z isn't in the wrong. The deal was mutual between Z and Y, and X is upset because he didn't get any benefit from it. But unless there's a rule that all room changes require consensus, Z isn't obligated to involve X. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
