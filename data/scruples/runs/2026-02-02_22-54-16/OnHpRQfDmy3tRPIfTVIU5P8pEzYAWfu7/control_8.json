Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. They moved in with two acquaintances and had a bigger room they wanted. Initially, Y wanted it too, but was concerned about fairness because the user has a higher income. They decided to roll a random number and the user won the big room. A few days later, Y changed their mind and wanted to pay $30 extra per month to switch. The user agreed, so Y pays $30 to the user each month for the big room. Now, X is upset because he's not being compensated for his smaller room, even though he was okay with the initial random assignment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. The user and Y decided on a random method, which is fair if both agree. Then Y wanted to switch, offering money. The user accepted, so that's a mutual agreement between two parties. However, X wasn't part of this negotiation. X might feel that since Y paid the user, he's now at a disadvantage. \n\nBut wait, when they first moved in, the user and Y decided to randomize, and X didn't object then. The user didn't take anything from X; the $30 is between Y and the user. X is now upset because he's in the same room size but paying the same rent. The user isn't taking extra money from X, just keeping the $30 from Y as a trade for the room. \n\nHowever, the apartment's total rent is split among three people. If the user is in the bigger room but paying $30 less than Y, that might mean the rent split isn't based on room size. Maybe they all agreed to split the rent equally, but the user is now getting a larger room for less because Y is compensating them. That could be seen as unfair to X, who's in a smaller room without any compensation. \n\nThe key points are: Did they agree on a rent split that accounts for room sizes? If they split the rent equally, and the user is keeping $30 from Y to stay in the bigger room, then effectively, the user is paying less than an equal share, which might not be fair to X. But if the initial agreement was that the random assignment would determine room allocation without adjusting rent, and the user and Y made a separate deal, then maybe it's okay. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong if the overall rent wasn't adjusted to account for room size differences. By keeping the $30 from Y, they're effectively making their own room cheaper compared to others. X didn't get a say in the initial randomization, but now he's being left out of a financial arrangement that affects the room's value. \n\nAlternatively, if the main rent is split equally and the $30 is on top as a separate payment for the room, then the user is just getting extra for their room, which is a side agreement. But in that case, the user's rent share should still be the same as Y's, which isn't the case here. \n\nSo the problem is that the user is receiving money from Y, which allows them to pay less overall rent than Y, but X is paying the same as before. X is upset because he's not getting any compensation. The user didn't involve X in the negotiations, which might be where the issue lies. \n\nIf the total rent is fixed, then the user and Y's side deal disrupts the fair distribution. The user is essentially profiting from their room, which isn't part of the original agreement. X's argument is that it's unfair he's not getting that extra $30. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't adjust the rent split to account for the room sizes, and the side payment is causing imbalance. \n\nBut if the $30 is just a transfer and the actual rent split isn't changed, then maybe it's okay. However, in practice, it's likely that the user is paying less than their fair share since Y is giving them money to switch. X's room is smaller, so he should be compensated, but he's not. The user's answer would be that it was their room initially and they agreed to switch for $30, but X wasn't part of that. \n\nThe legal or social norm here is that when roommates have different room sizes, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. If they didn't do that, and instead made a side deal where one roommate effectively pays more for a better room, the others might feel shortchanged. The user didn't consider X's position when negotiating the switch. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't ensure that the rent was split based on room sizes and didn't involve X in the process. Their arrangement between Y and themselves creates an unfair situation for X, who is not getting any compensation for his smaller room.\n"
