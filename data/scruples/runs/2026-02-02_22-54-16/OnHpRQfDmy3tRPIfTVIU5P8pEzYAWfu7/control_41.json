Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The setup is that there are three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the user asked the roommates who wanted the big room. One (Y) really wanted it, and the other (X) didn't care. The user wanted it too. They considered randomizing or auctioning it. Y said it wouldn't be fair if they auctioned because their income is lower. So they used a random number generator, and the user won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and asked to take the big room. The user agreed to trade if Y paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed, so now Y is in the big room, paying $30 more. But X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the user is paying less rent. X thinks the user is scamming him.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points here. First, the initial allocation was done via a random draw, which seems fair since both wanted the room and couldn't agree on auction. The user then allowed Y to take the room if they paid $30 extra. The problem arises because X feels shortchanged because he's not in the big room and the user is paying less.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the main issue is whether the initial agreement between the user and Y affected X's rights. Since all three roommates were sharing the rent, the size of the room might affect how the rent is divided. If the original agreement was that rent would be split equally regardless of room size, but now one roommate is paying more because of the room size, that could create an imbalance.\n\nBut in this case, the user and Y made an agreement where Y pays an extra $30 to the user each month for the bigger room. However, if the total rent is split equally among all three, then Y's extra $30 would be going to the user, not to the landlord. So in effect, the user is receiving an extra $30 from Y, while X is paying the same. That could be seen as unfair to X because the user is effectively getting a discount on their rent by receiving money from Y. \n\nAlternatively, if the original agreement was that each roommate pays an equal share of the total rent regardless of room size, then the user's arrangement with Y might be altering that agreement without X's consent. X might have expected that all rooms are equal in cost, so when the user starts getting money from Y, it's like the user is profiting from the bigger room, which X didn't agree to. \n\nAnother angle is that when the user agreed to let Y have the room for $30, they might not have considered that X would be affected. X might feel that the user didn't include him in the decision, leading to an unfair distribution. The user's actions could be seen as creating an unequal financial arrangement without the third roommate's consent, which might be considered unfair.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the room assignment was initially decided by a random draw, and then the user negotiated with Y to switch rooms for an extra payment, it's a private agreement between two parties. If X isn't part of that agreement, but the rent split remains the same, then perhaps it's not the user's fault. But if the rent split is supposed to be equal and the user is effectively getting a lower share by taking Y's money, that could be a problem.\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, if rooms are different in size, the rent is adjusted accordingly. If the user is getting an extra $30 from Y, but the total rent is split equally, then the user's net cost is lower, which might be unfair to X. Unless X was part of the agreement or the rent structure was adjusted to account for the different room sizes.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the initial arrangement between the user and Y respected the equal sharing of rent. If the user is profiting from the bigger room without the third roommate's knowledge or agreement, then X could feel wronged. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering how their agreement affects X's share of the rent.\n"
