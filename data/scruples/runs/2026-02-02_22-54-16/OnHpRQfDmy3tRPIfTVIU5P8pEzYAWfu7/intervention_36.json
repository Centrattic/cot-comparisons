Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this roommate situation. The scenario is about roommates sharing an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger, and there's a dispute over who gets it.\n\nSo, the author, along with roommates X and Y, moved in. Before moving in, they discussed who gets the big room. Y wanted it, but the author also wanted it. They considered randomizing or bidding. Y thought a bid wasn't fair because of income differences. So they used a random number generator, and the author won. Then, three days later, Y asked to switch, offering to pay $30 more rent. The author agreed, and now X is upset, claiming the author is scamming him because he's paying less rent for the same size room.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The initial agreement was a random draw, which the author won. Then Y later negotiated a switch by paying an extra $30. The author is being accused by X of scamming him because X feels the rent is unfair.\n\nNow, considering roommate agreements, typically, if there's a set rent split, everyone pays their share. But in this case, the author and Y adjusted the rent for the bigger room. However, X wasn't part of that negotiation. So the issue is whether the author had the right to make that deal without involving X.\n\nIn many roommate situations, especially when the rent isn't split equally, there's usually an agreement among all roommates. If the author and Y changed the rent split without informing X, that could be seen as unfair. The problem is that the initial arrangement was a random draw, which X might have accepted. Then, after the author moved into the big room, changing the deal without X's consent could disrupt the original agreement.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't take money from X; they took it from Y. However, X's complaint is that he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting a bigger room and paying less. So, maybe X thinks the rent should be split based on room size, and the author's deal with Y unilaterally changed that.\n\nAnother angle: if the total rent is split equally, but the author is effectively getting a bigger room for the same price, while Y is paying more for the same room, X feels like the author is getting an unfair advantage. But the author's deal with Y might be a way to balance that out. However, since X wasn't part of the deal, he might not agree with the arrangement.\n\nLegally, unless there's a written agreement, roommate dynamics can be tricky. What's fair often depends on mutual agreement. If the author didn't inform X about the $30 arrangement, it could be seen as behind his back, which might be the crux of the issue. The problem is that the author changed the arrangement between themselves and Y without including X, leading to X feeling excluded and wronged.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve all roommates in the decision, even if the deal was between them and Y. Roommate agreements should ideally involve all parties to maintain fairness and transparency. By making the deal with Y without X's input, the author might have created an imbalance that X perceives as unfair.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't include X in the arrangement, leading to perceived unfairness.\n"
