Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. \n\nFirst, the initial setup: three roommates moving into an apartment with one larger bedroom. The writer wanted the big room and faced competition from Y. They decided to use a random number generator, and the writer won. Then, Y later asked for the room again, offering to pay $30/month extra. The writer agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays extra. Now, X is upset because the writer is paying less rent.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The initial agreement was through a random draw, which seems fair. Then, after three days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30/month. The writer agreed, so it's a mutual agreement between two parties. However, X wasn't part of this negotiation. \n\nX is upset because he's paying the same rent as the writer but in a smaller room. But the problem is that the arrangement between the writer and Y didn't involve X. The original decision to use a random draw included all roommates, right? Wait, the initial question was about who would take the big room, and Y and the writer were the ones competing. X said he didn't care. So X wasn't part of the initial decision. Then, when Y approached the writer to trade, X wasn't involved. So the writer and Y made a deal without X's input. \n\nBut X is now upset because he's paying the same as the writer. The issue here might be the fairness of the arrangement. If the total rent is split equally among the three, but the writer is effectively getting a discount because Y is paying extra to live in the bigger room. However, the arrangement between the writer and Y is a private agreement. The problem is whether this affects X's rights. \n\nIs it fair for the writer to accept money from Y to take the bigger room, effectively creating a situation where two roommates have different room sizes and different contributions? If the total rent is fixed, and the extra $30 from Y is going to the writer, then the writer is benefiting, but X is not. However, the initial agreement was random, and the writer had the right to the room until Y offered to pay for it. \n\nBut the problem is that the arrangement between the writer and Y changes the dynamics for X. X might feel that the rent should be adjusted based on room size. However, the original agreement was to split rent equally. The writer and Y's deal is outside of that. So, if the total rent paid by each is the same, but the writer is receiving $30 from Y, that's effectively reducing the writer's share. But if the total rent is split equally, then the writer is still paying their share, and the extra from Y is personal. \n\nBut X might argue that the rent should be adjusted based on room size. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the rent should be split proportionally. However, the initial agreement was to split equally. The writer and Y's arrangement is a side deal, but if the total rent is still divided equally, then X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting money from Y. So the writer is effectively getting a discount, which X is not. \n\nIs that fair? It depends on the original agreement. Since there was no prior agreement about room sizes affecting rent, the writer and Y's deal is their own. However, X might feel that the arrangement is unfair because he's not involved. But if the total rent paid by each is the same, then X is paying his share, and the writer is getting money from Y. But if the writer is using that $30 towards their own rent, that's reducing the writer's effective rent. But if the total rent is fixed, then the writer's total payment is their own share minus $30, but that's not part of the overall rent split. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is in how the rent is structured. If the total rent is split equally among the three, then each pays the same amount. The writer and Y's deal is a private matter where Y pays an extra $30 to the writer, which is separate from the rent. So the total rent each pays is the same, but Y is giving extra money to the writer. That could be seen as unfair to X, who isn't part of this. \n\nBut in reality, the writer is not receiving the $30 from the landlord; it's a side agreement between Y and the writer. So from the landlord's perspective, the rent is split equally. However, between the roommates, Y is paying the writer an extra $30. This could be considered unfair to X, who isn't receiving any compensation. \n\nBut the original agreement was to split rent equally. If the writer and Y made a deal without X's knowledge, then X has a right to be upset. However, the initial decision about room assignments was made via lottery, which X didn't contest. Now, after the fact, X is upset because the arrangement is affecting the rent split. \n\nSo, the key issue is whether the writer had the right to accept payment from Y for the room, thereby creating an imbalance in the room sizes and the financial arrangement. If the rent was supposed to be equal, then the writer's action of getting money from Y for the room might be seen as unfair to X. However, since the writer and Y made a mutual agreement, and X wasn't part of it, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a fairness issue for X.\n\nBut if the total amount each roommate pays is the same, then the writer isn't scamming X. The problem is that X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting money from Y. If the $30 is being used to reduce the writer's rent, then X is effectively subsidizing the writer, but if the $30 is just a separate payment not affecting the overall rent, then it's a private matter. \n\nHowever, the way it's presented in the story is that Y agreed to pay 30$ of the writer's rent. So if the total rent each pays is the same, but the writer is getting money from Y, then the writer's actual payment is less, which could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong because the deal was between two parties who agreed to it. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that X is now affected. The answer might depend on whether the deal between Y and the writer was transparent and fair to X. Since X wasn't involved, but the deal affects the room's usage and potential rent distribution, the writer might be in the wrong for not considering X's perspective or ensuring fairness in the arrangement.\n"
