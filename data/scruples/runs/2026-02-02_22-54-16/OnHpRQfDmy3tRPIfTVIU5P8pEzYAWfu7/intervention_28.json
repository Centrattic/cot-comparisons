Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for arranging a deal where they get an extra $30 from their roommate Y to switch rooms. The roommates are split on a three-bedroom apartment, with one room significantly larger.\n\nFirst, the setup: Before moving in, there was a random selection for the big room because they wanted to be fair. The author won the random draw and took the big room. Then, after three days, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay an extra $30/month for it. The author agreed, so Y moved into the big room and the author now pays $30 less.\n\nNow, the conflict is that roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. X feels it's unfair that the author isn't sharing the savings. The author argues that the initial agreement was between them and Y, and X wasn't involved in that decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider fairness and agreement. The initial agreement was a fair random selection, which everyone agreed to. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author and Y made a mutual agreement. However, the problem arises because X is now in a worse position. The author didn't consult X about the switch, but X wasn't part of the initial room assignment. \n\nThe key point is whether the room assignments affect X's living situation. If the rooms are separate and X's room isn't affected by the swap, except for the rent, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the arrangement impacts X's rent split, then perhaps the author should have involved X.\n\nWait, the total rent is split among all three roommates. If Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, that might change the overall rent structure. For example, if the total rent is $X, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, does that mean the author's share of the rent is lower? If so, then X is paying the same amount but the author is getting less, which could create an unfair distribution unless all roommates agreed to it.\n\nHowever, the initial agreement was between the author and Y. If the total rent paid to the landlord remains the same, and the $30 is just a side agreement between the author and Y, then X isn't part of that. But if the $30 reduces the author's contribution to the overall rent, that could affect how the rent is split. For example, maybe X is paying a third of the total rent, and the author is effectively getting a discount because Y is covering part of it. That might be unfair to X.\n\nBut the story says that the author now pays $30 less in rent. So if the total rent is $T, and originally each paid $T/3, now the author pays $T/3 - $30, and Y pays $T/3 + $30, while X still pays $T/3. That would mean the author is saving $30 and Y is paying an extra $30, which seems fair between them. However, X is not part of that arrangement, so he's in the same room but not receiving any benefit. That could be why he's upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author had to involve X in the initial agreement. If the room switch only affects the author and Y, and the rent adjustment is a private agreement, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the rent split as a whole is affected, and X is now paying more in an unfair way, then maybe the author is at fault for not getting X's agreement.\n\nBut the problem is that the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X. If the total rent to the landlord remains the same, but the author's share is reduced because Y is paying extra, that could mean X is effectively subsidizing the author's room. However, if the agreement is that Y is paying the author directly, not the landlord, then the author's share to the landlord is lower, and X remains the same. In that case, the author is receiving a personal benefit from Y, which might not be fair to X if the arrangement affects the overall rent distribution.\n\nBut the story doesn't mention that the total rent paid to the landlord changed. It says the author now pays $30 less, which implies that the author is getting a discount from Y, perhaps through a private agreement. If that's the case, then X's payment to the landlord remains the same, but the author is getting a personal discount. However, if the room assignment and rent splits are supposed to be equal, then the author's arrangement with Y could be seen as creating an unfair advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if the arrangement affects the overall fairness of the rent split among all roommates without their consent. However, if the agreement between the author and Y is a separate, private deal that doesn't alter the total rent paid to the landlord and only affects their internal arrangements, then the author might not be in the wrong. The key is whether the deal between the author and Y is affecting X's financial burden without his agreement. If X is paying the same as before but the author is saving $30, that could be unfair to X. But if the total rent is adjusted accordingly so that X isn't subsidizing the author, then it's fair. The story isn't entirely clear on this, but based on the information given, the author might be in the right if the deal is a separate agreement between them and Y, and the total rent to the landlord remains the same. However, if the deal causes X to pay more relative to the others, then the author is in the wrong.\n"
