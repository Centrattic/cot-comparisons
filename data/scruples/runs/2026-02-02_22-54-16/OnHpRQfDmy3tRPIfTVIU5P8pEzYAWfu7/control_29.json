Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that three people moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. One is significantly bigger. Before moving in, the author wanted to know who would take the big room. The roommate Y really wanted it, but was concerned about fairness because the author has a higher income. The author suggested a random method (using a website) to decide, and they did that, so the author got the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and asked the author to give up the room if Y pays $30 extra each month. The author agreed, and now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent. X is accusing the author of scamming him, saying it's unfair since they both have the same square meters but different rent. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and the agreement between the roommates. Initially, they used a random method to assign rooms, which Y agreed to. Then, after Y changed their mind, the author allowed Y to take the room in exchange for $30 extra. But X wasn't part of that decision, so he's upset.\n\nFirst, when they first assigned the room, it was randomized because Y thought the higher bidder might have an unfair advantage. The author went along with that. So the initial assignment was fair by mutual agreement. Then, Y later wanted to switch, and the author made a deal where Y pays more. That could be seen as a private agreement between the author and Y. However, X is now paying the same as the author, but in a smaller room, which makes him feel it's unfair.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the original rent was split among three people. If the author is now effectively paying less per month, the others are paying more. But the author and Y made a deal. Did they involve X in the discussion? The author says they didn't take it up with X. So maybe the issue is that the original agreement didn't consider how the rent would be adjusted if someone wanted to switch rooms. The problem arises because the $30 difference isn't being accounted for in a way that affects X's share. \n\nIf the total rent is split evenly, then the author's share is less because they accepted the payment from Y. But if the total rent is fixed, and the author is not increasing their portion compared to the others, then X might be right to feel that the author is getting an unfair advantage. However, if the author and Y's agreement was that Y would cover the $30 difference, then it's a side deal. But maybe X wasn't part of that decision, so he didn't agree to the new arrangement, which is why he's upset.\n\nThe author didn't consult X when making the deal with Y. So even though the initial room assignment was fair, the subsequent agreement to adjust rent without X's input could be problematic. If the rent was supposed to be split equally, but now the author is getting a discount by allowing Y to pay them instead of contributing more to the total, that might be seen as unfair to X. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision and for effectively altering the rent structure without his consent.\n"
