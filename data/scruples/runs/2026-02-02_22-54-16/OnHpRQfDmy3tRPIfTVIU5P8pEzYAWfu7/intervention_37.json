Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and the subsequent payment arrangement.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates, one big room and two smaller ones. The person (let's call them Person A) wanted the big room. They discussed with Roommate Y, who initially wanted it but then decided a random draw (using random.org) would be fair. Person A won the draw and got the big room.\n\nThen, after a few days, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. Person A offered to trade if Y paid $30/month extra, which Y agreed to. Now, Roommate X is upset because he feels it's unfair that A is paying less rent even though their rooms are the same size.\n\nSo, the question is whether A is at fault. The user thinks A is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI need to evaluate based on fairness, agreements made, and roommate dynamics. The initial allocation was done via a random draw, which both Y and A agreed to. Then, when Y wanted to change, A proposed a payment arrangement that Y accepted. So, the agreement between A and Y was mutual and consensual. \n\nRoommate X wasn't part of that agreement. If X was part of the original arrangement or expected a different setup, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the original decision-making involved Y and A, not X. X's complaint is that A is paying less rent, but since X didn't participate in the negotiation, it's unclear if he's part of the same agreement.\n\nIn roommate situations, unless the lease terms are split equally, roommates often negotiate based on room sizes. If the big room is worth more, it's common to adjust rent accordingly. However, if all three are splitting the rent equally, but one is paying extra to switch rooms, that could create an imbalance. But in this case, Y is paying $30 extra to A, which might mean A's share is reduced by $30, or Y's total is higher. The exact financial arrangement isn't clear, but the key point is that the trade was between Y and A, and X wasn't involved. \n\nX's anger seems to stem from not being included in the decision, but since the initial allocation and the subsequent trade were between Y and A, X's complaint is about a situation he wasn't part of. Unless the group had a prior agreement that all room assignments and rent adjustments require consensus, A and Y could have made their own deal. If the lease is a joint one where all pay equal shares, then A receiving $30 from Y might be an informal arrangement, which X isn't part of. \n\nHowever, in many cases, roommates should communicate and agree on such arrangements. If X wasn't informed or involved, it might be seen as unfair to him. But the question is about whether A is in the wrong. Since A and Y made a mutual agreement, unless there was a prior agreement that all room assignments need consensus, A isn't in the wrong. X's grievance is more about feeling excluded rather than A acting dishonestly. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are mutual agreement between Y and A, and the lack of X being part of that agreement. Unless the original setup required group consensus, A's actions are justified."
