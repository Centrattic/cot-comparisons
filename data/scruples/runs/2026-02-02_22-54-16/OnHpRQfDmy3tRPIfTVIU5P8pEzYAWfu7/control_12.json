Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and the big room. The author and two roommates, X and Y, moved into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, everyone was supposed to decide who gets the big room. The author and Y wanted it. Y didn't want to pay more because he has lower income, so they randomized it with a website, and the author got it.\n\nThen, after three days, Y wanted the big room too and offered to pay $30/month to the author to switch. The author agreed, so Y gets the big room and pays $30 extra to the author. Now X is angry because he thinks the author is taking advantage by getting $30 less rent. He says the author is scamming him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, they decided through random.org who gets the big room. The author got it. Then, Y approached and wanted it, so they made a deal. The author charges Y $30/month to give up the big room. But X is upset because he's not part of this deal. He thinks it's unfair that he's paying the same rent as Y but the author gets $30 less.\n\nIs the author allowed to make that deal? Well, the initial agreement was random, and the author had the right to the big room. Y wanted to take it over and the author agreed to a financial arrangement. If all parties involved (author and Y) consented, then it's a private agreement. But X isn't part of that deal, so he's not getting any money. But X is paying the same rent as Y, but the author is getting $30 less. That might seem unfair to X because he feels the author is benefiting from the deal without him.\n\nBut maybe the key is whether the original rent split was based on room size. If the rent was divided equally regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y might create an imbalance. However, if the original agreement was that the big room was allocated via random.org, then the author's decision to transfer the big room in exchange for money is a separate agreement. The problem arises if the overall rent is not adjusted accordingly. For example, if the total rent is split equally among all three, but the author is getting $30 from Y, that might mean Y is effectively paying more in total. But if the original rent was split as per room, then maybe the author's room was cheaper, but then transferring the room would mean Y is paying more. \n\nWait, the author says that Y agreed to pay $30 of the author's rent. So perhaps the initial rent was split based on room size? If the big room was part of the total rent, maybe the author's rent was higher. But the author says that after the deal, Y pays $30 to the author, so maybe the author's rent was reduced by $30. But if X's rent stayed the same, then X is paying the same as before, but Y is paying more. But since X isn't getting any money, he feels he's being treated unfairly.\n\nThe issue is whether the original room assignment and the subsequent deal between the author and Y are fair to X. If the original agreement didn't involve X in the negotiation, and X didn't consent to the financial arrangement, then X might feel it's unfair. The author might be in the wrong if the deal affects X's share of the rent or if the overall arrangement isn't transparent.\n\nBut if the total rent remains the same and the $30 is just a transfer between the author and Y, then maybe the author isn't scamming anyone. However, if the author's rent was reduced by $30, then the total rent paid by Y and the author would be the same as before, but X's portion remains the same. That could make X feel like he's paying more relative to Y, even though the total rent is split among all three. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's rent was supposed to be based on room size, and the author received $30 from Y, then the author's rent might have been adjusted. But without X's consent, perhaps the author should have involved X in the initial decision. Maybe X expected that the big room would be allocated in a way that affects everyone's rent, so excluding him from the negotiation could be the problem.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because the deal with Y affects the overall rent structure without X's input. Even if the author and Y agreed on the $30, X's situation is now different, and the author didn't consider X's perspective. The key point is whether the author's arrangement with Y is fair to X. Since X is paying the same rent but the author is getting money from Y, X feels it's unfair. The author might have a responsibility to ensure that such arrangements are equitable among all roommates, not just those directly involved in the deal. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the deal impacts X without his agreement, leading to perceived unfairness.\n"
