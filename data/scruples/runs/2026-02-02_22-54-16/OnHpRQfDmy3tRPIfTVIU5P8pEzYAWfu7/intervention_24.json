Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for charging their roommate $30 a month to switch rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. One is 40% bigger. Before moving in, they had a discussion about who gets the big room. The two roommates, X and Y. The user wanted the big room, Y wanted it too, but when the user suggested a bid or a random draw, Y didn't want to bid because of income inequality. So they did a random.org roll, and the user won. So the big room was assigned to them via random selection.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back asking to switch, and the user agrees if Y pays $30/month. Now, X is upset because he's in the same size room but the user is paying less. X is calling the user a scammer and being unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong here. Let me think about the possible angles. The key points are: initial agreement, fairness of the process, and whether the user's action disadvantaged X.\n\nInitially, the big room was assigned via a random draw. That's a fair method, so the user had the right to the room. Then Y wanted to switch, and they made a mutual agreement where Y takes the room by paying $30 more. The user is giving up their allocated room in exchange for money. Now X is upset because he's not part of this deal and feels it's unfair since he's in a smaller room and pays the same as Y.\n\nBut wait, the rent for the apartment\u2014how is it divided? If the total rent is split equally among the three, then the user is getting $30 less from Y, so effectively, the user is paying $30 less than Y, while X is paying the same as he did before. But X is in the same size room as the user, so he's paying the same rent as the user. However, Y is now in the bigger room and paying $30 more than the user. But how does the rent split work?\n\nIf the total rent is divided equally, and Y is paying the user $30, then maybe Y's total payment is the same as before. Let me think. Suppose the total rent is $X. Each pays X/3. The user was in the big room, but now Y is in the big room and paying the user $30. So the user's share is X/3 - $30, and Y's share is X/3 + $30. But X is still paying X/3. So in this case, the user is effectively paying less rent, while Y is paying more. But X is in the same room as the user, so he's paying the same as the user. But why is X upset?\n\nX is upset because he's paying the same as the user but the user is getting the $30 from Y. If the total rent is the same for all, but the user is getting $30 from Y, then the user's net contribution is less. But if the initial rent is split equally, and Y is paying the user $30, then the user is effectively paying $30 less. But X is in the same room as the user, so he's paying the same as the user. Therefore, X is paying more in total compared to the user, but he's in the same size room. Wait, no. If the rent is split equally, all three pay the same amount. If Y pays the user $30, then Y's total is the same as the others, but the user is receiving $30. So in this case, the user is getting money from Y, which reduces their own contribution. But the total rent remains the same. So the user's net payment to the landlord is less, while Y's is the same. But X is paying the same as before. So X is paying the same as the user, but the user is getting $30 from Y, making the user's net payment $30 less. So X is in the same room as the user, but the user is paying less. That's the reason for X's anger.\n\nIs that fair? From a fairness standpoint, if the rent is supposed to be split equally, and the user is getting $30 from Y, then the user's share is cheaper. But if the user is in a smaller room, and X is in the same size room, then why is the user paying less? Because the agreement was that the user gave up the big room in exchange for $30. So Y is in the big room, paying more. The user is in a smaller room, getting $30. X is in a smaller room, paying the same as the user.\n\nBut X is in the same room as the user. So why is he upset? He might feel that if the user is in a smaller room and paying less, then he, X, who is also in a smaller room, should also pay less. But the user is in a smaller room because he gave up the big one for money. So the user is compensating for the room size by getting money from Y. But X is in a smaller room and not getting any compensation. So X is paying the same as the user, who is in a smaller room but getting $30. So X is effectively paying more than the user for the same room. That's the crux of the problem.\n\nWait, no. If the user is in a smaller room and receiving $30 from Y, then the user's net payment is less. But X is in a smaller room and paying the same as before. So X is paying the same as the user, who is in the same size room but getting $30. So X is effectively paying more than the user for the same room. That's why X is upset. Because he's in the same room as the user, but the user is getting a discount through the agreement with Y. That's perceived as unfair by X.\n\nSo is the user in the wrong? The user made a private agreement with Y. The initial allocation was via random draw, which was fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the user agreed to let him take the room for $30 more. That's a private agreement between two roommates. However, this affects the third roommate, X, because the rent distribution changes in a way that affects him. If the initial agreement was that everyone pays the same rent regardless of room size, then this deal might be seen as unfair. But if the rent was intended to be split based on room size, then the user's agreement with Y could be fair.\n\nBut in the scenario, the initial problem was that the big room was to be allocated, and the user got it via random. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the user allowed it for $30. The problem is that X wasn't part of the initial agreement and now feels that the user is getting an unfair advantage by getting $30 from Y, leading to the user paying less than Y, while X is in the same room as the user. \n\nSo the key issue is whether the user is allowed to make a private agreement that affects the rent distribution in a way that disadvantages another roommate. If the three had agreed beforehand that everyone would pay the same rent regardless of room size, then the user's action might be violating that agreement. However, if there was no such agreement, and room size wasn't considered in rent splitting, then the user's action might be within their rights.\n\nBut in this case, the initial allocation of the big room was done via a random draw, which implies that the room sizes weren't factored into rent. The user and Y made a private agreement to switch rooms with a monetary compensation. However, this compensation affects the rent that Y is paying to the landlord, leading to Y paying more, the user paying less, and X paying the same. Since X is in the same room as the user, he feels that he should also be compensated for being in a smaller room, but he isn't. Therefore, X is upset that the user is getting $30 from Y, making the user's net payment less than Y's, while X's is the same as the user's.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The user made a fair initial allocation via random draw. Then allowed a switch with compensation. However, the compensation creates an inequity in how much each roommate is paying relative to their room size. If the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the user's action could be seen as unfair to X, because X is in a smaller room but paying the same as the user, who is in a smaller room but getting a discount. \n\nBut if the roommates never agreed on how rent would be split in relation to room size, then the user's action might be acceptable. However, since the user is now effectively paying less than Y for the same room size, while X is paying the same as the user, it's possible that the user is in the wrong if the intent was for everyone to pay the same. Alternatively, if the user is in a smaller room and Y is in a bigger one, the user's compensation from Y could be seen as fair, similar to a rent adjustment based on room size. However, since X is in the same room as the user, but not getting any compensation, that's where the problem lies.\n\nAnother angle is that the user and Y's agreement is between them, but it affects the third roommate. So without involving X in the discussion, the user might be at fault. The user could have brought X into the conversation to ensure that the rent distribution remains fair for everyone. By not doing so, the user may have created an unfair situation for X. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong (A) because the private agreement between user and Y created an unequal payment structure that disadvantages X, without X's consent or involvement. Alternatively, if the user's agreement was that they would take the room in exchange for $30, and the total rent remains the same, then maybe it's not the user's fault (B). But the key is that X is now paying the same as the user, but the user is effectively paying less because of the $30. So X is paying more than the user for the same room. That's the core issue. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because their private agreement created an inequity for X without his consent. So answer A."
