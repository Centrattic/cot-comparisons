Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates and splitting rent, specifically regarding the bigger room. \n\nFirst, the setup: The apartment has three bedrooms, with the biggest one being 40% larger. When moving in, the author and roommates X and Y were deciding who gets the big room. The author wanted it and proposed a bid or a random draw. Y argued that since the author has a higher income, it wouldn't be fair. They did a random draw through random.org, and the author won. So initially, the author got the big room through a fair process that both agreed on.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed their mind and asked what it would take for the author to give up the room. The author offered a deal: if Y pays $30 extra each month, then Y can take the big room. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming them by getting a cheaper rent for the same-sized room. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and prior agreement. The initial allocation was done via a random draw, which was fair and agreed upon. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author required Y to pay $30 more. The author isn't changing the deal; they agreed on this payment when Y approached them. Since X didn't participate in that negotiation and the original agreement was between the author and Y, maybe X feels left out. But the author didn't owe X a say in that particular transaction. \n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the apartment's total rent is split equally, so if the author is in a bigger room but paying less, that might feel unfair to X. But the author is still paying the same as X, just the deal with Y is that Y covers $30 of the author's rent. So effectively, Y is paying more in total, not the author. The author isn't scamming X because they followed the initial agreement and then negotiated a fair deal when Y wanted to switch. \n\nX might be upset because they didn't get a chance to bid or negotiate, but the author didn't invite X into that discussion. The author's action seems within their rights since the initial allocation was random and the subsequent agreement was made with Y's consent. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
