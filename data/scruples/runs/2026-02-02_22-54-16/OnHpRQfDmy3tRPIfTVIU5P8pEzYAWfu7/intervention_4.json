Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. \n\nSo, the setup is that there are three roommates: the author, X, and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author and Y wanted the bigger room. X didn't care. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won. But then after a few days, Y wanted the big room for his bed and offered to pay $30 extra each month to the author in exchange for switching. The author agreed. Now X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting $30 less, which X thinks is unfair.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial decision to use a random number generator seems fair. Both the author and Y wanted the room, so using a random method resolved it without bias. The author got the big room. Then Y comes back after a few days and wants to switch, offering money. The author agrees to let Y have the room in exchange for $30/month. \n\nX's main argument is that it's unfair that the author is paying less rent now, even though X and the author have the same-sized rooms. But the problem is that the rent split wasn't adjusted based on room size. Typically, in shared housing, if rooms are different sizes, rent is divided accordingly. However, in this case, they might have split the rent equally regardless. The author and Y arranged a private agreement where Y pays the author $30/month, effectively making the author's rent lower by that amount. \n\nIs this a problem? If the original agreement was that the big room was assigned randomly, but no one considered that room sizes affect rent, then maybe there's an issue. If the total rent is being split equally, then the author getting money from Y would mean that the author's effective rent is lower, which might not be fair to X. Because X is still paying the same, while the author is effectively paying less. But if the total rent was split equally, and the author is getting money from Y, then that could be seen as the author profiting from the arrangement, which might be why X is upset. \n\nBut wait, if the author and Y arranged this\u79c1\u4e0b (privately), and X wasn't part of the discussion, maybe X didn't have a say. However, since the rent is a shared expense, any private arrangement that affects the overall fairness could be problematic. For example, if the author is getting $30 from Y, but the total rent remains the same, then technically the author is getting a discount, which might not be fair to X who is paying the same as before. \n\nAnother angle: the original decision to use randomness was fair. The author then allowed Y to take the room in exchange for money. The issue is whether this private agreement is affecting X's share of the rent. If the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting money from Y, then X is effectively subsidizing the author's lower rent. That could be seen as unfair. However, if the original agreement was that each roommate pays an equal share of the total rent, then the author's receiving money from Y is their personal arrangement. But since the rent is a shared responsibility, maybe it's not appropriate to have a side deal that affects others' shares. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the roommates didn't agree on how to allocate rent based on room size. If the bigger room's value is higher, perhaps the rent should be split accordingly. The author might have assumed they'd keep the bigger room's value, but by allowing Y to switch with money, they're adjusting the rent privately. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the initial agreements. If they agreed to equal rent splits regardless of room size, then the author's taking money from Y could be seen as creating an imbalance. But if the original agreement allowed for room assignments to be adjusted with side payments, then it's okay. \n\nThe author didn't take money from X; they had a fair process initially. Then Y wanted to switch and offered money. The author agreed, which might be fair between them, but since it affects X's rent, maybe X should have a say. Or maybe not, because X's room size hasn't changed, and the rent split was equal. The author's effective rent is lower, but X's is the same. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they followed a fair initial process and then allowed a mutual agreement between themselves and Y. However, X's grievance is about the perceived unfairness of the rent split. The problem is whether the side agreement is valid given that the overall rent isn't adjusted. If the author is effectively getting a discount, that's a problem for X. But if the original rent split was equal regardless of room size, then maybe the author isn't at fault. The answer hinges on the initial agreements and whether room size affects rent. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the author and Y made a mutual agreement after the initial fair assignment, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
