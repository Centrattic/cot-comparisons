Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about the big room in the apartment. Initially, they had a random draw where the person (let's say person A) got the bigger room. Then after a few days, roommate Y wanted it more and offered to pay $30 extra each month for it. A agreed. Now roommate X is upset because he's paying the same rent but has a smaller room.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement: they had a random draw, which both Y and A agreed to, and A won. So that's fair. Then Y comes in later, wants the room, and offers to pay an extra $30. A agreed, so Y now has the room. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. X is upset because he's paying the same rent but has a smaller room. \n\nWait, but if the rent was split equally among all three roommates, then Y is paying extra to A to get the big room. So maybe the total rent for the apartment is split equally, but Y gives A an extra $30 to compensate for the bigger room. That would mean A is effectively getting $30 less from the total rent, but since A is in the big room, maybe the rent was already split equally. Hmm, maybe the problem is that X isn't part of that arrangement and feels like he's being shortchanged.\n\nBut the original agreement between A and Y was that Y would pay A $30/month. If that's agreed upon by both parties, then it's a private arrangement. However, if X's rent isn't being adjusted, then X might feel like he's paying more because the total cost is the same but he's in a smaller room. Wait, no, the total rent for the apartment is fixed. Let's say the total rent is $R per month. Each person pays $R/3. Then Y gives A $30, so A's net is $R/3 - $30, but Y's net is $R/3 + $30. But X is still paying $R/3. So X's payment is unchanged. X might feel that the arrangement is unfair because he's not getting the same compensation as A. But the problem is that the private agreement between A and Y is separate from the original rent split.\n\nBut maybe the issue is that the rent division wasn't adjusted. If the big room was worth more, perhaps the rent should have been split differently. However, initially, they just had a random draw for the big room. Then when Y wanted to take it, A agreed to a compensation. But X wasn't part of that. So X's problem is that he's not involved in the decision and feels he's being treated unfairly. \n\nIs A in the wrong? Well, roommates often have informal arrangements, but if the rent wasn't adjusted to account for the room sizes, then maybe A shouldn't have accepted the $30. But since A was the one who got the big room via the random draw, and then Y offered to pay for it, it's a private agreement. However, if the total rent wasn't adjusted to reflect the room sizes, then maybe the initial setup was unfair. But the problem here is that the agreement between A and Y changes the dynamics for X. So X is upset because he feels left out of the negotiation and not compensated.\n\nThe key point is whether the arrangement between A and Y affects X's share. Since all three split the total rent equally, and X's payment isn't changing, but the room sizes are different, there's an imbalance. However, A's agreement with Y might be a way to compensate for the bigger room. But if X isn't part of that, then he's not getting any compensation. So maybe the author is in the wrong because the arrangement with Y creates an unfair situation for X. But the author didn't do anything illegal; it's just that the distribution is unequal. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because it's their right to do a private agreement with Y. However, the problem arises because X is now paying the same as Y but with a smaller room. The author's action causes X to be in a worse position. So maybe the author should have considered X's situation. But since the random draw was agreed upon by Y and A, and then the compensation was between A and Y, X's complaint is about the fairness of the overall arrangement. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement with Y creates an imbalance in the living conditions for X without his consent or compensation. Even though the agreement is between A and Y, it affects X's living situation. Therefore, the author should have involved X in the decision or adjusted the rent accordingly for everyone. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because it's their prerogative to accept compensation for the room they won.\n"
