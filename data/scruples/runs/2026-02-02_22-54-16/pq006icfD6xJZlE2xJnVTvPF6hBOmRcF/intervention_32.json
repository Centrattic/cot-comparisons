We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The author is 29, and Justin is 20. They had been dating over a year, and she was cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, was awkward at first but became a sweetheart. She mentions she was poor and taking odd jobs. She moved in with him after losing her job, and he was her \"meal ticket.\" Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with Justin. He was devastated, and even when she tried to keep a friends-with-benefits relationship, he got angry. She moved out but feels bad. The question is, is she the asshole?\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. That's not huge, but Justin is 20, which is still a young age. The author was relying on him financially when she lost her job and moved in. But then she got a better job and became more stable. She broke up because she didn't love him the way he did. It's important to note that she was honest with him and even tried to console him. Justin was devastated, but was the breakup justified?\n\nThe key points here are the financial dependency and the emotional aspect. If she was using him for financial support and then left him after securing her own, that could be seen as selfish. However, she states she didn't love him like he did, which is a valid reason for a breakup. Also, she tried to offer a friendship and he was upset, but that's his reaction. She moved out, which is her right. \n\nBut the problem might be the lack of emotional investment. If she was in a relationship where she didn't have feelings but he did, that's a two-way street. However, she was upfront about it. But maybe she should have been more considerate of his dependence on her. Wait, but the situation is reversed. She was the one who needed financial help from Justin, so when she became stable, she wanted to leave. Justin had Asperger's, which might affect his ability to handle the breakup. \n\nThe community might have mixed views. Some could say she left him when he needed her, especially if he was emotionally attached. Others might argue that she was honest and made a choice for her own well-being. The term \"meal ticket\" suggests that she was relying on him financially, which could imply an imbalance. But she had a good reason to seek better opportunities. \n\nThe author tried to explain the breakup and offered a new arrangement, but he rejected it. She might not be in the wrong because staying in a relationship without love isn't fair to either party. However, the way she ended it could be questioned. But the main issue is whether she's the asshole. Since she was upfront and had her own reasons, and Justin's reaction is his own problem, I think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong. The relationship was casual, and she made a decision when her life improved. Justin's aspergers might make the breakup harder for him, but that doesn't make her the asshole.\n"
