We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a good job is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They were dating for over a year, she moved in with him, and he provided financial support when she was unemployed. Now that she has a better job, she broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman was in a job that paid poorly and had to take odd jobs. Justin, who is 20, is in a more stable financial position. She didn't love him as much as he loved her, and after securing a better job, she ended the relationship. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nLooking at the key points: She didn't love him, he was her financial support, but she moved on after gaining financial stability. The question is whether breaking up was justified. In relationships, mutual feelings and personal growth are important. If one person isn't reciprocating the emotional investment, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the timing might be questionable if she used his financial support to get her footing. But she mentions she didn't love him, so staying in an unloved relationship could be seen as unfair to him. \n\nAsperger's might affect his ability to understand the breakup, but that doesn't make her wrong. She tried to console him, which shows some consideration. The main issue is whether her actions were selfish. She didn't owe him a relationship just because he helped her financially. People have the right to pursue their happiness and life goals. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she led him on by moving in with him and accepting his support without loving him back. But if she was honest about her feelings, it's not her fault. The problem here is that she wasn't in love and realized it when she could support herself better. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because she ended an unreciprocated relationship for her own well-being after gaining financial independence. The answer should be B.\n"
