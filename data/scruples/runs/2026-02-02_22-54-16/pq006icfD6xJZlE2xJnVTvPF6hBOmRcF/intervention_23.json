We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex. The author, who's 29, was in a relationship with Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, she moved in with him, and she lost her job, relying on him financially. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if breaking up is wrong in this context. The author mentions she doesn't love him the way he does, which suggests the relationship wasn't balanced emotionally. Justin was providing financial support, but she didn't reciprocate the love. When she got a better job, she became more financially stable, which allowed her to leave. Breaking up because she's not in love isn't inherently wrong. People can't be forced into relationships they don't feel passionate about.\n\nHowever, the age gap is 9 years. Justin is 20 when she's 29. That might affect power dynamics. He's younger and has Asperger's, which could make him more vulnerable. She was in his apartment, moving in, and relying on him financially before her job improved. That might mean she had some responsibility towards him, but once she became self-sufficient, her duty might decrease.\n\nThe breakup led to Justin being devastated. The author tried to console him but he was angry. Maybe she didn't handle it the best way, but intentions matter. She's prioritizing her own happiness and independence after a situation where she was financially dependent on him. That's a valid reason to leave. She's not in love, so continuing the relationship would be unfair to both parties.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Breaking up isn't wrong if the relationship isn't working. She's not staying in an unhappy relationship for material support. Justin's reaction is sad, but that's on him. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship she doesn't want. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
