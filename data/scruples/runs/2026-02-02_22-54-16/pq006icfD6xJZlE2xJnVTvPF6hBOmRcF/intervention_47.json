We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman with a history of unstable jobs and financial struggles. She met Justin, a 20-year-old with Asperger's, who provided financial support, and they had a relationship that included moving in together and a sexual relationship. She got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up, leading to Justin's devastation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman was in a financially vulnerable position and relied on Justin for groceries, clothes, and housing. Their relationship started when she was cleaning his apartment, and it's implied that Justin might have been more emotionally invested from the beginning. The woman didn't feel the same depth of love but stayed in the relationship, perhaps due to her financial situation. Now that she's more stable, she's left him, which caused emotional distress.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are consent, communication, and mutual expectations. Did she ever clearly communicate that the relationship wasn't serious? The user mentioned she intended to tell him it was casual but didn't. That could be a problem because Justin might have thought they were in a committed relationship. Moving in together and having a sexual relationship without clear boundaries can lead to misunderstandings. If she didn't set those boundaries early, she might be at fault for not being honest about her intentions. However, if she felt pressured into the relationship by Justin or felt he wasn't emotionally available, that's another angle. The fact that Justin is 20 and she's 29 adds a power dynamic, as she's older and more experienced, which might place more responsibility on her to communicate her feelings honestly.\n\nAlso, the financial dependency is a factor. If she was relying on him for financial support and then left without a clear transition, that could be seen as leaving him in a worse position. However, she saved money through the job he provided, which might have allowed her to move out independently. The question is whether she had the right to end the relationship for her own reasons, even if it hurt him. In relationships, people can choose to end them for their own happiness or growth, even if it causes pain. But if there were misunderstandings about the relationship's nature, she could be seen as the asshole for not being upfront.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could swing either way. If she didn't set clear expectations early on and led him to believe there was a future together, she might be in the wrong. But if she did communicate her feelings and he didn't understand, or if she felt she needed to leave for her own well-being, then she's not. The fact that she tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement suggests she tried to mitigate the situation, but it backfired. The age difference and his Asperger's might mean he had difficulty reading her boundaries, which could shift some responsibility to him. However, she has the responsibility to communicate clearly. Given that she didn't set the relationship as casual from the start and moved in with him, leading him to believe it was more serious, she might be in the wrong. But if she felt she was being taken advantage of or needed to leave for her own financial independence, then it's justified. The answer hinges on whether she communicated her intentions honestly. Since the user mentioned she intended to tell him it was casual but didn't, that's a red flag. So, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't set clear expectations, leading to Justin's hurt. However, others might argue that her decision to leave for her own growth is valid. But the key is the lack of communication about the relationship's nature.\n"
