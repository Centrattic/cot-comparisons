We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man named Justin. They were in a relationship for over a year, and she moved in with him after losing her job. Justin provided her with financial support, including groceries and clothes. She didn't love him as much as he did, and when she got a good job, she broke up with him. Now, she feels bad but he's devastated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she did something wrong. The key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the breakup reasons. The age gap is 9 years, which isn't extremely large, but it's significant enough to note. She was in a financial struggle and Justin helped her out. However, she wasn't in love with him and broke up when she became more financially stable. \n\nEthically, relationships should be based on mutual feelings and not just convenience. The author might have taken advantage of Justin's financial help, but she wasn't aware of her feelings at the time. Breaking up when you no longer want the relationship isn't inherently wrong, especially if the relationship was unbalanced. However, considering Justin's Asperger's and his emotional state, maybe she should have handled the breakup more carefully. But the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her own happiness and independence.\n\nFinancial dependency can complicate relationships. If she relied on him for basic needs and then left when she no longer needed him, it might be seen as using him, but if the relationship was already casual and she wasn't in love, then it's about personal choice. The fact that she tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows she tried to ease the transition, though it backfired.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say she's being selfish, but others might argue she's prioritizing her own well-being. The key is whether there was a mutual understanding of the relationship's nature. If Justin believed it was more serious and she didn't, then she might be at fault for not being clear. However, the story doesn't mention her explicitly stating her intentions beyond initially considering it casual. \n\nUltimately, the decision to break up when one is no longer emotionally invested isn't necessarily wrong, but the circumstances of dependency and the sudden departure could be seen as contributing factors. But the main driver here is her moving on because she's not in love and has improved her financial situation. So the answer is likely B, she's not the asshole.\n"
