We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a better job is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They were dating for over a year, and she moved in with him after losing her job. She got a good job, saved money, and decided to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on Justin, moving in with him after her previous job ended. She mentions that she didn't love him as he did. When she got a better job, she felt more secure and decided to leave. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nIn relationships, mutual feelings and emotional investment matter. If she didn't feel the same level of love and was using the relationship for financial support, that's a red flag. However, once she became financially stable, she made a choice to end the relationship. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, especially if the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her. But the fact that she moved in with him and relied on him financially might make others question her intentions. However, she didn't lie about her feelings and broke up when she found her own stability, which could be seen as a responsible decision.\n\nConsidering Justin's age and Asperger's, he might have struggled with the breakup emotionally. But the woman's actions were based on her own needs and circumstances. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. The key here is whether she had a duty to stay in an unhappy relationship just because she was financially supported. Since the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she improved her situation, it's more about her right to pursue her own happiness. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
