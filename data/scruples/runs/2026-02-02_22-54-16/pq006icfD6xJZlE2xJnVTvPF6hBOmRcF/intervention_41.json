We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's 29, he's 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, was awkward but nice. They became a couple, he supported her financially, she moved in with him. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and now he's upset. She feels guilty but doesn't love him.\n\nSo, the question is about whether her decision was wrong. Legally and ethically, people have the right to end relationships if they feel it's not right for them. She didn't force the relationship; she was in it, but realized her feelings weren't reciprocal. The age difference might be a factor, but that's not necessarily a legal or moral issue. Financial dependency could be a point\u2014she relied on him financially when she was in a tough spot, but once she got a better job, she became more independent. Breaking up when one feels unloved isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she handled it might matter. She tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That suggests she tried to mitigate the hurt. \n\nBut some might argue she used him while she was in a vulnerable financial state, then left when her situation improved. But others would say people deserve to be in relationships where they feel loved and supported, and staying in an unequal or unreciprocated relationship isn't healthy. The fact that she didn't love him as much is a key point. She wasn't in the wrong for choosing to leave when she felt the relationship wasn't fulfilling. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
