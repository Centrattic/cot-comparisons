We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She mentions that she was in a low-income situation and took odd jobs, including cleaning. Justin, being in a more affluent area, started buying her things like groceries and a coat. She moved in with him after losing her job, relying on his financial support. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nThe key points here are the power dynamics and the reasons behind the breakup. The author was financially dependent on Justin initially, which might have created an imbalanced relationship. However, she later became financially stable with her new job. The breakup was because she didn't love him, not because of the job per se. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to end relationships if they're not feeling the same emotions. Justin's financial support might have made her feel dependent, but once she was stable, she chose to leave. The fact that she tried to comfort him shows some consideration. However, the age gap and the initial power imbalance (him being in a better financial position) could be points of criticism. But the main reason for the breakup was lack of love, not taking advantage of him. So, is she in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the relationship was built on genuine affection or dependency. Since she states she didn't love him, ending it makes sense. Hence, she's not the asshole.\n"
