We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a job is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29, the boyfriend is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's and was her meal ticket. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the main points here are the power dynamic. She was financially dependent on him when they were together. Then she got a better job, became more independent, and decided to leave. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship after gaining financial stability. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to be on equal footing. If one person is dependent on the other for their basic needs, that can create an imbalance. The woman might have realized that the relationship wasn't healthy because she wasn't in a good position financially. When she got a good job, she could make a different choice. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend had Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. He might have been more attached, but that doesn't mean she's wrong for ending it if she doesn't love him. \n\nBreaking up is tough, especially if the other person is hurt. But the decision to end the relationship came after she gained independence. It's possible she felt the relationship was holding her back once she had better opportunities. \n\nSo, considering all this, she might not be in the wrong. She had the right to make a choice that's best for her, especially when the situation changed. However, the way she handled the breakup could matter. Telling him they could still be friends with benefits might not be the best approach, but the core issue is about her decision to leave. \n\nOverall, I think the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong because she's choosing her own path once her circumstances changed.\n"
