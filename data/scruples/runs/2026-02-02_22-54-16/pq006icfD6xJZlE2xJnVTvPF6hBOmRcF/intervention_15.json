We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, 29, was in a relationship with Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was nice, she ended up moving in with him after losing her job and moving out of a poor apartment. He provided financial support, buying her clothes, groceries, etc. She didn't love him the way he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, she feels bad but moved out into a new apartment.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the age difference, the financial dynamics, and the emotional investment. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA). The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, the relationship started when she was cleaning his apartment. There's a power dynamic here where he was providing financial support because she was in a lower income situation. She mentions she was \"piss poor\" and moving in with him because her apartment was crumbling. So she was dependent on his support financially when they were together. Now she's moved on because she got a better job, which allowed her to become more financially stable. She broke up with him, which he took hard, but she didn't love him in the same way.\n\nIs she wrong for leaving? Well, relationships require mutual affection and commitment. If she didn't love him and was using his financial support, maybe that's an issue. But she doesn't say she was using him. She mentions she didn't love him the way he loved her. That's a common reason for breaking up. Also, when she got a better job, her circumstances changed, so maybe she felt it was time to move on. However, the fact that she was financially dependent on him when they were together might mean that the relationship wasn't entirely balanced. But once she became more financially stable, she might feel more empowered to leave.\n\nAnother angle: Justin is 20 and she's 29. There's a significant age gap. That could be a red flag on its own, especially if he's still in a phase where he's more emotionally immature. He has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional understanding. The author might not have been the right emotional match for him. She also tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, but he got angry. That might indicate he wasn't ready to move on, but that doesn't mean she's wrong for leaving.\n\nIs breaking up because of a better job a valid reason? If the relationship was already on shaky grounds because of lack of love, then yes. She's not breaking up for selfish material reasons, but because her life circumstances changed and she realized she wasn't in love. It's a mature decision to prioritize her own happiness and move on when the relationship isn't fulfilling. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that she used him financially while she was in a bad situation and then left when she improved. But she doesn't seem to have done that intentionally. She mentions she didn't lose her job, but had to take a lower paying one, so maybe she wasn't exploiting him. She was in a difficult situation when they were together, and when her situation improved, she chose to leave because she wasn't in love. That's a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nAlso, moving in with a much younger person who is providing financial support might have been a problematic dynamic from the start, especially with the age difference and her financial instability. Her decision to move out and into her own apartment is a step towards independence, which is positive.\n\nSo considering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong. She ended the relationship because she realized it wasn't based on mutual love and her circumstances changed. Breaking up to pursue a better life and personal growth isn't wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
