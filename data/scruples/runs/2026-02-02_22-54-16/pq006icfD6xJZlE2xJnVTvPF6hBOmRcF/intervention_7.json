We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the woman (let's call her Alice) is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a tough financial spot, working odd jobs including cleaning apartments. Justin lives in a luxury condo, which suggests a socioeconomic difference. They met when she was hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. They had a physical relationship, and Justin started buying her things, even helping her move in. She lost her original cleaning job and had to take a lower-paying one, so Justin was financially supporting her. However, she didn't love him as he loved her. Recently, she got a better-paying job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't. Let's think about relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel secure and not financially dependent in a way that could lead to instability. If Alice was relying on Justin for financial support and then left when she became more stable, is that her fault? Well, she didn't enter the relationship with the intention of staying indefinitely. She mentioned she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he took it more seriously. That might place some responsibility on Justin for assuming a more committed relationship than she intended. \n\nAlso, she broke up because she didn't love him, which is a valid reason. However, the timing might seem opportunistic from Justin's perspective. But considering their age difference and her financial situation, maybe she felt stuck in a cycle that Justin's support helped her escape. The fact that she tried to console him and offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows she cared, though it backfired. \n\nJustin's reaction is also important. His devastation and anger could stem from not being able to handle the breakup emotionally, especially given Asperger's potentially affecting his coping mechanisms. But that doesn't mean Alice is wrong for leaving. The question is about her responsibility. If she was clear about her intentions early on, maybe she's not at fault. But she didn't mention being upfront, which could be a point against her. However, the initial part says she was going to tell him it was casual before he became too attached. So maybe she was trying, but he didn't accept that. \n\nIn terms of ethics, leaving a relationship because you don't have feelings for the person is generally acceptable. Financial dependency can complicate things, but if she was in an emotionally healthy place and realized her feelings were only physical, then acting on that isn't wrong. She's improving her own situation, which is a positive step. However, the way she ended it might have been abrupt, but she did try to be kind. \n\nSo considering all factors, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because she left for personal reasons, not out of spite. Justin's reactions are more about his inability to handle the breakup rather than her wrongdoing. The financial dependency was on his side, and she's now in a better position. The age difference and his Asperger's might have played roles in his attachment, but that doesn't shift blame to her.\n"
