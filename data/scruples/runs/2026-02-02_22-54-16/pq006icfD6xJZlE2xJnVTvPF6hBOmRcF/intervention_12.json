We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman who broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a good job. They had been dating over a year, and she was dependent on him financially at times. Now she's saving money from her new job and moved out, but he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. He's 20, which is still quite young, and she's 29. There's a power imbalance here because she was financially dependent on him when she didn't have a job, and he was buying her things. Then she gets a better job, becomes financially stable, and breaks up. \n\nShe mentions not loving him as much as he does her. That's a red flag for being in a relationship where feelings aren't mutual. She was taking advantage of his emotional and financial support when she needed it. Once she's stable, she leaves. But is that wrong? Well, people can leave relationships when they feel it's not right. But there's also the aspect of whether she was honest about her feelings earlier.\n\nHe has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. He might have been more vulnerable, and she could have taken advantage of that. Did she ever express that she didn't love him before moving in with him? If she didn't, then leading him on could be an issue. But if she did and he still wanted to stay, maybe it's his choice.\n\nFinancial dependency is another point. If she relied on him for basic needs and then left, it's a form of emotional and maybe financial abandonment. But she's now in a better position, so she's not in the same situation. \n\nShe tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She did try to be considerate, but he's still upset. The question is whether breaking up for personal reasons is wrong. In some cases, people have to leave relationships that aren't healthy, even if it's painful for the other person. \n\nHowever, the ethical angle is tricky. If there's a significant age gap and financial exploitation, some might see it as the older person taking advantage. But she did move out and stop relying on him, which is positive. \n\nOverall, I think she's not in the wrong because she's choosing herself when she has the means now, even if it's painful. But some might argue she should have been more honest earlier. The key is whether she manipulated or led him on without honesty. If she was open about her feelings and the relationship was consensual, then it's her right to leave. So the answer is B.\n"
