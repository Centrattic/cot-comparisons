We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman in a one-year relationship with a 20-year-old man named Justin. She was in a lower income bracket and had odd jobs, including cleaning. She met Justin while cleaning his apartment, and he has Asperger's. They started a relationship, she moved in with him, and he supported her financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a better job, built savings, and broke up with him. He's now upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility. The woman didn't love him the way he loved her. That's a red flag. She was emotionally involved but not committed. Then she used his financial support to stabilize her situation. When she got a better job, she felt it was time to leave. Breaking up because of personal growth and financial stability isn't inherently wrong. However, the fact that she didn't love him as much might mean the relationship wasn't healthy to begin with. He was a teenager when they started, which could be an age gap issue. She moved in with him, which is a big step, but if she didn't have feelings for him, that's problematic. However, she broke up for her own reasons\u2014career and financial independence. That's a valid decision. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending an unbalanced relationship when she's made her own life better. Since she's choosing her own well-being and future, and the relationship wasn't based on mutual love, it's not her fault. So the answer is B.\n"
