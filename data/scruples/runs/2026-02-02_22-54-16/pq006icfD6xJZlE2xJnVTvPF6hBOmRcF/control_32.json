We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship between a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They were dating for over a year, and the woman broke up with him after getting a good job. The man was her financial support, and she moved in with him. She didn't love him but accepted his affection. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The age difference is 9 years. When the woman was with him, she was struggling financially, moving in with him, and he provided for her. Then she got a better job, became financially stable, and broke up. She tried to remain friends with benefits, but he was upset.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. Factors to consider: Was the relationship based on mutual affection or convenience? She admitted she didn't love him, but he cared deeply. She moved in with him, implying some commitment. Breaking up because of personal success could be seen as selfish if he was emotionally dependent. However, she was in a difficult financial situation before and now is better off. Maybe she had the right to pursue her career and independence. But ending the relationship might have left him emotionally hurt, especially with Asperger's which can affect emotional processing. \n\nIs it fair to break up for personal advancement? Maybe, but the timing and communication matter. She did break up and tried to console him. He had a right to be upset, but she's not necessarily wrong for pursuing her life. However, if she knew he had strong feelings and ended it abruptly, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she moved in together suggests a more serious commitment than just a casual relationship. If she was using him for financial support and then left, that's a problem. But she did accept his support and later left when she could be independent. \n\nIn conclusion, while she has the right to her career, the emotional impact on him is significant. However, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own life. The key is whether the breakup was handled with respect. She tried to console him, but maybe didn't give enough time for adjustment. Still, the decision itself isn't unethical.\n"
