We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a better job is the asshole. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, their relationship started when the author was working odd jobs, including cleaning. The boyfriend, Justin, is 20, has Asperger's, and they met when she was cleaning his apartment. She mentions moving in with him because her apartment was bad. Justin provided support like buying groceries and clothes, and she lost her cleaning job, making her reliant on him financially. She doesn't love him but he's in love with her. Then she gets a good job, saves money, and breaks up with him. He's devastated, and she feels bad.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on Justin, who is younger and has a condition that might affect his understanding of relationships. She moved in with him out of necessity. When she gets a better job, she becomes more stable and ends the relationship. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nIn relationships, mutual feelings and commitment are important. The author didn't love him but stayed, possibly because of financial need. When her situation improved, she ended it. While it's her right to leave a relationship she's not in love with, the way she handled it might matter. She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. However, the fact that she was using him for support and then leaving when she no longer needed it could be seen as selfish. But she's also in her right to pursue her own stability and happiness. The key points are consent, mutual understanding, and how the breakup was handled. Since the author didn't force the relationship but ended it when her circumstances changed, it's more about personal growth. Still, the emotional impact on Justin, who's vulnerable, might weigh on the decision. But overall, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's acting in her own best interest once she's stable. So the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). However, some might argue that she should have addressed the relationship's issues before leaving, but given the context, it's a valid choice.\n"
