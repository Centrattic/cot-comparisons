We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. \n\nFirst, the relationship details: the author is 29, her ex Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, who has Asperger's, started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She mentions it was kind of a meal ticket situation. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on Justin for a period, then became more stable. She broke up because she felt unfulfilled, not in love. Justin was emotionally attached, maybe even codependent. The question is whether she's in the wrong for leaving when she's now more independent.\n\nLooking at the factors: Age difference is significant (20 vs. 29). The power dynamic here is important. Justin being 20 and her being 29 might mean she was in a position of responsibility or guidance. But she says she didn't love him. Relationships require mutual affection, so if she didn't love him, that's a valid reason to end it. However, Justin's Asperger's might make it harder for him to understand the breakup, but that doesn't make her right or wrong.\n\nShe did try to console him and even suggest a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She also moved out, which is her right. The fact that she broke up when she was more financially stable could imply that her previous dependency might have complicated the relationship, but leaving when she's better off isn't unethical. \n\nThe main issue is whether leaving a relationship where you were previously dependent is the right choice. Since she's choosing herself and her independence, that's generally seen as positive. However, the age gap and power dynamics might mean she had a responsibility to handle the breakup with more care. But Justin's reaction is his own to deal with, and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's unhappy in.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). People have the right to leave relationships that don't meet their emotional needs, even if they were in a dependent position before. The fact that she's now more stable gives her the agency to make this choice without being the asshole.\n"
