We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is 29, their ex is Justin, 20 years old. They dated over a year. The user was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning. They met Justin through his cleaning job, and he bought them things like groceries and a coat. They moved in together. Then the user lost their job at the cleaning company and got a lower-paying one, so Justin was their \"meal ticket\" as they put it. The user didn't love Justin like he loved them. Then the user got a good job, saved money, broke up with Justin. Justin is devastated, the user tried to console him but he's not okay with friends with benefits. The user moved out and feels bad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, the user's lack of love, and the breakup after getting a stable job.\n\nAge difference: 20 vs. 29 is a 9-year gap. Not unheard of, but sometimes there can be issues with maturity levels. The user is more experienced, Justin is younger, which might affect the relationship dynamics.\n\nFinancial aspect: The user was in a low-income situation and Justin provided financial support. The user moving in with him because their apartment was crumbling. Then the user got a good job, became financially stable, and broke up. The user might feel they were relying on Justin financially, but after getting their own financial footing, they ended the relationship. That could be seen as the user making a choice based on their own needs once they were secure.\n\nEmotional aspect: The user says they don't love Justin like he does. Justin, on the other hand, seems to have deeper feelings. The user didn't start the relationship intending to be casual but then changed their mind. The breakup happened when the user had their own financial stability, so maybe they felt they no longer needed the relationship, which Justin was emotionally invested in.\n\nPossible angles: Some might argue that the user was using Justin financially, especially since they moved in and relied on him after losing a job. However, the user also says they didn't love him and were emotionally distant. Breaking up when they can take care of themselves might be seen as responsible. Others might say that the user led Justin on, making him believe there was a future when the user wasn't committed, which is unfair to Justin.\n\nThe user tried to offer friendship after the breakup, but Justin was upset. The user's actions could be seen as self-serving, but given their financial situation, maybe they were just looking out for their own needs. The question is whether the user had the right to end the relationship when they did, especially considering Justin's feelings and the fact that they were younger and possibly more vulnerable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships require mutual consent and understanding. If the user never intended to commit and only stayed because of financial reasons, that's a problem. However, once they became financially independent, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong, especially if there was no mutual agreement on the relationship's future. The user's honesty about not loving Justin might mitigate some blame, but the way the breakup was handled could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer isn't clear-cut. But the user's main reason for staying was financial, and once that changed, they ended it. Since they were honest about their feelings and took action when they could support themselves, it's more about personal choice and responsibility. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
