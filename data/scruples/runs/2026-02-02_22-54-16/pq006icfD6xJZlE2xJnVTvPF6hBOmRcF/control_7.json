We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning apartments where she met Justin. He lives in a luxury condo nearby. She mentions they started a sexual relationship, and Justin gave her things like groceries, a coat, and even helped her move in. She moved in with him after losing her job, relying on his financial support. She didn't love him as much as he did and, when she got a better-paying job, she broke up with him. Now she's feeling bad about it.\n\nFirst, the age difference. Justin is 10 years younger. While that's not illegal, there could be power dynamics here. She's an adult, and he's a minor if he's 20 (depending on the country, but assuming the US where 21 is the legal age), but maybe he's just a young adult. He has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships and consent. She mentions he was awkward at first but sweet. She took his virginity and started a relationship. Was that consensual? The question is whether she exploited his vulnerability.\n\nShe also moved in with him after losing her job, using him as a financial support. She admits she didn't love him as much as he loved her. That could indicate a lack of emotional commitment. When she got a good job, she broke up, leading to his devastation. She tried to console him, offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She's now wondering if she was wrong.\n\nKey points: Did she take advantage of Justin's financial situation and vulnerability (Asperger's, being young)? Was the relationship unequal in terms of power and emotional investment? She used his resources to move in with him, then left when she became financially stable. Could this be seen as exploiting him?\n\nBut she does mention that Justin was buying her things, which might be his own choice. Also, she didn't force the relationship; he was the one who was buying her stuff. However, when one person is in a vulnerable position and the other is using their resources, there might be an imbalance. Also, her breaking up after improving her own situation could be seen as self-serving, but not necessarily wrong if the relationship was never based on mutual love.\n\nThe question is about whether she is in the wrong. If she was aware of his feelings and didn't reciprocate, but stayed in the relationship while using his financial support, that might be ethically questionable. But she did try to console him and offered friendship. Still, breaking up might be her right, but exploiting someone's resources while not having the same emotional investment could make her the asshole.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of her improving her life. Maybe she deserves the better job and financial stability. However, the way she handled the breakup and the power dynamics are issues. The answer might depend on whether her actions were manipulative or if she was honest about her feelings from the start. She says she didn't tell him it was strictly casual even though she knew he liked her. That could be a problem. She should have been upfront if she wasn't interested in a committed relationship. Also, moving in with him while not loving him might be using him. So overall, she might be in the wrong because of the imbalance and not being honest about her feelings.\n"
