We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a better job is in the wrong. The scenario is that she was in a relationship with Justin, who's 20 and has Asperger's. She was in a financial situation where she needed odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They started a relationship, and he provided financial support. She moved in with him after losing her job. Now, she got a better-paying job, saved money, and decided to break up. Justin is upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. There's a significant age gap, which might affect the maturity levels and expectations. Justin is described as being on the autism spectrum, which can influence how he processes emotions and relationships. The user mentions that she didn't love him as he did, which is a classic case of an imbalanced relationship. \n\nThe financial aspect is crucial here. The user was in a poor situation and relied on Justin for groceries and other needs. When she got a better job, her financial independence likely changed the dynamic. It's not uncommon for relationships to become complicated when there's a shift in financial stability. The user might have felt that staying in the relationship wasn't right if she wasn't in love and if the financial support was a key factor in their connection.\n\nJustin's reaction is another point to consider. He's devastated, and he might be struggling with the emotional impact of the breakup. However, the user tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. His anger at that suggestion shows he might not be emotionally ready to move on, but it's not necessarily the user's fault. \n\nThe question of whether she's in the wrong hinges on intentions and communication. If she genuinely didn't have feelings for him and felt the relationship wasn't sustainable, ending it to pursue her independence isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to prioritize their well-being and growth. However, the way the breakup was handled, especially if Justin felt used or if there was a lack of clear communication about the relationship's future, could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the power imbalance. If she relied on Justin financially and then decided to leave when she became more stable, some might argue she was using him. But if the relationship was based on mutual benefits without genuine emotional investment from her side, it's not exploitation but a realization that the relationship wasn't meeting her emotional needs. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user may feel guilty, the decision to end a relationship where there's a lack of mutual affection and where financial circumstances change is a personal choice. The key factors are the lack of love on her part and the shift in her financial situation, which allowed her to make a more autonomous decision. Therefore, she's likely not in the wrong.\n"
