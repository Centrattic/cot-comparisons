We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The key points here are the age difference, their relationship dynamics, and her reasons for breaking up.\n\nFirst, she's 29 and he's 20, which is a nine-year gap. That might not be a huge deal, but it could influence their maturity levels and life goals. She was in a lower income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. She mentions he was her \"meal ticket\" since he provided financial support after she lost her job. She then gets a better-paying job, gains financial independence, and decides to break up. \n\nShe didn't love him as much as he loved her, so she ended the relationship. He's upset, and she feels bad but moved on. The question is whether she's the asshole here. \n\nOn one hand, she's taking control of her life, becoming financially stable, and ending a relationship where she wasn't in love. On the other hand, he was younger, had a condition that might affect emotional processing, and she might have taken advantage of his generosity. But she didn't force the relationship; he was the one who was investing more emotionally. \n\nHer breaking up after gaining independence isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she handled it might matter. She tried to console him but he was still upset. The fact that she moved in with him and relied on his financial support while not reciprocating love could be a point against her. But in the end, she's choosing her own well-being, which is important. \n\nThe key here is whether she had a valid reason to end the relationship. Since she wasn't in love and was becoming independent, it's more about her right to make that choice. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
