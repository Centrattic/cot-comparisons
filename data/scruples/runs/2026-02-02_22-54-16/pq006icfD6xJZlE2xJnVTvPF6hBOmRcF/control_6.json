We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend, Justin, after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 29, and Justin is 20. They've been dating over a year. She was in a lower income situation, doing odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's and was awkward but sweet. They became a couple, she moved in with him after losing her job and moving out of a crumbling apartment. Justin provided financial support\u2014groceries, clothes, a coat. But she didn't love him the way he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's devastated, and she feels bad but moved out into a new apartment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she did the wrong thing by ending the relationship once she became more financially stable. The key points here are consent, mutual feelings, and the reasons behind the breakup. She mentions she didn't love him like he loved her. That's a common reason for breaking up. Also, the financial dependency shifts\u2014when she was in a worse financial situation, Justin supported her, but now she's better off and chose to end the relationship. \n\nBut does that make her the asshole? Let's think. Justin moved her in, provided support, but she felt the relationship was unbalanced emotionally. She was honest about not loving him as he did. The breakup was mutual in the sense that she's moving on, but he's struggling with it. The question is about her responsibility. \n\nFinancial support doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is transactional unless both parties are okay with it. The author seems to have been upfront about her feelings. She tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. She moved out, which is her right. \n\nThe age difference might also play a role. Justin is 20, so maybe he's more emotionally immature. But she's 29, and it's her prerogative to end the relationship if she's not in love. The fact that she didn't love him is a legitimate reason. \n\nAlso, she mentions she was going to tell him it's strictly casual but he started to like her. So maybe there was a misunderstanding. But once she realized she didn't love him, it's better to break up than stay. The fact that she's now in a better job and can support herself is a positive change. \n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. She's making a decision based on her feelings and circumstances. The answer would be B (No, she's not the asshole). Justin's devastation is unfortunate, but she's not obligated to stay in an unrequited relationship.\n"
