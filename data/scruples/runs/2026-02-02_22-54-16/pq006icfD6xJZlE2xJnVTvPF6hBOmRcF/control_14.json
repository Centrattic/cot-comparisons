We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the woman breaks up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, their age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a nine-year gap. But age alone doesn't make it wrong. Then, she was in a lower-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He lives in a luxury condo, so there's a socioeconomic difference. They met through her job, and he had Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships.\n\nShe mentions they had a casual start, but he got attached, bought her things, and she moved in with him. She says she didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she feels bad, wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. She broke up because she had a new job and financial stability. But was the relationship built on a solid foundation? She didn't love him, but he was providing financial support. When she left, it's possible he felt abandoned. However, she was moving up in her career, which is positive. \n\nIs it right to end a relationship when you're not in love? If the relationship wasn't based on mutual love but more on his financial support and her convenience, then maybe she's justified. But he might have had feelings invested, and she might have led him on. However, she tried to be kind after the breakup, suggesting she cares about his feelings.\n\nAlso, moving in together when there's an imbalance in commitment (she wasn't in love) might have been a mistake. But she's taking steps to better her life. The question is whether her decision was wrong. Breaking up because you realize you don't love someone isn't wrong, regardless of timing or job changes. However, if the breakup was solely about financial independence and not addressing the emotional issues, maybe there's a problem.\n\nBut considering she didn't love him, and he was emotionally dependent, her decision to leave when she could support herself might be seen as responsible. The fact that she tried to console him and offered friendship shows she isn't cruel. The answer might hinge on whether the relationship was healthy. If it was unequal, then she's not the asshole. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong). But need to check for any cultural or ethical nuances. In some views, leaving when things get better might be seen as selfish, but emotionally, if there's no love, it's a valid choice.\n"
