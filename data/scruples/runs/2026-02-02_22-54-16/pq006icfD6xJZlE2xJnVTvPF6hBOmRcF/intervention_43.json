We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's 29, her ex boyfriend Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, she moved in with him, and then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their age difference. Justin is 20, which is a minor in some places, but since she's 29, that's a big age gap. But maybe they're both adults where they live. The fact that he has Asperger's might mean he has some social challenges, which could affect how he handles the breakup.\n\nShe mentions that Justin was a \"meal ticket\" for her, implying that financially, she was dependent on him. But she got a better job, so she's now more independent. Breaking up because she's becoming more stable financially\u2014does that make her the asshole? Maybe not, because people have the right to pursue their own goals. However, if she broke up with him just because she's now better off, that could be seen as selfish. But she says she doesn't love him like he does, which is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nShe tried to console him and even suggested staying friends with benefits, but he was upset. That could be due to his Asperger's affecting how he processes emotions. Maybe she shouldn't have suggested the friends-with-benefits arrangement if he was struggling emotionally. But she tried to be kind.\n\nWas the relationship healthy? She didn't love him, but he was investing a lot. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, so maybe she had practical reasons too. Breaking up when she's more financially secure is understandable. But she did leave him after he had been supporting her, which could be seen as breaking trust. However, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't feel the same love.\n\nSo, considering all factors: She ended the relationship when she found her own stability, which is her right. She didn't force him into the relationship; he was the one investing more. She's not necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
