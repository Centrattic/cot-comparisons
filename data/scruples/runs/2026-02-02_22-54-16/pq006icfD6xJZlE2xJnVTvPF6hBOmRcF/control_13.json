We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's 29, in a relationship with Justin, who's 20 and has Asperger's. They've been dating over a year. She was working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, they moved in together, and she lost her job and relied on him financially. She didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she feels bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. She's in a relationship where she was financially dependent on him at some point, but then she got a better job and became more stable. She broke up because she didn't love him, and he's upset. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, she's choosing her independence and financial stability. She wasn't in love, so ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. People can't force themselves into relationships without love. Also, moving in together and financial dependency can be tricky, especially if the relationship isn't reciprocal. She might have realized that the relationship wasn't healthy or fulfilling long-term.\n\nOn the other hand, Justin might have been investing more emotionally and financially. If he was giving her things because he loved her, and she was using him as a meal ticket, then breaking up after becoming financially stable could be seen as leaving when he's vulnerable. But she did try to be helpful, like suggesting friendship or a friends-with-benefits, which he rejected. Also, age difference and maturity levels might play a role\u2014Justin being 20 and her 29 could mean different life stages and expectations.\n\nBut overall, people have the right to end relationships if they're not fulfilled. The fact that she left when she found her feet financially isn't inherently wrong. She wasn't in love, and relationships should be based on mutual affection. Justin's reaction is sad, but she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's not happy in. So I think the answer is B, she's not the asshole.\n"
