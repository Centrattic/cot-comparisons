We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see... They're 29, their boyfriend Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They were dating over a year. She was taking odd jobs, cleaning apartments. Met Justin when she cleaned his apartment, then they started a relationship. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. Lost her job, so Justin supported her financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Got a good job, saved money, then broke up. Now Justin is devastated, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the age difference. 20 vs 29\u2014that's a 9-year gap. Depending on the context, but in some places, 20 is still young adulthood. The relationship might be seen as a older person in a relationship with someone younger. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for breaking up after getting a job.\n\nShe broke up after securing a better job. She had been relying on him financially when she was between jobs. Now that she has a better job and savings, she moves out. But she felt she didn't love him like he did. Is it wrong to end a relationship because you don't love someone enough?\n\nThe user mentions that Justin started to like her a lot, bought her things, and she moved in with him. But she didn't return the love. So she ended it when she had financial stability again. The question is whether breaking up for that reason is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, if one person isn't feeling the same level of love, it's often a valid reason to end things. Justin might have been emotionally invested, but the author felt the relationship wasn't reciprocal. Also, the power dynamic with financial dependence could be an issue. When she was financially reliant on him, maybe the relationship was imbalanced. Now that she's stable, ending it could be seen as her prioritizing her own needs and independence. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have addressed the lack of love earlier instead of waiting until she had a job. Also, the fact that Justin is younger and has Aspergers could mean he's more vulnerable. However, the decision to end a relationship isn't typically considered wrong if the person is honest about their feelings. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. She made a choice based on her feelings and newfound independence. But some might say she could have handled the breakup earlier or more sensitively. However, the act of breaking up because of not loving someone isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
