We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong, and they want a simple A or B answer. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, the person (the author) is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was struggling financially, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. Justin lives in a luxury condo because of gentrification, which makes their economic situations different. They met when she was cleaning his place. Justin has Asperger's, was initially awkward but became a sweetheart. She took his virginity, and they started a relationship. Justin bought her groceries, clothes, a nice coat, and she moved in with him because her apartment was bad. She lost her cleaning job and got a lower-paying one, so Justin was her main support. But she didn't love him the same way. Then she got a better job, saved up, and broke up with him a week ago. Now he's devastated, she tried to comfort him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which made him angry. She moved out but feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are the financial dependency, the difference in their life situations, and the emotional aspects. The author was in a tough spot financially, relying on Justin's support. But she didn't love him the same way. When she got a better job and became more stable, she decided to leave. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships should be based on mutual feelings. If she didn't love Justin and was only staying because of his financial help, that's not a healthy situation. Breaking up when she's more stable might be seen as responsible. However, the fact that she took advantage of his generosity and then left could be a problem. Also, Justin's age and his Asperger's might affect his emotional processing. \n\nBut the user says she's not in the wrong. Maybe because she's prioritizing her own well-being and financial security. People have the right to leave relationships where the feelings aren't mutual. The friends-with-benefits offer might have been a mistake, but the breakup itself isn't necessarily the issue. The fact that she was honest about her feelings and took the decision when she found a better job could be seen as justifiable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she led him on, especially if he believed their relationship was more than just casual. If she didn't clarify her intentions and instead relied on his emotional investment, that could be seen as manipulative. But the author mentioned she intended to tell him it was strictly casual, but he started to like her. So maybe that's part of the problem. Even if she didn't love him, she might have given him hope. \n\nHowever, the main point is that she made the decision when her circumstances changed, and she was honest about it. While it's painful for Justin, the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship where her feelings aren't mutual. So overall, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. But there's nuance. She could have handled the breakup with more empathy, but the decision itself is valid.\n"
