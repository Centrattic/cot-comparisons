We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, who is 29, was dating Justin, a 20-year-old with Asperger's. They started a relationship after she cleaned his apartment. Justin was buying her things, and she moved in with him. She mentions that she didn't love him the way he loved her, but she was using him as a meal ticket because she was in a low-paying job. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up with him. Now she's feeling bad about it.\n\nFirst, Justin was 20 when they started dating. That's a significant age difference. Depending on the location, there might be legal concerns if the author is much older. But the user didn't mention any legal issues, so maybe that's not the core here.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where she admitted she didn't love him as he loved her. That's a red flag. She used him for financial support, moving in with him because her apartment was bad. Then she left when she got a better job. She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual feelings. She started a relationship with someone she didn't love, used him financially, and then ended it when her circumstances changed. While she had the right to change her mind, the way the relationship was formed might be questionable. If she knew she wasn't in love from the start but continued the relationship anyway, that's being inconsiderate. Justin relied on her for support, and she left when she could support herself, which might be seen as self-serving.\n\nHowever, she did break up and tried to be kind. The question is whether she's the asshole. The community often looks at intentions and harm. She might not be the asshole if she's honest about her feelings, but if she led him on knowing she wasn't interested in a real relationship, that's different. The fact that she didn't love him but continued the relationship suggests she was in the wrong. Also, the age gap might be a factor in how the situation is perceived, especially if there was a power imbalance due to her being more experienced and him being younger.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because she entered into a relationship without mutual love, used the other person for support, and ended it when it suited her, which could be seen as manipulative or selfish despite her reasons.\n"
