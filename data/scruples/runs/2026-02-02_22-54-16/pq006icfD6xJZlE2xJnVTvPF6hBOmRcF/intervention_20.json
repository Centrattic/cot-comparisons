We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's 29, dating Justin who's 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, they moved in together, and she was working a lower-paying job. Then she got a better job, saved up money, and broke up with him. Now he's upset and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the dynamics of their relationship. Justin is significantly younger, which can sometimes lead to power imbalances. She mentions that she moved in with him because her apartment was crumbling, and he was buying her groceries and clothes. That seems like he was financially supporting her. When she got a better job, she became more financially stable. She decided to break up, which he took hard. She tried to console him and even offered to be friends with benefits, but he was angry.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. Did she act in bad faith? She says she didn't love him like he did, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. People have different emotional commitments, and it's okay to not be in love. But did she take advantage of him? She was in a situation where she was financially dependent on him, which might have been an issue. However, once she got a better job, the dynamic changed. Breaking up when her circumstances improved makes sense for her, but she should have communicated her feelings earlier. Ending a relationship isn't always about being right or wrong, but about personal needs and circumstances. \n\nHowever, Justin's age and Asperger's might mean he has different social or emotional processing. If she didn't clearly communicate her feelings before moving in together, maybe that's where the issue lies. But she did mention that she intended to make it casual but he took it further. She ended it when her life improved, which is her choice. So overall, she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own needs and circumstances. The answer is B.\n"
