We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age difference, with the author being 29 and Justin 20. They had been dating over a year. The author was in a financial struggle and working odd jobs, including cleaning. She met Justin, who lived in a luxury condo, while working for him. They started a relationship, and Justin became her financial support after she lost her job. The author didn't love him but stayed, and when she got a better job, she broke up with him. Justin is upset, and she feels bad but moved out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she was in a relationship where both parties were emotionally invested. The author mentions she didn't love Justin like he did, which suggests the relationship might not have been balanced. Justin was buying her things and supporting her financially, which could indicate he was more committed. The author moved in with him but didn't reciprocate the emotional commitment.\n\nThe key point is whether breaking up over personal betterment is justifiable. The author got a job that improved her financial situation, allowing her to be independent. Leaving a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested could be seen as self-improvement rather than a betrayal. However, breaking up because of financial stability might be viewed as using Justin, especially if he was emotionally invested and she wasn't.\n\nAnother angle is that the author was in a vulnerable situation financially and relied on Justin, which might complicate the relationship's power dynamics. When she became financially stable, she chose to leave, which could be seen as prioritizing her own well-being. But Justin's age (20) and Asperger's might make him more emotionally dependent, and breaking up could be harsh on him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. If she was honest about her feelings and didn't deceive him, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she led him on or didn't communicate her lack of commitment, that could make her at fault. The author did mention she didn't love him, so she might have been truthful, but the timing of the breakup when he was so dependent on her might be a point against her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a choice based on her own betterment, but the way she handled the breakup and the emotional impact on Justin could be debated. However, since she didn't force him into the relationship and the breakup was after she improved her situation, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
