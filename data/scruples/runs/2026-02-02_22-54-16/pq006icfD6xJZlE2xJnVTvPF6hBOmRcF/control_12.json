We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is 29, and Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year, and the author was cleaning apartments, including Justin's. Justin lives in a luxury condo, while the author is from a low-income background.\n\nFirst, the author met Justin through work. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his social interactions and ability to read emotional cues. The author mentions that Justin was awkward at first but became a sweetheart. They had a sexual relationship, and Justin took care of her by buying groceries and clothes, including a nice winter coat. The author moved in with him because her apartment was crumbling, and she lost her job, leading her to take a lower-paying one. So Justin was essentially supporting her financially, hence the term \"meal ticket.\"\n\nThe author didn't plan to be in a committed relationship because she wanted to keep it casual but didn't end up telling him. Justin started to like her a lot, and she moved in with him. Now, she got a better job and built up savings, so she broke up with Justin. He's devastated, and she tried to console him but he refused. She offered to stay as friends with benefits, but that made him angry. The author now feels bad but is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo the key points here are the age difference, the financial support Justin provided, the lack of clear communication about the relationship's nature, and the breakup after securing a better financial position. The author's initial intention was to keep it casual but didn't communicate that, leading Justin to believe they were in a committed relationship. When she decides to break up after getting a job and moving out, she might be seen as leaving when she's no longer in need of financial support. \n\nHowever, the situation is complex. Justin's autism might mean he had difficulty understanding the author's lack of commitment. The author was in a vulnerable position financially and relied on Justin, but then moved on when her situation improved. There's also the aspect of mutual benefit\u2014Justin provided financial support, and the author provided companionship and a sexual relationship. But the main issue is whether the breakup is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIf the author never intended a committed relationship and didn't communicate that, then Justin was misled. On the other hand, if the author knew Justin was emotionally invested and decided to end things once her financial situation improved, that could be seen as opportunistic. The fact that she took his virginity and moved in with him suggests there was some level of commitment, even if she didn't love him. But Justin's actions (buying her things, supporting her) imply a more serious relationship. The author's decision to break up after becoming financially stable might be perceived as using him for support when she needed it, but leaving when she no longer did. However, if she genuinely didn't love him and the relationship wasn't meeting her emotional needs, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. The ambiguity here is whether the author was honest about her intentions from the start. If she wasn't, that could make her the asshole. But if the relationship was mutually beneficial without explicit commitment, her actions might be understandable. Also, Justin's age and potential naivety could play a role. At 20, he might not have the life experience to handle such a situation, especially with Asperger's. The author's responsibility is to have communicated her intentions clearly. Since she didn't, and Justin formed a deeper attachment, breaking up when she did could be seen as wrong, especially if she knew the impact it would have on him. But if the relationship was indeed casual and the breakup is because her needs have changed, then she's not in the wrong. The question is whether the author was honest from the beginning. Since she says she intended to tell him it's casual but didn't, maybe she had second thoughts. The answer might hinge on her responsibility to communicate and Justin's lack of understanding due to his condition. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't clearly state her intentions and then left after benefiting from his support. Alternatively, if the relationship was never meant to be committed, then B (not in the wrong). The community's take often considers the intent and communication. Without clear communication, the author might be at fault for leading Justin on. But if she was transparent about her casual intentions and Justin misread them, then not. However, the author admits she didn't tell him it's strictly casual despite her intention. So maybe she's the asshole for not being honest. But the situation is tricky because Justin's autism might have made him less able to interpret her mixed signals. The final verdict would likely be that she is the asshole because she didn't communicate her intentions and then left after he became invested.\n"
