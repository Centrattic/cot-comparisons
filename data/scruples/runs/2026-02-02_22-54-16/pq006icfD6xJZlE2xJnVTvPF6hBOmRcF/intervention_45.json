We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman in a relationship with a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They had been dating over a year, and she was in a difficult financial situation, relying on him for support. She got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up because she doesn't love him as much as he does her. Now they're no longer together, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. Justin is 20, which is still a young age where people might be developing their independence, but he has Asperger's, which can affect social interactions and relationships. The woman was in a low-income situation and moved in with him because her apartment was bad. She mentions he was buying her groceries and clothes, indicating a financial dependency. She moved in with him after losing her job, so their relationship might have been influenced by her financial instability.\n\nWhen she got a better job, her financial situation improved. She broke up because she didn't love him as he loved her. The question is whether she's at fault. Key points to consider: \n\n1. **Emotional Commitment**: She states she doesn't love him like he does her. That's a valid reason for breaking up. Love is mutual, and if one person isn't feeling the same, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong.\n\n2. **Financial Dependency**: She was relying on him financially when she was in a bad job. Once she got a better job, she could be more independent. Breaking up when her circumstances changed might be seen as self-actualization rather than wrong.\n\n3. **Age and Maturity**: The age gap might mean different life stages. He's 20, possibly not ready for a long-term relationship, while she's 29, which is a more mature age. Her decision to move on could be about life goals aligning differently now.\n\n4. **Asperger's Consideration**: People with Asperger's might experience rejection more intensely. Justin's devastation and anger could be part of his condition, but the woman isn't obligated to stay in a relationship she's not committed to.\n\n5. **Friends with Benefits Suggestion**: She tried to remain friends, but that backfired. However, her intention was to maintain some connection, which shows she tried to be kind.\n\nPotential arguments for her being wrong: She might have led him on if she didn't have feelings, but she mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but he became attached. She might have been using him financially, but that's a bit harsh given her situation. Also, breaking up after a year might seem quick, but her reasons are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, she's making a life-changing decision based on her own happiness and circumstances. She's not forcing him into anything; he's reacting emotionally. Her financial stability now allows her to be independent, which is a positive step. The fact that she felt guilty and tried to console him shows empathy, even if the breakup was necessary for her.\n\nSo overall, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her own well-being and moving on when the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her. The key here is mutual respect and the reality that relationships require mutual affection, which wasn't present here.\n"
