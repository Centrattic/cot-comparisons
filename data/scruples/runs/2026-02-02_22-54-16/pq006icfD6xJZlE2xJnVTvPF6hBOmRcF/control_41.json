We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, the background: The author, a 29-year-old woman, was dating a 20-year-old named Justin. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's and was initially awkward but became a sweet partner. He supported her financially when she was jobless, even buying her clothes and a coat. She moved in with him. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's devastated, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the sudden breakup after becoming more financially stable. Let's consider each angle.\n\nAge gap: 9 years isn't huge, but Justin is significantly younger. The user is 29, and he's 20. That could affect their relationship dynamics, especially if there's a maturity gap. However, age alone doesn't determine right or wrong.\n\nFinancial dependency: The user mentions that Justin was her \"meal ticket\" when she was jobless. This raises questions about whether their relationship was built on genuine emotional connection or if there was an imbalance in support. If she relied heavily on him financially and then left when she became stable, some might see it as self-serving. But she also helped him by moving in with him and taking care of her own needs when she could.\n\nEmotional connection: She states she doesn't love him as he does. If there's a lack of mutual affection, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she ended it matters. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That might show she considered his feelings, but maybe not enough.\n\nTiming of the breakup: She left after securing a better job. People often make life decisions based on personal circumstances. If she felt the relationship wasn't sustainable long-term, especially with the age difference and her own financial stability now, it's a personal choice. However, leaving because she's more stable might look like she's prioritizing her own needs over his, which could be seen as selfish by some.\n\nJustin's reaction: He's devastated, which is understandable given his young age and Asperger's, possibly affecting how he processes relationships. But does that make her wrong? Not necessarily. People in relationships should be able to handle breakups, even if it's painful.\n\nThe friends-with-benefits suggestion might have been a mistake. Offering to continue a sexual relationship without emotional commitment could be confusing for someone with Asperger's, who might struggle with emotional nuances. That could have contributed to his anger and hurt feelings.\n\nEthically, relationships require mutual effort and emotional investment. If the author felt there was no love on her part, ending the relationship is her right. However, if Justin was emotionally invested and she knew that, leaving him when her circumstances improved could be seen as taking advantage of his dependency. But she didn't force him to support her; they moved in together voluntarily.\n\nIn summary, while there might be valid reasons for her decision, the way she handled the breakup and the financial dependency could influence whether she's at fault. The key is whether she acted in bad faith. If she genuinely didn't have feelings for him and made a decision based on her life circumstances, she's not in the wrong. However, if she used the job as an excuse to leave without considering his emotional state, then maybe. But given the information, her actions seem more about personal growth and recognizing the relationship wasn't right for her.\n"
