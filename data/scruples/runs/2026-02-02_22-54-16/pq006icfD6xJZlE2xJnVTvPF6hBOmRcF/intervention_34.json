We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to understand the situation better.\n\nSo, the person, let's call her Alice, is 29 and her boyfriend Justin is 20. They dated for over a year. Alice was struggling financially, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin is described as having Aspergers and being awkward but sweet. They had a physical relationship, and Justin started buying her things like groceries and a coat. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. She lost her cleaning job and Justin was her main support. She didn't love him as much as he did, but recently got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now Justin is devastated, and she feels bad but moved out. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points here. Alice was in a difficult financial situation, relying on Justin for support. They had a relationship that was initiated when Alice was cleaning his apartment. Justin's actions, buying her things, moving in with him, suggest he was committed to her. However, Alice didn't love him the same way. She got a better job, became more independent, and decided to end the relationship. The breakup caused Justin emotional distress.\n\nNow, the user thinks Alice isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The user's answer is B (No). I need to evaluate if Alice made the right decision. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships should be based on mutual feelings. If Alice didn't love Justin, staying in the relationship might not be ethical. Justin's emotional state isn't her responsibility once the relationship ends. Also, the age difference is significant (29 vs 20), which might affect the dynamics. However, some might argue that leaving someone who provided support could be seen as selfish, especially if Justin had a disability like Aspergers, which might make it harder for him to handle emotional changes.\n\nBut considering that Alice was in a position of needing financial stability and found a way to improve her situation, her decision to leave when she felt it was right is her prerogative. The fact that she tried to console Justin by suggesting friendship might not be the best approach, but the breakup itself is her decision. The main issue is whether she's obligated to stay in a relationship she's not emotionally committed to. Since she didn't force Justin into the relationship and the breakup wasn't malicious, it's more about personal choice. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
