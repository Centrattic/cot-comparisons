We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. I need to analyze the context carefully.\n\nFirst, the woman (let's call her AITA) is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin because he hired her to clean his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which he managed to be awkward but sweet. They had a physical relationship, and she ended up moving in with him after losing her job. Justin provided her with financial support through groceries, clothes, and a nicer living situation. However, she didn't love him the way he loved her. She got a better-paying job, saved money, then broke up with him. Justin is devastated, and she feels bad about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are the age difference (19 years), the dynamic of their relationship where Justin was financially supporting her, and the fact that she felt the relationship wasn't based on love from her side. She broke up when she gained financial stability, which might have changed the balance of their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider intentions and communication. If AITA was never in love with Justin and the relationship was one-sided, then ending it isn't necessarily wrong. However, breaking up because she became financially stable might be seen as using Justin for support, which could be a point against her. But she didn't start the relationship just for that; she was in a difficult situation and Justin was kind. The fact that she tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows she considered his feelings. \n\nAge and maturity could also play a role. Justin is much younger, so the relationship might not have been balanced in terms of emotional maturity. AITA might have felt she wasn't the right partner for Justin's future. Also, the fact that Justin was her employer initially adds a layer of potential power imbalance, though they were adults in a consensual relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that she left when things got easier, which is selfish. Others might see it as her prioritizing her own needs after being in a dependent situation. The question is about being in the wrong, which usually relates to violating expectations or harming someone unjustly. If the relationship was never built on mutual love, then ending it isn't wrong. However, the way she broke up and not considering Justin's feelings might make some think she's in the wrong. \n\nBut given the information, she wasn't abusive or deceitful. She was honest about not loving him and tried to be considerate. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The age difference and financial dependency could make people have mixed feelings, but if she's not in love and the breakup is clean, it's not her fault.\n"
