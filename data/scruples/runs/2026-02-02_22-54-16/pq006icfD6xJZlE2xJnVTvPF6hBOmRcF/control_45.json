We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author is 29, her ex is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Aspergers, which might affect how he handles relationships. She moved in with him, he supported her financially when she lost her job. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, she feels bad but moved out.\n\nNow, the ethical angle. When someone is in a relationship, communication is key. The author didn't love him but stayed for financial stability. That's a red flag. She used him to some extent, which might be seen as exploiting him. When she got better opportunities, she left, which is her right, but the way she handled it matters. Breaking up after the fact without addressing the imbalance in the relationship could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut also, she's improving her life. It's not uncommon for people to leave relationships when their circumstances change. However, the lack of love from the start and the financial dependency might tip the scales. The question is whether she had a responsibility to stay or to be upfront earlier. Since she didn't love him, maybe she should have ended it before getting too involved, but since she stayed for financial reasons, she might be in the wrong now.\n\nAlternatively, she's making a choice for her own betterment. But the fact that she took advantage of his financial support and then left when she could support herself might make her the asshole. The answer isn't clear-cut, but there's a sense of using him, especially since she didn't love him. So maybe A (she's in the wrong) is the answer here.\n"
