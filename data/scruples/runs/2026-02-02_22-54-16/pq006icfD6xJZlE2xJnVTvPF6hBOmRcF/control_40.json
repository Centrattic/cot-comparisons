We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup after the author gets a job. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, looking at the details provided. The author is 29, their boyfriend Justin is 20, with Asperger's. They started dating after the author was hired to clean his apartment. The author was in a difficult financial situation, moving in with Justin because their own apartment was bad. Justin provided financial support, clothes, groceries, etc., since the author was struggling. The author didn't love Justin but didn't want to be casual. Then the author got a good job, saved money, and broke up with Justin, who is now upset.\n\nSo the main question is whether breaking up after getting a better job is wrong. The author's reasoning is that they didn't love him, but Justin was investing a lot emotionally and financially. The author tried to console Justin, even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which Justin rejected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The age difference is 9 years. Justin is 20, which is young, and the author is 29. There could be a power imbalance here, especially with Justin's Asperger's. He might not have the emotional maturity to handle a breakup well. The author was in a financially vulnerable position, relying on Justin for support. When the author got a better job, they became more financially stable, which probably gave them the freedom to leave.\n\nBut the key point is the author's feelings. They stated they don't love Justin. In a healthy relationship, both parties should be able to give and receive love. If the author isn't in love, it's reasonable to end the relationship. However, Justin was investing heavily, and the author might have led him on, especially since they initially thought it was casual but ended up moving in together. The author's decision to break up after securing a job could be seen as using Justin as a financial support system and then leaving once they no longer needed that.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship where they don't love the other person. Relationships require mutual affection. The author tried to offer an alternative (friends with benefits), which Justin rejected. Maybe the author is being responsible by choosing their own needs and not staying in a relationship out of obligation.\n\nHowever, the way the breakup was handled might be questionable. Justin was devastated, and the author feels bad. There's a possibility that the relationship was unequal, with Justin providing more emotional and financial support than the author was able to reciprocate. The author's financial situation changed, so they no longer needed Justin's support, leading to the breakup. But maybe the author should have been more upfront about their feelings earlier instead of letting things progress as far as moving in together.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have the right to choose their own happiness and relationships. However, there's a potential for manipulation or taking advantage of Justin's situation. Since relationships require mutual feelings, the author's lack of love makes the breakup understandable. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
