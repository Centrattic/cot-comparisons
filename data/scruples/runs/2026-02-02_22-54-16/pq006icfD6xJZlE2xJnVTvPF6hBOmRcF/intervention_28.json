We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, started a relationship, and she moved in with him. He was providing financial support since she was in a lower-paying job, but now she's landed a better job and left the relationship.\n\nFirst, she doesn't love him the way he loves her. That's a classic reason for breaking up. Justin was giving her financial help, but she was clear about not being in love. Then, when she gets a better job, she decides to break up, which she had probably been considering all along. She tried to explain it's better for them to part ways, even suggested friends with benefits which he rejected. Moving out into a better apartment because of her new job makes sense financially. \n\nThe age difference is significant (9 years), which can lead to different life goals and expectations. Justin's Asperger's might affect how he handles the breakup, maybe making it harder for him to cope. However, that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. She's prioritizing her own needs and future, which is understandable. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key points are mutual understanding of the relationship status, financial dependency, and personal growth. If she was honest about her feelings and not leading him on, then she's justified. But if she gave him false hope or didn't communicate properly, maybe. The story says she was going to tell him it's strictly casual but he developed feelings. She then broke up with him when she had a better opportunity, which is a timing issue but not necessarily wrong if she's not in love. \n\nShe feels bad, but that's normal. The main issue is whether she was dishonest or manipulative. The answer here seems to be B (No), because she's making a decision based on her own needs and circumstances, and she tried to be upfront. Justin's reaction is unfortunate, but it's his response to the breakup, not her fault.\n"
