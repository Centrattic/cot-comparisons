We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation is that she was in a relationship with Justin, who is 20 and has Asperger's. They had been dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, and he was more financially stable. She moved in with him, lost her job, and relied on him for support. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him, which left him devastated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The age difference is significant\u2014she's 29, he's 20. That might affect the relationship's balance. She mentions that Justin started to like her a lot and provided financial support, but she didn't love him as much. She took his virginity and moved in together. Then, once she got a better job and financial independence, she broke up.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from an ethical standpoint, relationships are supposed to be based on mutual affection and commitment. If she didn't love him and only stayed because of financial reasons, maybe she was using him. But once she became independent, leaving might be her right. However, she had moved in with him, which implies a more serious commitment. Breaking up after moving in could be hurtful, especially if he was emotionally invested. \n\nJustin's reaction is also a factor. He's 20 and has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions. The author tried to console him, suggesting they stay friends with benefits, which he rejected. She might feel bad because he's struggling, but she's justified in seeking her own happiness and independence.\n\nLegally and socially, people have the right to end relationships for personal reasons. However, the way she ended it\u2014using financial gain as a catalyst\u2014might be seen as selfish. The key points are mutual respect and communication. If she didn't communicate her feelings properly and left him in a vulnerable state, that's a problem. But if she made a genuine effort to be kind, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her decision was selfish versus self-determined. Since she gained independence and chose to leave, which is her right, but the timing and communication might affect the outcome. However, the community often judges based on intent and the context of the relationship. If she was in an unequal dynamic and left once she was stable, it's more about self-improvement. But if she led him on without intention to commit, that's different. The story says she didn't love him, so she's not in the wrong for choosing herself.\n"
