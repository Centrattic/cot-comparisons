We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the woman broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman, who's 29, was in a one-year relationship with Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. She was in a low-paying job, cleaning apartments, and met him when she was hired to clean his condo. They got close, had a sexual relationship, and she moved in with him after losing her job. Justin provided financial support, buying her groceries, clothes, etc. She didn't love him as he loved her. Then she got a better-paying job, saved money, broke up with him, and he's upset. She tried to console him, suggested friends-with-benefits, but he was angry.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the moral aspects here. The main issue is breaking up after gaining financial stability. Was she in the wrong for leaving because she no longer needed his financial support? Or was she in the wrong for being in a relationship where she wasn't in love with him?\n\nJustin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships and breakups. He might have had deep feelings and struggled with the breakup. The woman was using him financially while she was in a tough spot. Once she became financially stable, she left. That could be seen as using him for support, which is a valid criticism. However, she was honest in her feelings and didn't force him to stay.\n\nOn the other hand, she wasn't in love with him and didn't want a serious relationship. She tried to be kind when breaking up and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement. But he rejected that, which is his reaction. \n\nThe woman's actions might be seen as pragmatic. She improved her financial situation and left when the relationship wasn't reciprocal. But some might argue that she led him on, especially if she accepted his support without being honest about her feelings. However, she moved in with him and accepted gifts, which could be seen as taking advantage of his feelings. \n\nAnother angle: Justin's age and his condition. At 20, he might be more emotionally sensitive. The woman is almost ten years older; perhaps she should have been more aware of his capacity to handle a breakup. But she did try to console him.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent, honesty, and the nature of the relationship. If the woman was never in love and only stayed because she needed financial help, leaving once she doesn't need it anymore isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way she handled the breakup might be questioned. Did she give him enough time to process, or did she rush into breaking up after getting her job? Also, moving in with him while knowing she didn't love him could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, there are arguments both ways. But since the woman was honest in her feelings and the breakup was based on her own needs and realization that she wasn't in love, it's more likely she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No). However, if she used him and wasn't upfront from the start, maybe A. But the story says she intended to tell him it was casual but he started loving her. So she wasn't upfront, which complicates things. But overall, she broke up when she realized she didn't love him and was trying to be kind. So leaning towards B.\n"
