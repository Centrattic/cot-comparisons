We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, they moved in together, and she lost her job. She didn't love him back as much as he loved her. Now she got a better job, saved money, and broke up. Justin is upset, but she feels bad.\n\nSo, first, she moved in with him partly because she lost her job and he was her financial support. That might have created a dependency. Now that she's doing better, she's moving out. The question is whether leaving is wrong.\n\nShe mentions she doesn't love him like he does. That's a key point. If she didn't have feelings for him, continuing the relationship might not be fair. But she did stay for a year and moved in with him. Then she left after her job improved. Maybe she felt she needed to leave because she didn't want to keep a relationship without mutual love. Or maybe she felt she could now afford to move out. \n\nJustin is 20 and maybe not emotionally mature, especially with Asperger's. He might have felt more attached. But responsibility in a relationship isn't just about love; communication matters. If she was going to leave, did she handle it properly? She tried to console him and offered friends with benefits, but he was angry. Maybe she could have been more considerate, but her main point is that she didn't love him. \n\nThe key factors: mutual respect, communication, and whether she wronged him. She ended the relationship when she realized she didn't have the same feelings. That's a common reason to break up. So, is it wrong? Maybe not. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship where the feelings aren't mutual. \n\nBut some might argue she took advantage of his kindness or left because she could, not because of his character. However, the story says she didn't love him and he was the one buying her things, not the other way around. She moved in with him because of her own financial issues. Now that she's better off, she's moving on. \n\nI think she's justified in ending the relationship because of lack of love. So answer B, no, she's not in the wrong.\n"
