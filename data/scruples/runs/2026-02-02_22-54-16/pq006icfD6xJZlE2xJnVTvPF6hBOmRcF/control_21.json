We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the author broke up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The boyfriend is younger, 20, and she's 29. They had been dating over a year, and she moved in with him after losing her job and he supported her financially.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a good job, saved money, and then broke up with him. He's devastated. She tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, but he got angry.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The author states she doesn't love him the way he does, which is a common reason to end a relationship. However, the financial dependency might be a factor. She relied on him financially for a time, and once she became more stable, she left. But she did move out and into her own apartment, which shows she's independent now.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, breaking up isn't inherently wrong. People can end relationships for their own reasons, especially if they don't feel the same level of love. However, the context includes that she might have been taking advantage of his feelings when she needed financial support. But once she became financially stable, she decided to end the relationship. That could be seen as using him, which might make her the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, she was honest about her feelings and tried to be kind. The fact that she was upfront and didn't force the relationship anymore. Also, she had her own reasons related to her priorities\u2014building her career and financial independence. That's a valid personal choice. However, the age difference and the power dynamic might play a role. Justin is 20, so he might be less experienced, and she's older. Maybe she took advantage of his inexperience or his condition (Asperger's) to some extent.\n\nBut the main issue is her lack of reciprocated feelings. If she never loved him, then continuing the relationship would be unfair. So, breaking up to be honest is the right move. However, the way she handled it\u2014suggesting friends with benefits after breaking up\u2014might have added to his distress. But he was the one who got angry at that suggestion, so maybe he's not handling it well.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, she's not acting out of malice. She's making a decision based on her feelings and needs. While some might argue she should have seen this coming when she started relying on him financially, the core issue is her honesty about not loving him. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
