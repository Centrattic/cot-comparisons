We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman is 29, her ex is 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a lower economic situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's and was a sweet but awkward person. They had a sexual relationship, and he started buying her things, even helped her move in. She lost her cleaning job and relied on him financially. She didn't love him but broke up when she got a better job. Now he's upset, and she feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to assess the ethical aspects here. She was in a relationship where he was providing financial support, but she didn't love him. She broke up when she became more financially stable. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people have the right to end relationships if they're not emotionally committed. But there's a possible imbalance here. He's younger, has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She took advantage of his financial support, and when she became independent, she left. That could be seen as exploiting him. However, she was honest in the breakup, tried to console him, and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nAlso, she was in a better position now, and relationships should be based on mutual affection. If she didn't love him, staying out of obligation might be worse. But the age difference and power dynamic might tip the scales. The fact that he was her financial support and she left once she didn't need it could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? On one hand, she ended a relationship where she wasn't in love, which is her right. On the other, she was dependent on him financially and then left when she could support herself. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship without mutual feelings. However, some might argue she should have been more considerate given his vulnerabilities. But the ethical responsibility to end a non-love relationship isn't a wrong act itself. So probably B.\n"
