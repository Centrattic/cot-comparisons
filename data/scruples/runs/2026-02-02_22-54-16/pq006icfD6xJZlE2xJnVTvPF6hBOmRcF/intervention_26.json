We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a better job. \n\nFirst, the relationship details: She's 29, he's 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was nice, gave her gifts, they moved in together. She was financially struggling, so she took odd jobs, including cleaning. She lost her job and then got a lower-paying one, so she relied on him financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Now she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she feels bad.\n\nThe key points here are her reasons for breaking up. She didn't love him, and the financial situation changed when she got a better job. She was moving up financially, which made her less dependent on him. But she also admits that she didn't love him as he loved her. So breaking up because of lack of love is a valid reason, regardless of the financial aspect. \n\nHowever, the financial dependency might complicate things. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, and he was her \"meal ticket\" when she was jobless. Now that she's financially stable, she left. But she also states she didn't have feelings for him. \n\nIn relationships, the primary factor is emotional connection. If there's no love, the relationship isn't sustainable. The job change might have been a catalyst, but the root issue was her lack of feelings. Justin's age (20) versus her age (29) might also be a factor in maturity and relationship expectations. \n\nShe tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he was upset. She moved out, so she took steps to leave. While she feels guilty, her decision was based on her emotional needs and financial independence, which are valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. The breakup was due to lack of love and her newfound independence, which are legitimate reasons. The answer should be B (No).\n"
