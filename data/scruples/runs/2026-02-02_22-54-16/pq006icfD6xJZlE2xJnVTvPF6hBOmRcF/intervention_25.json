We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a better job is in the wrong. The situation is that she was in a relationship with Justin, who's 20, and she's 29. They were together for over a year. She was cleaning his apartment and they started a relationship. He bought her things, they moved in together, but she didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she feels bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The age difference is notable\u2014Justin is 20, which is a minor in many places, but the user is 29. That might be a red flag. Wait, Justin being 20, depending on the country, he might be under 18 if the question is in a place where the age of majority is 18. Wait, the user is 29, Justin is 20. If they were in a relationship where Justin was 18 or younger, that would be a problem. But Justin is 20, which is an adult in most places. So that part might not be an issue. \n\nThen, she was taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They got close, had sex, and she moved in with him after losing her job. He was providing financially. She didn't love him, but he was emotionally invested. Then she got a better-paying job, became financially stable, and broke up. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she isn't. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as long as Justin was of age, the relationship wasn't illegal. Emotionally, she didn't love him but was in a relationship, which might be a problem. However, she ended it when she felt it wasn't right. She tried to be kind, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he wasn't okay with it. \n\nPossible angles: She might have led him on if she didn't have feelings. But she mentioned she didn't love him like he did. She moved in with him when she was in a bad apartment, which might have been a mistake. Then when she got her footing, she ended it. \n\nIs it fair to break up when you're no longer in a bad situation? Maybe. People have the right to leave relationships that don't fulfill them, even if the other person is emotionally attached. \n\nBut some might argue that she took advantage of his financial support to stabilize herself before leaving. However, she moved in with him before getting the job. She had a job that was lost, then got a new one. So maybe she wasn't exploiting him; she was in a tough spot. \n\nJustin's reaction\u2014being devastated\u2014is his responsibility in part because he was emotionally invested in a relationship where she didn't reciprocate the feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. She ended the relationship when it wasn't working for her, especially after gaining financial stability. The answer would be B, No.\n"
