We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that she was in a relationship with Justin, who's 20, and she's 29. They had been dating over a year. She was in a low-paying job, cleaning apartments, and he was more affluent. She moved in with him after losing her job, and he provided financial support. But she didn't love him like he did. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she feels bad.\n\nFirst, the age difference. Justin is 20, she's 29. That's a nine-year gap. Depending on the context, maybe that's a red flag, but not necessarily the main issue here. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. She started the relationship when she was in a bad financial situation, and he was her financial support. But she didn't love him reciprocally. Then she gets a better job, becomes more stable, and ends things.\n\nIs it wrong to leave someone when you're not in love anymore, especially when you were in a situation of financial dependency? The key points: she didn't love him, he was investing in her (buying clothes, groceries), but she wasn't committed. She broke up when she found financial stability. Some might say she was using him, but she wasn't in love. Others might say it's selfish to leave after he invested so much. However, staying in a relationship without love isn't healthy for either party. Also, the age gap and the fact that he was her financial support could be factors. But she ended it when she was able to support herself, which could be seen as responsible. So the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she left when she could, even if it hurt him. But maybe some would argue she should have been more honest earlier. But the main issue is lack of love and moving on when possible. So B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
