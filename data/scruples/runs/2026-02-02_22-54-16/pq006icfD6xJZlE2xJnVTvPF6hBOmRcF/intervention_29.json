We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe woman is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They had been dating over a year. She was working odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin when she was hired to clean his apartment. He has Asperger's and was awkward at first, but they started a relationship. She mentions that Justin was nice, funny, attractive, and good in bed. However, she didn't love him like he did. Justin supported her financially by buying groceries, clothes, and a winter coat, and she even moved in with him. She lost her job at the apartment cleaning company and had to take a lower-paying job, so Justin was her main source of financial support. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Justin was devastated, and she tried to console him but he was angry when she suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement.\n\nThe key points here are her motivations for the breakup. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, and he provided financial support. After getting a better job, she became financially stable and decided to leave. She didn't love him as much as he loved her, which is a common issue in relationships. Breaking up because one doesn't reciprocate feelings is usually considered acceptable. However, some might argue that she used him financially, especially since there's a significant age gap. But she didn't lie about her intentions initially, and she did move in with him. The fact that she left after becoming financially independent could be seen as her right to pursue her own life. Justin's reaction might be due to his age and Asperger's, which can affect how he handles emotions and breakups. The question is whether her actions were inconsiderate or if she had a valid reason. Since she didn't manipulate him and left when she felt ready, it's likely she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
