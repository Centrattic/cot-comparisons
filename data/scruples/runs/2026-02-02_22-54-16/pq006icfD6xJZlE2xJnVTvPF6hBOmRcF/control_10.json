We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 29, her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a financial struggle and did odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his social interactions. They started a relationship, and she ended up moving in with him after losing her previous job. Justin provided her with financial support like groceries, clothes, and a better living situation. The author doesn't love him but was using the relationship for financial stability. Now she got a better job, became financially stable, and broke up with him. Justin is devastated, and she feels bad.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author moved in with Justin partly because her apartment was crumbling and she lost her job. Justin was her financial support, but she didn't love him. Now that she has a good job, she leaves. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nIn terms of relationships, mutual respect and honesty are important. The author didn't love Justin, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship. However, the way she handled it might matter. She moved in with him, and he likely thought they were in a committed relationship. If she didn't communicate her feelings properly, that could be an issue. Also, she might have relied on his financial support, which could imply some level of commitment expected from him.\n\nBut on the other hand, she's taking responsibility for her own life now that she's stable. Ending a relationship because of lack of love isn't inherently wrong. However, the fact that she didn't love him from the start might be a problem. Did she enter the relationship with false intentions, knowing she didn't love him, just for financial gain? If so, that could be seen as using him, regardless of the outcome. But if she developed feelings and later realized she didn't love him, it's different.\n\nAlso, considering Justin's age (20 vs her 29) and his Asperger's, he might be more vulnerable or less able to navigate the relationship dynamics. If she left him in a vulnerable state, maybe that's an issue. But again, she's not obligated to stay in an unrequited relationship.\n\nThe key factors are: 1. Was she honest about her feelings from the start? 2. Did she use him for financial support without intending a committed relationship? 3. Did she break up in a respectful way?\n\nIn her story, she mentions she was going to tell him it's strictly casual but he started liking her more. So maybe she didn't communicate her intentions clearly. If she led him to believe there was a future when she never intended to love him, that's a problem. But if she was upfront, then maybe not. However, she admits she didn't love him, so staying in the relationship without love is arguably not fair to him. \n\nSo, in conclusion, while ending a relationship because you no longer want it isn't wrong, if she entered it with the knowledge she didn't love him and used him for financial support, that could be seen as manipulative. However, the situation is complicated by her financial circumstances. But overall, it's not entirely clear, but since she didn't love him and ended it when she could, maybe she's not at fault. But if she mislead him, then yes. But based on her account, she tried to be honest but he fell for her more than she intended. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
