We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Justin were in a relationship lasting over a year. Justin is 20, and the author is 29. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They started a relationship, and she moved in with him after losing her job. He provided financial support by buying her groceries and clothes. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now Justin is upset, and she feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. To determine this, we need to consider the ethical aspects of their relationship. The author was in a financially vulnerable position and relied on Justin's support. However, she didn't love him and broke up when her financial situation improved. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship when your circumstances change? Relationships require mutual care and commitment. If she never had feelings for him and only stayed for financial reasons, then leaving when she could support herself is understandable. But she should have been honest about her feelings earlier if possible. However, the story suggests she tried to make it work and only ended it when her situation changed. Justin's age and autism might affect his ability to handle the breakup, but that doesn't make her wrong for breaking up. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted in her own interest when she could, and the breakup was initiated by her due to her improved circumstances. The answer is B.\n"
