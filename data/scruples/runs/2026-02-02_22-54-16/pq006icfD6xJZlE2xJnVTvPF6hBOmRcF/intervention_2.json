We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The story is from an anonymous person who's 29, dating a 20-year-old named Justin, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She ended up moving in with him after losing her job, relying on him financially. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. Justin was upset, and she feels bad but thinks she's justified.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The woman was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on Justin. She got a better job, became more stable, and chose to leave. She felt the relationship wasn't based on love, just convenience. Justin, on the other hand, was emotionally invested and didn't see it that way. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants a second opinion. Let's consider both sides. From her perspective, she was in a situation where she was relying on someone who was significantly younger and maybe not emotionally mature. She got out of a financially unstable situation, improved her circumstances, and decided to leave when the relationship wasn't fulfilling. That's a choice someone might make to prioritize their own well-being and growth. \n\nOn Justin's side, he was emotionally invested, gave her financial support, and she moved in with him. When she left, he was devastated. But he's 20, which is a big age difference. He might not have fully understood the nature of the relationship or the dynamics. She might have led him on if she didn't feel the same level of commitment. However, she did try to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nLooking at relationship ethics, people have the right to leave a relationship if they're not happy or if their needs aren't met. The woman was honest about her feelings and made a choice based on her own situation. While breaking up is painful, it's not inherently wrong if the person isn't in love and chooses to move on when circumstances change. The fact that she was saving money and building a better life suggests she was acting in her own interest, which is reasonable. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional manipulation or taking advantage of someone's vulnerability. Justin was 20 and had Asperger's, which might affect his ability to understand social cues or the depth of the relationship. If she was aware of his condition and his emotional state, she might have a responsibility to be more transparent. However, the story doesn't indicate she was deceptive; she just didn't feel the same level of love. \n\nIn conclusion, while Justin's feelings are hurt, the woman isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own happiness and future. Relationships should be based on mutual feelings, and she made a difficult but honest choice once the circumstances changed. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
