We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation involves a significant age difference\u201429 vs. 20. The woman was in a financial struggle, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They started a relationship, and he supported her financially. She moved in with him after losing her job. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, feeling conflicted about how he's taking it.\n\nFirst, the age gap is 9 years. While not huge in some contexts, it can affect maturity levels. He's 20, which is still young, and she's 29. Maybe she was more emotionally mature, which could mean she had a role in ensuring their relationship was healthy. But the main issue is the breakup reasons.\n\nHe was supporting her financially when she wasn't working well. Now she's stable, so she left. The question is whether it's wrong to leave once she's in a better position. She mentions she didn't love him as he did. Ending a relationship because of lack of love isn't wrong. However, the way it's handled matters. She tried to console him and offer a friends-with-benefits, which he rejected. That shows she tried to be considerate, even if the offer backfired.\n\nAlso, the financial dependency aspect. He was her meal ticket, and she left when she became financially independent. That's a common situation where people might leave when they no longer need to stay for financial reasons. But was their relationship built on that dependency? If the relationship was based on her financial need rather than mutual love, then ending it when she's better off is valid.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual feelings. If she didn't love him and he was emotionally invested, but she was using him for support when she couldn't help herself, then her leaving when she could is not wrong. Relationships should be based on mutual affection, not just convenience or financial support. So, no, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
