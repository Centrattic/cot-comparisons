We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a nine-year gap. Justin is described as having Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships and emotions. The author initially didn't plan for a serious relationship but got into a situation where Justin started investing more\u2014buying her things, she moved in with him, and he became her financial support after she lost her job. She mentions not loving him as he does, and when she got a better job, she broke up.\n\nSo, the key points here are the power dynamics. Justin was providing financially when she was in a worse position, which might have created a dependency. Now that she's more stable, she's leaving. But she's not staying because she doesn't love him, not because she's taking advantage. She tried to be kind, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he was upset.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, people can end relationships for personal reasons, especially if there's a lack of mutual love. She's not using him for money anymore; she's leaving when she's more stable. Justin's reaction is his to handle. The author might feel bad, but it's not her fault if he's upset. The dynamic was unequal before, but she's choosing her own happiness now. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
