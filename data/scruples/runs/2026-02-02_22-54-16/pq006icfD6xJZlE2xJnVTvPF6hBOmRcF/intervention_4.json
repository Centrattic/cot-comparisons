We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a nine-year gap. Not sure if that's relevant, but maybe. Then, she was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They met through that job. He has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional processing. They started a relationship, and she moved in with him after losing her job. He supported her financially, buying her things. But she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and he's upset. She tried to stay friends, but he was angry.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The user thinks she's not, but wants others' opinions. So, I need to consider if leaving a relationship when your financial situation improves is valid. She mentions it wasn't love, so maybe she was using him, but she also says he was kind. The fact that she moved in with him when she needed help could imply some level of dependence. But then, when she became financially stable, she left. Is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, compatibility and mutual feelings matter. If she didn't love him, leaving isn't inherently wrong. But the financial aspect complicates things. Did she take advantage? She moved in with him when she needed support, and when she was stable, left. That might come off as using him. However, she was honest enough to tell him it could be casual at first, but he got attached. Then she stayed because he was supportive. When she got the job, she decided to leave. \n\nThe key points: she didn't force him into anything; he chose to invest emotionally and financially. She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits, which he rejected. She moved out. So, she's taking responsibility for her decision. The issue is whether her decision to leave when her financial situation improved is fair. In relationships, people can grow and change. If the relationship was based on mutual support but lacked love, then moving on isn't necessarily wrong. She's not keeping him against his will. However, the transition from dependent to independent might have been abrupt for him, especially with his Asperger's. \n\nBut overall, if the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she's choosing her independence, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. She's not the one who forced the situation; she made a choice when her circumstances changed. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance where she should have been more considerate of his feelings, but that's separate from being in the wrong.\n"
