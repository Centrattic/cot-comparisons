We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were in a relationship with Justin, who's 20, and the author is 29. They had been dating over a year. The author was cleaning apartments, including Justin's. Justin has Asperger's and was awkward at first but then became a good person, buying her stuff and even letting her move in with him. The author mentions they didn't love him like he did, and when she got a better job, she broke up with him. Justin is upset, and she feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a relationship that might have been based on some financial dependency. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, lost her job, and then Justin was providing for her. But when she got a good job, she broke up. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Did she mislead Justin about the relationship? The author says she was going to tell him it's strictly casual but didn't because he liked her more. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries early on. On the other hand, she could have realized later that she wasn't in love and decided to end it for her own well-being. \n\nJustin's age is 20, which is a young adult. The author is 29, which is an 9-year age difference. Age differences can sometimes affect the dynamics, especially if there's a power imbalance. But it's not necessarily a problem in itself. However, if Justin's maturity level is lower due to Asperger's, that might complicate things. The author moving in with him and relying on him financially could have made the relationship unequal.\n\nThe key point here is the author deciding to break up after securing a better job. Is that selfish? She might have felt she needed to move on because she wasn't in love, and the financial situation might have been a factor in her decision. But Justin was providing for her, and she left him when he was probably more invested. The fact that she suggested friends with benefits but that made him angry shows he wanted more than that. \n\nWas the breakup justified? If the author didn't have feelings for him, it's her right to end the relationship. However, if Justin was vulnerable due to his Asperger's and age, maybe she should have been more considerate. But the author also mentions that she was in a bad financial situation before and after moving in with him, which might have affected her decisions. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because she's choosing her own independence and happiness after building up her financial stability. However, the way she handled it could be questionable if she didn't address the emotional aspect properly. But the main reason for the breakup is her lack of love, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the flip side, if the relationship was unequal with Justin providing financial support and her leaving after becoming financially stable, some might see it as her using him. But the author says she didn't love him, which is a personal feeling she can't control. \n\nThe answer might be B, not in the wrong, because she's prioritizing her own situation and she's honest about her feelings. But others might argue that she should have been more upfront or that the age and condition make her responsible for his well-being. However, the core issue is her lack of love, which is a legitimate reason to break up, even if it's hard to say.\n"
