We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's 29, her ex is 20, they were dating over a year. She was taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, which might mean he handles emotional situations differently. She ended up moving in with him after losing her job, relying on his support. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, age difference. They're 9 years apart. That's not a huge gap, but he's still relatively young. She mentions he's attractive and good in bed, but she doesn't love him. Maybe she was using him for financial support? She took his virginity and he started buying her things. Then she moved in with him when her apartment was bad. So maybe she was taking advantage of his kindness. Then when she got a better job, she left. That seems like she was using him during a tough time and then left once she was stable. \n\nBut wait, she did try to be upfront about it being casual at one point? Or she thought she was going to tell him it was casual, but he started loving her. She moved in with him, which implies a more committed relationship. Then when she got a better job, she left. She says she doesn't love him like he does. So maybe she wasn't honest about her feelings. He might have thought they were in a real relationship, and she just left once she had financial security. That could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut also, she was in a bad financial situation. Moving in with him was to escape a crumbling apartment. Maybe she didn't have many options. The fact that he's in a better financial position helped her. But once she got a good job, she left. The question is whether breaking up was fair. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She feels bad, so maybe she's conflicted. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If she was in a relationship and then left once her situation improved, without considering his feelings. He's 20, which is young, and she's 29. Maybe he's not emotionally equipped to handle the breakup well because of Asperger's. But does that make her responsible? Or is it her right to leave when she's not in love with him? \n\nIn some perspectives, if she was in a relationship and not in love, and left when her circumstances changed, that's her prerogative. But if she led him on, made him believe it was a real relationship, and then left, maybe that's the issue. The fact that she was using his financial support could be a problem. But maybe they were just both helping each other out. \n\nSo, breaking down the main points: mutual moving in, financial dependency, her decision to leave after securing a job, and his emotional distress. The key is whether she was honest about her intentions. She said she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started loving her. So maybe she wasn't clear. If he thought it was a real relationship, she's in the wrong for leading him on. If she was honest, maybe not. Since she ended it when she got a job, maybe she's prioritizing her own needs, which is okay. But the way she handled the breakup could be a problem. \n\nI think the community would debate this. Some might say she's not the asshole because she's leaving a relationship where she wasn't in love. Others might say she used him. But considering she tried to console him and he's struggling, maybe she's not the asshole. Wait, but she was moving in with him, which is a big step. So she might have given him the impression of a committed relationship, which he took seriously. If she knew she wasn't in love, maybe she should have been more upfront. The fact that she was taking his financial support and then leaving could be seen as using him. But she was in a tough spot financially. \n\nHmm. The question is if she's in the wrong. The answer could be either way. But in AITA scenarios, if someone leaves a relationship when they're not in love, even if they were benefiting from the other person, it's often not considered the asshole. However, if there was a lack of honesty about intentions, that could tip it. Since she mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but he started loving her, maybe she should have been clearer. But she did move in with him, which is a sign of commitment. So maybe she's in the wrong for leading him on. Alternatively, maybe it's his responsibility for getting attached despite her initial intentions. \n\nI think the community would vote B (not the asshole) because she's making a choice based on her own happiness and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't love the person. However, the way she handled the breakup could be seen as insensitive. But in AITA terms, the main question is if she's the asshole, and the answer is often B if the person is acting in their own best interest. So probably B.\n"
