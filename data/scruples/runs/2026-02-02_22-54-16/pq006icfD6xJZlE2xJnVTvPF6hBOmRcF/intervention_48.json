We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. The main points are the age difference, financial situations, and the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20. There's a significant age gap. The author was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. They started a relationship, and Justin provided financial support since the author lost their job and had to take a lower-paying one. The author didn't love Justin but stayed with him, possibly for financial reasons. Then, after getting a better job and saving money, the author broke up with Justin, moving out and into a new apartment. Justin is upset, and the author feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider consent, honesty, and mutual respect. The author was honest about their feelings? The story says they didn't love Justin but didn't tell him it was casual. Instead, they moved in together, which might imply a more committed relationship. However, the author might have been in a vulnerable position financially, relying on Justin. When the author got a better job, they felt they didn't need the relationship anymore. Breaking up when financial dependency is no longer an issue might be seen as self-reliance. On the other hand, Justin might have invested emotionally and financially, expecting a committed relationship. The author didn't communicate their feelings clearly from the start, leading to Justin's investment. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not clarifying their intentions? If the author didn't love Justin but stayed in the relationship for financial reasons, that could be seen as using him. However, in relationships, people can have different priorities, and when circumstances change (like better job), ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the author was honest about their feelings. If they were upfront, maybe it's not their fault. But if they led Justin on, then maybe they are. The story says they were going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started loving them. So they didn't explicitly set boundaries, which might be a problem. But given their financial situation, maybe they couldn't set those boundaries earlier. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they broke up when they could be self-sufficient, and the relationship wasn't based on love from the author's side. However, there's an argument that they should have been more upfront. But considering the circumstances, the decision to end the relationship when they are stable is reasonable.\n"
