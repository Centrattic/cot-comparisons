We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex is 20, named Justin. They were dating a little over a year. She was in a financial struggle, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He lives in a luxury condo in a gentrified area. They met through her cleaning job. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They had a physical relationship, she took his virginity. He bought her things like groceries and a coat. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. She lost her cleaning job and got a lower-paying one, so Justin was her financial support. She doesn't love him as he does. She got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, leading to him being devastated. She tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, but he was angry. She moved out, feels bad.\n\nFirst, she was in a relationship where she was in a better financial position now. But initially, Justin was supporting her financially. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, and he was her meal ticket when she wasn't working well. Now she has a better job, so she's more stable. She doesn't love him, which is a key point. The breakup after gaining financial stability. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nShe ended the relationship because she didn't love him. That's a valid reason. But Justin was younger, 20, and she's 29. There's a 9-year age gap. He had Asperger's, which might affect his emotional handling. She took his virginity and the relationship was physical. She tried to console him, but he was upset. She offered friends with benefits, which he rejected. The key factors: she didn't love him, ended the relationship when she felt right about it. But she was in a position where he was supporting her financially, then she left when she became more stable. So maybe he felt abandoned. But ethically, she had the right to end the relationship because of lack of love. Financial dependency can be an issue, but it's not her fault she got a better job. She wasn't in love, so leaving isn't wrong. Also, she was in a precarious situation before. Now she's better off. The question is whether her decision to leave was wrong. Since she didn't love him, and the relationship wasn't healthy in terms of her depending on him financially while not reciprocating feelings, she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
