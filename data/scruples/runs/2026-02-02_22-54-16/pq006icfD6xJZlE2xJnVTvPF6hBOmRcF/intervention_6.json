We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job. They were together for over a year. She was in a bad financial situation, worked odd jobs, and moved in with him because her apartment was crumbling. The boyfriend has Asperger's, was awkward at first but became a sweetheart. He bought her things, supported her, and she moved in with him. She didn't love him the way he loved her, though. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him, and he's devastated. She tried to be friends with benefits, but he got angry. She feels bad but moved out.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's the asshole. I need to decide if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the age difference: 29 vs. 20. That's a nine-year gap. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be age of consent laws, but since they're both adults, that's probably not an issue. But there's a maturity difference. She's older, more experienced. He's younger, and has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She was taking care of more expenses because her job was low-paying, and then she moved in with him. She says she didn't love him, but he did love her. \n\nShe broke up with him after getting a better job. So, her financial situation improved, and she felt she could move out. But was the breakup because of the job? She mentions she didn't love him like he did. So maybe the breakup was about not loving him, but the job made it possible to leave. \n\nIs it wrong to leave someone because you don't love them? Generally, no. If a relationship is one-sided, ending it isn't the wrong. But the way it's handled matters. She tried to be friends with benefits but he got angry. Maybe that's a communication issue. But he's 20 and has Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to adjust to the change. \n\nAlso, she was in a bad financial situation and relied on him for some support. Now that she's in a better position, she leaves. But she wasn't in a healthy relationship if she wasn't reciprocating the love. However, the fact that she's moving on with her life and improving her situation is positive. \n\nThe key points are: she didn't love him, he loved her, she left when she could financially. Her intentions seem genuine in ending a relationship that wasn't fulfilling for her. The fact that she tried to console him shows she cares about his feelings. The issue is whether leaving for personal reasons (lack of love) is wrong, especially when it's a one-sided relationship. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's ending a relationship where her feelings aren't reciprocated. However, there might be nuances, like if she used him financially, but she mentions she moved in with him out of her bad apartment and lost her job, so it's not clear if she exploited him. Her main reason is lack of love, so it's not about being selfish for bettering her life. The boyfriend's reaction is part of the situation, but that doesn't make her wrong. So B seems right.\n"
