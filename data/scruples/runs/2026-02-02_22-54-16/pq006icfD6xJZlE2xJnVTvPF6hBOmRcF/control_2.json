We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's 29, her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a tough financial situation, moving in with him, and he was supporting her with groceries, clothes, etc. They had a relationship, and she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. She was in a financial need, and he was providing for her. But she didn't love him. That's a red flag. Relationships should be based on mutual affection and respect, not just financial support. She moving in with him and accepting his gifts while not reciprocating emotional investment might have been unfair to him.\n\nThen she breaks up when she gets a better job. That could be seen as exploiting his generosity. She knew he had Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. Ending the relationship for financial reasons after he invested so much could be hurtful. Even if she felt she needed to move on, the way she handled it\u2014suggesting friends with benefits later\u2014might have added insult to injury.\n\nHowever, she's also in a vulnerable financial position and took steps to improve her situation. Her decision to leave might be about seeking stability and independence. But the key issue here is whether she was honest about her feelings from the start. If she never intended to be in a committed relationship and only stayed because of financial need, that's a problem. She should have communicated her feelings to avoid leading him on.\n\nOn the other hand, the age difference is significant. Justin is 20, which is still young, and she's 29. There's a power imbalance there. Also, the fact that she moved in with him and accepted his support while not reciprocating emotionally is a concern. She might have used him for financial stability, which isn't right regardless of her own situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: She had a relationship where she wasn't in love with him, accepted his financial support, and then left when her circumstances improved. That seems to indicate she was in the wrong for not being honest about her intentions and for creating an unequal dynamic. However, her financial hardship is a factor. But in a healthy relationship, both parties should contribute emotionally. She's responsible for not setting boundaries or being upfront. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's the asshole).\n"
