We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 29, her ex is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was a nice guy who bought her things and she moved in with him. She didn't love him but broke up after getting a better job and saving money. He's upset and she feels bad.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the arguments from both sides. On one hand, she broke up when she felt ready, possibly due to financial stability. On the other hand, he was emotionally attached and she didn't love him, which is valid, but maybe she should have been clearer about her intentions from the start.\n\nWait, she mentioned she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to like her. Maybe she led him on a bit. But she did move in with him and accepted his support. However, when she got a better job, she decided to leave. Is it fair to leave because of financial independence? That's a common issue, but maybe she should have communicated better. But she tried to console him and offer friendship. \n\nThe key points: She didn't love him, he loved her, she left when her circumstances changed. People can have different views on relationships. Some might say it's okay to leave when you're not in love, others might say she should have been honest about her feelings earlier. Since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, the main factors are her lack of love and her decision to leave. If she didn't love him, ending the relationship isn't wrong. But if she gave false hope, maybe she is. However, the user's perspective is that she's not, and considering the dynamics, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
