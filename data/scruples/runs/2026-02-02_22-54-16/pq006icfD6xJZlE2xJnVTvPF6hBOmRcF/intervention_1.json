We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They were in a relationship for over a year, during which she was in a low-income situation and he provided financial support. The woman ended the relationship after securing a better job and moving out, leading to the boyfriend's devastation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The woman mentions she was taking odd jobs, including cleaning, and that she moved in with him because her apartment was crumbling. Justin provided her with financial support, including groceries, clothes, and a winter coat. However, she clarifies that she doesn't love him in the same way he does. She ended the relationship when she got a better job, which allowed her to save money and move into her own place.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference (29 vs. 20), the financial dependency, and the emotional imbalance. Justin is 20, which is legal adulthood, but he has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. The woman was in a position where she was financially reliant on him, but once she became more independent, she decided to leave. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, both parties should ideally be able to support each other emotionally and financially. However, if one person is in a position of providing for the other and the relationship becomes unbalanced, it's not necessarily wrong to seek a better position. The woman wasn't in a loving relationship by her own admission, so ending it might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of exploitation. If Justin's financial support was a significant factor in their relationship, and she left once she could be independent, it could be seen as using him. But the user's perspective is that she's not in the wrong because she felt the relationship wasn't based on love and she was able to move on. \n\nAlso, the age gap and the power dynamic might play a role. A 29-year-old and a 20-year-old have different life stages. She might be at a point where she wants more stability, while he's still in an earlier stage. The fact that he was providing financial support could create a dependency that's not healthy for either party. \n\nThe woman's decision to break up when she became more financially stable could be seen as making a necessary life change. If the relationship wasn't based on mutual love, ending it to pursue her own happiness might be justified. However, the way she handled the breakup could be scrutinized. She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That might indicate she didn't want to completely cut ties, but his reaction shows he was deeply affected.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the relationship wasn't healthy or based on love, ending it for personal growth isn't necessarily wrong. But there's also the consideration of the impact on someone with Asperger's, who might struggle more with emotional transitions. However, the responsibility isn't solely on the woman to stay in an unfulfilling relationship just because of his condition.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the woman's actions seem to be about seeking her own stability and happiness, which is a valid reason. She wasn't in love, and the relationship had financial imbalances. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
