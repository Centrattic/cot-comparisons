We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a good job is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They had been dating over a year, she moved in with him after losing her job, and he provided financially. She didn't love him but broke up when she got a better job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Age difference is significant\u20147 years. The man has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She mentions a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he wanted more. She moved in with him and relied on his support financially. Then she gets a better job, becomes more stable, and decides to break up. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in relationships, mutual affection and commitment are important. She didn't love him, so staying for his support might not have been fair. But she did move in and accept his gifts, which implies some level of commitment. Breaking up when she found financial stability could be seen as self-serving, but she did try to console him and explain. He was emotionally attached, while she wasn't. \n\nIn some perspectives, people shouldn't stay in relationships out of financial necessity if they don't have feelings. However, the way she ended it might be harsh, especially since he was emotionally invested. But since she didn't love him and couldn't continue the relationship, it's not entirely her fault. The question is whether she's the asshole. The key points are honesty, communication, and fairness. If she had been honest from the start that it was casual, maybe it's different. But since she let him believe there was a future and then left when better circumstances came, that could be seen as using him. However, she did move out and try to explain. \n\nSo, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But according to common AITA standards, if someone is in a committed relationship and leaves for personal gain without mutual love, they might be considered the asshole. But since she wasn't in love and did break up when possible, maybe not. The community might have mixed views, but leaning towards her not being the asshole since she couldn't force feelings. But the fact that she accepted his support and then left might tip the scales. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe she's not in the wrong because staying without love isn't sustainable, but the execution might be seen as harsh. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
