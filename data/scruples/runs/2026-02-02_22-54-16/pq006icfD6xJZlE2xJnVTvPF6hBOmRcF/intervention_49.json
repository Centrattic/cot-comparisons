We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's 29, he's 20. They've been dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He's got Asperger's and was awkward but sweet. They started a relationship, he provided financial support (groceries, clothes, moving in), but she didn't love him as much. She got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and now he's upset. She's feeling guilty but thinks she's not in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole (ITA) or not (AITA). The user thinks she's not wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLooking at the key points here: The relationship was unequal in terms of financial support. She was using his resources, and he was providing a lot, but she wasn't in love with him. When she became financially stable, she chose to leave. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, it's common for people to leave relationships where they feel unfulfilled, especially if there's a lack of mutual love. However, the age difference and the power dynamic might play a role. She was financially dependent on him, which could have created an imbalance. But when she became independent, she ended the relationship. \n\nThe fact that she didn't love him is a significant factor. Staying in a relationship without love can be emotionally draining for both parties. Ending it when she's able to be self-sufficient seems reasonable. Also, she tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she's trying to be considerate, even if it didn't work out. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she used him financially and then left without considering his feelings. But given that the relationship wasn't based on love from her side, and she was honest about her lack of feelings, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. He also has Asperger's, which might affect his ability to process the breakup, but that doesn't shift the blame to her. \n\nSo, considering all factors: no mutual love, financial dependence that's resolved, and her decision to leave when she's stable, I think the answer is B (not wrong).\n"
