We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with Justin, who's 20 and has Asperger's. They've been dating over a year. The author is 29 and struggling financially, working odd jobs including cleaning Justin's apartment. Justin is from a more affluent background. They started a relationship, and the author ended up moving in with him after losing their job. The author doesn't love Justin but stays, partly because Justin is providing financial support. Then the author gets a better job, saves money, and breaks up with Justin, leading to his devastation.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is the asshole (ITA). The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the key points. The author didn't love Justin but stayed in the relationship, possibly because of financial reasons. When they got a better job, they broke up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after becoming more financially stable.\n\nFrom the information given, the author might have been in a one-sided relationship where their feelings weren't mutual. Justin was investing more, providing financial support, but the author didn't reciprocate emotionally. When the author's financial situation improved, they ended the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual feelings are important. The author didn't love Justin, which is a significant factor. However, breaking up when things are going well financially could be seen as using Justin for support. But the key point is that the author was honest in the breakup, even though they might have been aware of Justin's feelings earlier. \n\nJustin's age and Asperger's might affect his ability to understand social cues or emotional reciprocity, but the author is responsible for their own actions. The author could have communicated their feelings earlier instead of staying in a relationship where they weren't emotionally invested. However, once the author's circumstances changed, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong if there's a lack of mutual affection. \n\nThe author did try to console Justin and offered a friendship, but Justin rejected that. The guilt the author feels might be valid, but the action itself\u2014ending a relationship where love wasn't mutual\u2014might not make them the asshole. The main issue is the initial decision to stay in the relationship without loving Justin, which could be a bigger problem than the breakup itself. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship after realizing it wasn't what they wanted, especially since they were honest about their feelings. But some might argue they should have been honest earlier. However, the question is whether the breakup itself makes them the asshole. Given the context, the answer is more likely B (not the asshole).\n"
