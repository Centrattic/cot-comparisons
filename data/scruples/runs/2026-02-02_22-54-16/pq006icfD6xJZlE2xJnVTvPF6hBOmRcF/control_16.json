We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. The user is 29, the boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. She was taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She met him through that job. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They had sex, and she took his virginity. She didn't want a serious relationship but he started treating her nicely, bought her things, and she moved in with him. She lost her previous job and had to take a lower-paying one, so Justin was her main support.\n\nNow, she got a good job with better pay, built up savings, and broke up with him. He's devastated. She tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, which made him angry. She moved out. She feels bad but is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points here are the power dynamics, the age difference, financial dependency, and the decision to break up. The woman was in a situation where she was financially dependent on Justin, which might have influenced her staying in the relationship longer than she wanted. When she got a better job, she became more financially independent and decided to leave. \n\nAge difference is significant: 29 vs. 20. Justin is much younger, which might affect the relationship dynamics. The woman might have been taking advantage of his good nature, especially since he has Asperger's, which could make him more trusting or less able to read social cues. She mentions she didn't love him as he loved her, indicating a lack of reciprocated feelings. \n\nBreaking up after gaining financial independence could be seen as her taking control of her life. However, the way she handled the breakup might matter. She did try to be kind, but friends with benefits upset him. Did she have a responsibility to stay longer? Or is she justified in pursuing her own happiness now that she has financial stability?\n\nAlso, Justin's reaction being devastated and angry might stem from his investment in the relationship and the sudden loss of a partner who was financially supported by him. But since she was the one who initiated the breakup, maybe the blame isn't hers. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If a relationship is based on one person's love and the other not reciprocating, and then the person leaves when they can support themselves, that's a choice. However, if she was using him for financial support without emotional commitment, that could be problematic. But the story says she didn't want a serious relationship at first, but she moved in with him and accepted gifts. So maybe she's in a situation where she benefited from the relationship but ended it when it suited her. \n\nBut the key point is that she didn't love him and he did. Ending a relationship when you realize you don't have feelings for someone isn't necessarily wrong. However, the financial dependency aspect is tricky. If she was relying on him financially and then left, some might argue she's being selfish. But she's also taking control of her life after gaining stability. \n\nIn terms of the age difference and Justin's Asperger's, there's a potential power imbalance. She might have been in a position where she could have considered his vulnerability. But she also has a right to pursue her own life and happiness. \n\nSo, considering all factors: she didn't force him into the relationship, he chose to support her. She ended it when she could be independent, which is fair. The fact that she tried to be kind and even offered a friends with benefits might not be the best approach, but the core decision to break up isn't inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not the asshole). But maybe there's a nuance where she should have considered his feelings more. However, since the primary issue is her lack of reciprocated love and her financial independence, the breakup is justified. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
