We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The question is framed as an \"Am I the asshole?\" (AITA) scenario, which is common on forums like Reddit.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The woman is 29, her ex is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, she moved in with him, and then she broke up after getting a better job. The main issue here is whether ending the relationship for personal advancement makes her the asshole.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to see if that's justified. Let's consider the dynamics. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. Justin is 20, which is a time when many people are still in school or early in their careers. The author was in a financial position where she needed odd jobs, and Justin provided some financial support. When she got a better job, she became more financially stable, which allowed her to move out and end the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to have mutual feelings and goals. The author mentions she doesn't love Justin as much as he loves her. That's a key point. If someone is in a relationship not based on love but because of financial dependence, that can be problematic. The author's decision to break up might be seen as her recognizing that the relationship wasn't healthy or fulfilling for her emotionally. She's prioritizing her financial independence and personal growth, which is a valid reason to end a relationship where the emotional connection is lacking.\n\nHowever, Justin's reaction is also a consideration. He's 20 and has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. The breakup could be tough for him, especially if he was emotionally invested. But does that mean the author is in the wrong? Not necessarily. Everyone has the right to their own happiness and to make decisions that benefit their life, even if it's hard on the other person. The author tried to console him and suggested a friends-with-benefits situation, which he rejected. That shows she attempted to be considerate, even if it didn't work out.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Justin was providing financial support, which might have created an imbalance. The author moving out after gaining financial stability addresses that imbalance. It's important in relationships to have equality, and the author's step towards independence is a positive move.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the analysis, she's making a choice to prioritize her own needs and growth, which is reasonable. There's no indication of malicious intent; she's honest about not loving him and is breaking up when the situation allows her to be independent. So, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
