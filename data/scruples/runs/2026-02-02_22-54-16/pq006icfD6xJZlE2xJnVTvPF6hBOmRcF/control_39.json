We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and her ex-boyfriend is 20. They were together for over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He's in a luxury condo, which shows some financial disparity. He has Asperger's, which might make relationships more challenging for him.\n\nShe mentions that he was her \"meal ticket\" because he provided groceries, clothes, and they lived together. She took a lower-paying job afterward, implying her financial situation was unstable. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. She tried to stay friends with benefits, but he was upset. Now she's moving out and feeling bad.\n\nSo, the main points here: she broke up after securing better financial stability. He was younger, possibly emotionally invested more, and she ended things when she was in a better position. Is she the asshole?\n\nWell, in relationships, both parties should ideally be on equal footing. If she was dependent on him financially before, then moving on after she's stable might not be her fault, especially if the relationship wasn't based on mutual respect or love. However, the fact that she was in a position of power where she was financially supported by him before might complicate things. But since she ended it when she was in a better place, maybe that's her right. Also, she didn't love him as much as he loved her, which is a valid reason to break up. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of using him for financial support. If that was a factor, maybe that's a red flag. However, the user says she didn't mean to imply that; she just mentions she was in a poor situation. She also tried to console him and offer a friendship, which shows she's considerate. He had a hard time accepting it, which might be due to his Asperger's affecting how he processes emotions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, she made a choice based on her own feelings and circumstances. As long as she wasn't manipulative or deceptive, ending a relationship where there's imbalance in emotional investment isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, she's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
