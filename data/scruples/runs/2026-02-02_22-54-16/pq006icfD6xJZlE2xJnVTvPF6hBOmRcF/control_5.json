We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman ending her relationship with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman was in a relationship with Justin, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She mentions he was kind but she didn't love him. She left after getting a good job, which allowed her to be financially independent. Now she's feeling bad about how he's reacting.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. To determine that, I should consider factors like consent, manipulation, emotional harm, and whether there's any coercion involved. \n\nJustin's age is 20, and hers is 29. In some places, there could be age of consent issues, but since both are adults, that's probably not the issue here. She mentions they started as a casual relationship but he became more committed. She took his virginity but didn't want a serious relationship. She relied on him financially when she lost her job, which might have created an imbalance. Now that she's financially stable, she ended the relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether she was using him or if she had a clear intention to leave once she got a better job. She states she didn't love him, which is a valid reason for breaking up. However, moving in together while expecting a casual relationship might have been misleading. Also, using him as a financial support while she was jobless could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nOn the other hand, she ended the relationship when it was clear she wasn't in love, which is her right. Justin's reaction and her feelings of guilt might indicate she handled it poorly, but that doesn't necessarily make her the asshole. She tried to be supportive, even suggesting friendship. \n\nI think the main issue is whether there was emotional manipulation or exploitation. If she was aware of his feelings and used the situation for financial support without reciprocating emotions, that could be problematic. But if it was a mutual decision to live together and she ended it without strings, then it's a personal choice. \n\nConsidering all that, I believe she's not in the wrong because she ended a relationship where she wasn't in love. However, there might be room for criticism about how the relationship was handled, especially the financial dependency. But in terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's more about intent and respect. If she was honest and didn't lead him on, then she's not wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any exploitation or deceit involved.\n"
