We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up after getting a better job. The author is 29, and the ex-boyfriend is 20 with Asperger's. They met when the author was cleaning his apartment. He bought her things, she moved in with him after losing her job. Then she gets a good job, saves money, and breaks up with him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. Justin is 20, which is still pretty young, and the author is almost 30. That might raise questions about the relationship dynamics. Also, Justin has Asperger's, which can affect how he handles relationships and emotions. The author mentions that Justin bought her things, which could be seen as generous, but also maybe as a way to support her financially when she was struggling. The author was moving in with him because her apartment was bad, and she lost her job. Then she gets a better job, becomes more financially stable, and decides to leave. \n\nThe main question is whether breaking up was wrong. The author didn't love Justin the same way he loved her. She tried to explain things, even suggesting friends with benefits, but he was upset. She feels bad about it. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual feelings. If she didn't have the same level of love and decided to leave when her situation improved, that's her choice. But did she have a responsibility to stay? Maybe not. However, there's the aspect of using him financially. She says she didn't have many expenses with him, implying he was supporting her. Then when she became more stable, she left. Some might see that as taking advantage of his support and then leaving once she's on her own. Others might say she's prioritizing her own well-being and happiness.\n\nAlso, Justin's reaction is intense. He's devastated and doesn't want to be friends with benefits. The author's decision might have been necessary for her own growth, even if it hurt him. But maybe she could have handled it more sensitively. However, the core issue is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. If the relationship was unequal in terms of commitment and love, she's not necessarily the asshole. But if she was in a relationship where he was supporting her financially and she left once she didn't need that anymore, that's a gray area.\n\nI think it's a close call, but leaning towards her not being in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her own needs and circumstances. However, the age difference and potential power imbalance could be factors. But the main point is that she's choosing her own happiness and future, which isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
