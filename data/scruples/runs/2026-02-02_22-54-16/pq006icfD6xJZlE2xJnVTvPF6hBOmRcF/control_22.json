We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is 29, her ex is Justin, 20, and they were dating over a year. She was struggling financially, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, who has Asperger's, started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She lost her cleaning job and his support was a meal ticket. She didn't love him as much as he did. She got a good job, saved up, and broke up with him. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were wrong. The main issue here is the breakup. The author was in a relationship where Justin was providing financial support, but she didn't love him. After securing a better job and financial stability, she ended the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the context: Justin's Asperger's might affect how he communicates or handles emotions, but that's not a justification for the author's actions. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to weigh the relationship dynamics. The author admitted she didn't love him as he did, which is a key point. In a healthy relationship, mutual affection is important. If one person isn't invested emotionally, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the financial aspect complicates things. She relied on his support, and then left once she was stable. \n\nBut wait, was the relationship built on a foundation of care or dependency? The author mentions she was moving in with him because of her circumstances. That could suggest the relationship wasn't balanced. Justin's actions (buying her things) might be seen as caring, but if the author didn't reciprocate those feelings, it's still a problem. The breakup itself is a personal choice. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't feel the same. However, the way she handled it\u2014leaving after gaining financial stability\u2014might make her feel guilty, but isn't that her right? People's lives and circumstances change, and relationships can end for various reasons. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Is there an ethical obligation to stay in a relationship when the person's circumstances improve? Probably not. The key here is the lack of mutual love. The author didn't force Justin to support her; he chose to do so. She made a decision to leave because she didn't have the same feelings. While it's sad for Justin, it's not necessarily wrong on her part. However, some might argue that she took advantage of his support and then left. But if the relationship wasn't based on love from her side, then it's more about personal growth than exploitation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). The author isn't in the wrong for ending a relationship where she didn't have mutual feelings, especially after securing her own financial independence. The breakup is a personal choice, even if it's difficult for the other person.\n"
