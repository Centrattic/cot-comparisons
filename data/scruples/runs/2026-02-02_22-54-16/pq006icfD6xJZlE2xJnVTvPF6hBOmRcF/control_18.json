We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's 29, dating a 20-year-old named Justin who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was buying her things, they moved in together, but she didn't love him. She got a good job, saved money, and then broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Justin is significantly younger and might not have the same life experience. He has Asperger's, which could affect how he processes relationships and emotions. The author was in a situation where she was financially struggling and Justin was supporting her, which might create an imbalance. She moved in with him, but she didn't love him the same way he loved her. \n\nWhen she got a better job, she became more financially stable and decided to leave. The key question is whether she was fair in how she handled the breakup. She tried to console him, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he was angry. Is it wrong to leave a relationship you're not committed to, especially when you've been in it for a year? \n\nFrom one angle, the author had the right to end the relationship if she wasn't in love. People can't be forced to stay in a relationship just because they're financially stable now. However, Justin might have been emotionally invested, and the breakup could be seen as using him for financial support until she could become independent. That might be considered selfish, but it's also a reality that people's priorities change. \n\nThe age difference is significant, which can lead to different life stages and expectations. The author might have been taking advantage of Justin's generosity, but she wasn't in love and felt it was better to leave on her own terms rather than let it go on without real commitment. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She didn't force him into the relationship, and she did try to be honest. However, the fact that she was receiving financial support and then left after securing her own financial stability could make some people think she used him. On the other hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship that isn't fulfilling. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the relationship was based on genuine mutual affection or if there was an implicit understanding that it was casual. The author mentions that she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but didn't because he started loving her. That suggests she wasn't clear about her intentions, which could be a point against her. If she wasn't in love and was leading him on, that might be wrong. But if they were in a relationship without clear definitions, then ending it when she's ready isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be the asshole. People change their minds, and it's better to end things when you realize it's not working. But there's a nuance where not being upfront about her intentions might have contributed to the problem. But overall, the decision to leave because she's now financially stable and doesn't love him isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
