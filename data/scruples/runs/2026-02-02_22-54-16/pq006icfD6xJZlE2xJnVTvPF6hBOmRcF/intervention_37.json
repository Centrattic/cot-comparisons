We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a good job. The author is 29, the ex is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, he was buying her things, and she moved in with him. She ended the relationship after getting a better job, and he's upset.\n\nHmm, first, age difference. 29 and 20 is a 9-year gap. That's not a huge gap, but it might affect dynamics. He's younger, maybe less experienced. He has Asperger's, which might impact how he processes emotions and relationships. She was in a financial situation where she needed his support, but then her circumstances improved. \n\nShe mentions she didn't love him as he did, which is a common reason for breaking up. However, she took advantage of his kindness by moving in with him and relying on his financial support. When she got the job, she could leave. But he was her meal ticket, which might mean the relationship was imbalanced. She broke up and tried to console him, but he's devastated. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. So, is it okay to end a relationship when you have your own financial stability? If the relationship was unequal, maybe she had the right to leave. But she might have been using him for financial support. Also, moving in together quickly and then moving out after getting a job might indicate a lack of commitment from her side.\n\nBut she was clear she didn't love him. He might have been emotionally invested more than she was. Breaking up because you're not in love is generally acceptable. However, the way she handled it\u2014suggesting friends with benefits and then he got angry\u2014maybe she could have been more considerate. \n\nStill, in terms of being in the wrong, if the relationship was based on unequal commitment and she left once her situation improved, it's not necessarily her fault. People can have different levels of commitment. But maybe she should have been more upfront about her feelings earlier. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what she could have done better. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
