We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The story is from Reddit's Am I the Asshole (AITA) subreddit, so it's a typical question where people come to get opinions on whether they did something wrong.\n\nThe woman (let's call her the author) is 29, her boyfriend Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Aspergers, was awkward initially but then they started dating. She admits she took his virginity, and they had a casual start. She was planning to tell him it was strictly casual, but he started investing in her\u2014buying groceries, clothes, a winter coat, and she moved in with him. She lost her cleaning job and was dependent on him financially. However, she didn't love him as much as he did. Now, she got a better paying job, saved money, broke up with him, and he's upset. The author feels bad but thinks she's not the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The relationship had a power imbalance in terms of money. Justin was providing for her financially when she was in a lower-income situation. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. Then she got a better job, became financially independent, and ended the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up when she gained stability.\n\nThe user says they think the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a financial dependency, if one partner is the sole provider, and the other becomes independent, it can cause tension. If the relationship was based on that dependency, and the dependent partner gains independence, it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship, especially if there was a lack of mutual love or commitment. The author mentions she didn't love Justin like he did. That's a key point\u2014lack of reciprocal feelings. Also, Justin's age (20) and her age (29) might be a factor, but it's not illegal. The fact that he has Aspergers might affect his ability to understand the relationship dynamics, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she led him on, especially since he was investing emotionally and financially. She took his virginity, moved in with him, but didn't have feelings for him. But from her perspective, she was honest when she planned to tell him it was casual, though he didn't agree. She tried to maintain a friends-with-benefits arrangement after the breakup, which he rejected. So she tried to offer alternatives but he was upset either way.\n\nIn terms of ethics, ending a relationship because of personal growth and independence isn't typically seen as wrong. The main issue is if she was deceptive. She wasn't hiding her feelings; she just had different feelings than he did. Also, financial dependency can create an imbalanced relationship, and when that changes, it's natural for the relationship to end if there's no emotional connection. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The key factors are her lack of love, his financial support being a factor in their relationship dynamics, and her becoming independent. Breaking up for personal growth and because of mismatched feelings isn't wrong. The Aspergers aspect might make him more vulnerable, but that's not the author's fault if he didn't recognize his own feelings or the situation properly.\n"
