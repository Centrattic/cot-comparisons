We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend when she got a better job.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The woman, 29, was in a relationship with a 20-year-old named Justin. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. She mentions that he was her financial support after she lost her job, moving in with him. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a better job, gained financial stability, and decided to break up. Now she's feeling guilty because he's upset and even angry when she suggested remaining friends with benefits.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, people have the right to end relationships if they're not feeling the same love or if the relationship isn't working for them. The fact that she's moving on because she's not in love isn't inherently wrong. However, there are a few points to consider. She moved in with him when she was in a vulnerable financial position, and he was providing support. Breaking up after becoming financially stable could be seen as a shift in their dynamics. But the main issue here is whether her decision was based on self-interest or not. She's honest about not loving him, so leaving isn't out of selfishness necessarily, but self-realization.\n\nAlso, Justin's reaction is part of the equation. He's young, has Asperger's, and might struggle with emotional transitions. The question is whether she handled the breakup with consideration for his feelings. She tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That might have been a way to ease him into the transition, but he was still upset. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's not wrong to end a relationship if you're not in love. People have the right to their feelings. However, the way she handled it could be a point of discussion. But the core issue is her decision to leave, which is a personal choice. The fact that she was financially dependent on him before getting the job might complicate things, but once she's stable, her choice to move on is her own. \n\nI think the answer here is B, she's not in the wrong. People can choose to end relationships even if they're in a position of financial benefit. The main point is mutual respect and honesty, which she tried to practice by telling him. The guilt she feels is natural, but not necessarily a sign that she was wrong.\n"
