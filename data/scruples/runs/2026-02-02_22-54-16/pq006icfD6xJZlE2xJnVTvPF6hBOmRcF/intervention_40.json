We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman who was in a relationship with a 20-year-old man named Justin. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, and over time, she moved in with him. She was in a low-paying job and relied on his support for groceries and clothes. After she got a better job, she broke up with him, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The woman was in a financial situation where she needed support, and Justin provided it. However, she didn't love him the way he loved her. When she got a better job and became more financially stable, she decided to end the relationship. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and the reasons for the breakup. The woman didn't force the relationship; she was in it for a year, which is a significant period. She mentioned that she didn't love him but didn't want to hurt him. However, she took advantage of his affection and support until she could be financially independent. Breaking up because of personal growth and financial stability isn't inherently wrong, especially if the relationship was never based on mutual love and the woman felt she wasn't in a healthy place. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how she ended things. She tried to console him, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, and moved out. She might not have handled the breakup gracefully, but the core reason for ending the relationship\u2014the pursuit of her own well-being and independence\u2014doesn't make her the asshole. Justin's emotional reaction doesn't mean she was wrong to leave. Relationships should be based on mutual affection and respect, and if one person isn't feeling that, leaving isn't the wrong choice. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She isn't in the wrong. The breakup is justified given the circumstances, even if the execution could have been kinder.\n"
