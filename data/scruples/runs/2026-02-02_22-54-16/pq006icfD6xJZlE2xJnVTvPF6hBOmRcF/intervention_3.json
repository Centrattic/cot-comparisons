We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex is 20 and has Asperger's. They were dating for over a year. She was in a lower-income situation, doing odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, being in a better financial position, helped her out with groceries, clothes, and they even moved in together. She mentions she didn't love him like he did. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation. She tried being friends with benefits, but he was angry. She's feeling guilty now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The age difference is 9 years, which might be a factor, but not necessarily a problem. Justin's Asperger's could affect his understanding of relationships or emotional cues. The author was in a financial bind, relying on Justin for support, but then got a better job. She decided to end the relationship, perhaps realizing it's not a long-term fit since she doesn't love him. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she was in a situation where she wasn't in love, and now that she's more stable, she feels it's time to move on. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. Did she treat Justin with respect? She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That might show she attempted to mitigate his feelings, but he was upset regardless. \n\nShe did move in with him, which implies some level of commitment. However, she states she wasn't in love. Relationships require mutual affection; if one person doesn't feel the same, it's reasonable to end it. The fact that she had financial dependencies might have complicated things. Once she's financially independent, the dynamic changes. \n\nIs it fair for her to leave after receiving support? Not necessarily, because relationships are built on mutual affection, not just financial stability. If she wasn't emotionally invested, staying might not be fair to him. Justin was investing emotionally and financially, but she wasn't returning the emotional investment. Ending it could be the right move for her, even if it's painful for him.\n\nHowever, the way she ended the relationship and the aftermath matter. She tried to console him, so she might be trying to be respectful. The friends-with-benefits idea might have been a misstep if he was hoping for a longer relationship. But overall, she's choosing her own happiness and reality, which is valid. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's subjective. The author isn't malicious; she's making a decision based on her feelings and circumstances. Justin's reaction is unfortunate, but she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where the feelings aren't mutual. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
