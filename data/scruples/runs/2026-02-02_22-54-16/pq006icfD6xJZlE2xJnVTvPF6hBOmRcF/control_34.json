We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job.\n\nFirst, looking at the ages: the author is 29, and Justin is 20. There's an 9-year age gap, which might be a point of consideration. However, age gaps alone don't determine right or wrong in relationships. \n\nThe author mentions that they met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, while Justin lived in a luxury condo. They started a relationship, and she moved in with him after losing her job. Justin provided financial support, buying her groceries and clothes. She admits she doesn't love him as he does and broke up when she got a better-paying job.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The relationship might have been imbalanced. Justin took on a financial provider role, while the author was in a more vulnerable economic position initially. \n2. The breakup was due to the author's career advancement, which is a valid reason for someone to reassess their relationship. \n3. The author tried to maintain a friendship/benefits after the breakup, which Justin rejected. \n\nEmotional factors: The author feels bad about Justin's reaction. Justin is described as having Asperger's, which might affect how he processes the breakup. However, that doesn't make the author wrong; people with Asperger's still have to navigate emotional situations.\n\nEthically, people have the right to pursue better opportunities. The author wasn't forced into the relationship and chose to leave when her circumstances improved. Justin's actions (buying her things, financial support) might have been generous, but if the author didn't reciprocate the emotional investment, staying in the relationship would be unfair to both.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: She might have relied on Justin financially, and leaving when things improved could be seen as opportunistic. However, she didn't stay in the relationship out of obligation; she chose to move on when her situation changed, which is her right.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's empathy for Justin's feelings, the author's decision to prioritize her own well-being and independence doesn't make her the asshole. Relationships require mutual feelings, and the author wasn't in love. So, the answer would be B.\n"
