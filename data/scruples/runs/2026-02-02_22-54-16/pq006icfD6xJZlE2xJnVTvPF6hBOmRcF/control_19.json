We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments where she met Justin. He lives in a luxury condo, and they started a relationship. She mentions that Justin has Asperger's and was initially awkward but was a sweetheart. They had sex, and he became her \"meal ticket\" after she lost her job. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. Then she got a better job, saved up money, broke up with him, moved out, and now feels bad. The question is whether she's the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was in a financial situation where she needed support, and Justin provided it. They had a relationship that might not have been on equal footing financially. The author didn't love him but was with him, possibly taking advantage of his resources. Then she leaves after securing a better job, which gives her financial independence. She tried to offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which Justin rejected. Now she's questioning if she did the wrong thing.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships require some level of mutual emotional investment. The author admits she doesn't love him but was with him for support. That could be seen as using him, which is ethically questionable. However, she ended the relationship when she became financially stable, which might suggest she wanted to leave on her own terms rather than continuing a potentially unequal relationship. Justin, being 20, might be emotionally immature, and the age gap could affect the dynamics. Also, his reaction (being devastated and angry) indicates he was emotionally invested, while the author wasn't.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up after gaining financial independence is wrong. On one hand, ending a relationship because you no longer need the other person's support could be seen as self-serving. But if the relationship wasn't genuine to begin with, leaving might be the right choice. The author also tried to console him and offered a different arrangement, which shows she considered his feelings, even if he was upset.\n\nHowever, the fact that she moved in with him and relied on his financial support while not being in love could be seen as manipulative. Breaking up after securing her own financial future might just be her taking control of her life, but the initial relationship might have been based on his generosity and her emotional detachment.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the wrong for not being honest about her feelings earlier and using Justin for financial support. On the other hand, she's now taking steps to improve her life and left when she could. The answer depends on whether the relationship was based on genuine emotional connection or just financial need. Since she didn't love him and was using him, that's a problem. But she also ended it when she was in a better position, which could be seen as fair. Maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she wasn't honest and used him, but also B (she's not in the wrong) because she's now independent and left on her terms. I need to decide which aspect is more significant.\n"
