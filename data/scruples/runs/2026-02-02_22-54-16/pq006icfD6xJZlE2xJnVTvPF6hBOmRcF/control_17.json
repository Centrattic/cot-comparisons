We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job. They had been dating over a year, and she was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. The boyfriend has Asperger's, and she ended up moving in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him as much, and when she got a good job, she broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on Justin for a time, but that changed when she got a better job. She moved in with him after her apartment was crumbling. The age difference is significant\u2014she's 29, he's 20. He's described as emotionally invested, giving her gifts, and she's not reciprocating love. When she breaks up, he's devastated. She tried to console him and even suggested staying friends with benefits, which he rejected.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship ethics standpoint, people can end relationships for any reason, especially if they're not feeling the mutual love. Justin's emotional investment doesn't obligate her to stay if she doesn't love him. However, financial dependence might complicate things. If she left without ensuring his well-being, maybe she should have considered that. But she did move out and he's an adult, so perhaps that's his responsibility. The age gap is also a factor; a 20-year-old is still young, and a 29-year-old ending the relationship might be seen as moving on, which is normal. However, the situation where he's buying her things and she's using his financial support could imply some form of transactional relationship, but she later gains her own financial stability. Her decision to break up after gaining independence seems more about her own needs. The key here is whether her actions were selfish or self-determined. Since she was in a position where she was not in love and then became financially stable, leaving to pursue her own life isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to end relationships that aren't fulfilling. The fact that he's upset is natural, but she's not obligated to stay in a relationship without mutual feelings. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance about the power dynamic if she was using his money, but she clarifies that she was moving out and he's an adult. Also, moving in with him when she was in a bad apartment might have created a dependent situation, but she's taking charge of her life now. So, overall, her decision to prioritize her own well-being and independence isn't wrong. The answer is B.\n"
