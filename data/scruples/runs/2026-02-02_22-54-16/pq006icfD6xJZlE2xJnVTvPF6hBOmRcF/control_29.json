We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author is 29, her ex Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. The author was struggling financially, working odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, has Asperger's, and was her meal ticket after she lost her job. She moved in with him, he bought her things. She didn't love him back. Recently, she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she feels bad about it. The question is if she's an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference (nine years), the financial dependency, and the emotional dynamics. Justin was providing financially when she was in a tough spot, and she moved in with him. However, she didn't love him and ended the relationship when her financial situation improved.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, relationships should be based on mutual respect and love. If the author felt that the relationship wasn't right for her and she was using Justin for financial support, that could be problematic. However, she broke up when she gained financial independence, which could be seen as her taking control of her life. On the other hand, leaving someone who was emotionally invested, especially someone with Asperger's, might have caused him distress, but she wasn't in love with him.\n\nThe age difference might not be the main issue unless there's a power imbalance. Justin was the one providing financially when she was in need, so maybe there's a dependency issue. But she broke up when she could support herself. \n\nIn some perspectives, ending a relationship because you've gained stability and don't have feelings is understandable. However, if the relationship was unequal from the start (financial dependency) and she didn't reciprocate feelings, maybe it's justified. But if she stayed in the relationship just for financial reasons, that's a problem. The fact that she didn't love him and ended it when she could might make her not the asshole. However, some might argue that she should have been honest about her lack of love earlier instead of staying for the financial support.\n\nBut the main point is she broke up when her circumstances changed. If she's not in love and the relationship was imbalanced, then ending it could be reasonable. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
