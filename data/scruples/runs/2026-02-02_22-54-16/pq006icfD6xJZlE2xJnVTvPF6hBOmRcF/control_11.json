We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age gap\u2014she's 29, he's 20. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Initially, she was in a lower-income situation, and he provided financial support. She moved in with him, but she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him because she didn't feel the same love.\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. That's not insubstantial, but it's not unheard of either. The key here is the power dynamic. She was in a lower socioeconomic position, and he was providing financial support. She mentions he bought her groceries, clothes, a coat, and she moved in with him. That seems like a significant financial contribution. However, she also states she didn't love him, which is a key factor in relationships.\n\nShe broke up with him after securing a better job. She felt she didn't owe him her love and chose to move on. The question is whether this makes her the asshole. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given options.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, breaking up because you no longer want to be in the relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the circumstances matter. If she was in a dependent position and then left once her financial situation improved, some might see it as taking advantage. But others might argue that she's prioritizing her own needs and happiness, which is valid.\n\nThe fact that she tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement suggests she cares about his feelings. However, he was devastated, and she still feels bad. This indicates she might have a conscience about it.\n\nAnother angle is the initial dynamic. She took his virginity and the relationship started as casual, but he became more attached. She didn't set boundaries early on, which might have led to his attachment. Now, when she leaves, it's abrupt. Was she honest about her feelings earlier? If she was leading him on without intending to commit, that could be a problem. But the story says she didn't love him, so maybe she didn't realize the depth of his feelings until later.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, people have the right to leave relationships if they're not working. However, if there's a significant reliance on financial support, there might be an expectation of more commitment. But since it's a romantic relationship, not a financial agreement, her main duty is to her own well-being. \n\nThe key points here are consent, honesty, and mutual expectations. If she didn't make him aware of her feelings earlier and he invested emotionally, that's a valid point. But once she realizes she doesn't love him, it's reasonable to end the relationship. The fact that she had to move out shows she's taking steps to separate, which is necessary for her growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements where she could have been more upfront, the act of breaking up because she no longer wants the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the situation is nuanced. The answer should consider whether she's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that people can have different perspectives, but the core issue is her right to leave a relationship she's not happy in, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
