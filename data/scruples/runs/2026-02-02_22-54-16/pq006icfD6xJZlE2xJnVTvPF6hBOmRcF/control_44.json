We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend Justin after getting a good job. They had a relationship where he was providing her with things like groceries, clothes, and a place to live. She didn't love him as much as he did, and when she got a better job, she left. He's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She was in a relationship where Justin was taking care of her financially. She admits she didn't love him as much as he loved her. When she got a better job and became more financially stable, she decided to end the relationship. The question is whether that makes her the asshole.\n\nIn relationships, mutual feelings and commitment are important. If she was only interested in him for his financial support and didn't have genuine feelings, that could be seen as using him. However, she mentions she felt bad after breaking up, so maybe she had some emotional attachment. Also, she offered to stay as friends with benefits, which Justin rejected. \n\nBut the main issue is her lack of reciprocal love. If a person is in a relationship without loving their partner and leaves when they become financially independent, that might be seen as self-serving. However, it's also her right to leave a relationship that isn't fulfilling for her. The problem might be how the breakup was handled and the reasons behind it. \n\nJustin's age (20 vs her 29) could be a factor. Maybe he was emotionally immature, and she was taking advantage of that. But the question is about her being in the wrong. She wasn't forced to stay; she left when her circumstances changed. However, the fact that she moved in with him and relied on him financially when she wasn't working might complicate things. People can leave relationships for various reasons, including personal growth and better opportunities, but if the primary motivation was financial gain and then leaving once that's no longer needed, that's questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't force him into the relationship. He chose to be with her despite her initial intention to keep it casual. She might have led him on, but if she was clear from the start about her intentions, it's different. The story says she intended to make it casual but he fell in love, which complicates things. If she didn't reciprocate his feelings, maybe she should have ended it earlier rather than staying once she had his support. \n\nIn summary, she may have been in a situation where she wasn't fully committed, stayed for his support, and left when she no longer needed it. That could be seen as selfish, leading to her being the asshole. However, the alternative is that she was honest about her intentions and left when her situation changed, which is valid. The answer might depend on whether she was upfront about her lack of feelings from the beginning. If she let him believe there was more commitment than there was, that's where the problem is. The answer could be A (she's in the wrong) because she may have led him on without genuine feelings and left when it suited her.\n"
