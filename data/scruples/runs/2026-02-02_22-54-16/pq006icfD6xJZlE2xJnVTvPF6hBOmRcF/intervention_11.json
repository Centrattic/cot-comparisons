We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after getting a good job is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29 and her ex is 20. They were together for a little over a year. She was struggling financially, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional understanding. She mentions she took his virginity and they had a sexual relationship. She even moved in with him because her apartment was bad, and after losing her cleaning job, she was relying on him financially. She didn't love him as he did. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong. I need to decide if she is. Let's break it down. She was in a relationship where there was a significant age gap and possibly a power imbalance. She was financially dependent on him at one point, which could complicate things. But then she got a better job, became more independent, and ended the relationship. She tried to be kind, offered to stay friends with benefits, but he was upset. \n\nIs it wrong to leave a relationship when you're no longer dependent and don't have feelings? Well, people have the right to pursue their happiness and financial stability. However, the fact that she was financially reliant on him earlier might raise questions about the relationship's health. But since she's now independent, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. Also, if she never loved him, it's not a betrayal of love but more of a realization of her own feelings. \n\nJustin's reaction is also a factor. He has Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to cope with the breakup. But that doesn't mean she's wrong for leaving. People can't be responsible for their partners' emotional states beyond being kind. \n\nThe key points are: she was in a relationship where she didn't love him as he did, became independent, and ended it. There's no indication of manipulation or deceit. She tried to be supportive in the breakup. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
