We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a significant age gap, different financial backgrounds, and the boyfriend's Asperger's diagnosis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is 29, and her boyfriend is 20. She was struggling financially, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, being from a more affluent background, provided her with financial support\u2014groceries, clothes, a coat, and even helped her move into his place. She mentions she didn't love him the way he loved her. Then she got a better job, became more financially stable, and decided to break up. \n\nThe key points here are the power dynamics in the relationship. Justin was providing financial support, and she was relying on it. When she became more financially independent, she ended the relationship. It's possible that Justin was emotionally invested and didn't see it as a transactional relationship. The question is whether leaving because of financial stability is justified, especially if the emotional connection wasn't mutual. \n\nSome might argue that she was using him financially, and once she could support herself, she left. Others might say she had the right to pursue her own financial independence and that staying in a relationship without mutual love is not healthy. \n\nHer decision to break up isn't because she's avoiding commitment but because she's gaining independence. However, breaking up after building up a life together could be seen as abrupt, especially if Justin was emotionally attached. The fact that she tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows she considered his feelings. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since she didn't love him and he was the one with strong feelings, ending the relationship when she's more stable might be seen as her right. Age and financial dynamics can complicate relationships, and her choice to prioritize her independence is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
