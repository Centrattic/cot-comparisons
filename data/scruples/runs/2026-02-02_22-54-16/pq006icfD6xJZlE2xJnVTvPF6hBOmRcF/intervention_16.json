We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman and her 20-year-old boyfriend, Justin. They were together for over a year, she was in a tough financial situation, moved in with him, and he supported her financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her, and after getting a better job, she broke up with him.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant\u201418 years. Justin is 20, which is still quite young for a committed relationship. Relationships with such a large age gap can sometimes lead to power imbalances or differing life stages. The woman was in a bad financial position, moving in with him because her apartment was crumbling. He provided financial support, which might have created a dependency. She mentions she didn't love him but stayed because of the financial support. That's a red flag\u2014if the relationship wasn't based on mutual love but more on financial stability, it's a shaky foundation.\n\nThen, when she got a good job, she felt empowered to leave. Breaking up when one is in a better position isn't inherently wrong. She tried to console him and even offered to be friends with benefits, but he was upset. The question is whether she's at fault for ending a relationship where she didn't have feelings and was using him for support. Also, Justin might have had his own issues with Asperger's, which can affect communication and emotional understanding.\n\nBut the woman's actions were based on her own needs and growth. She wasn't in love, and once her circumstances improved, she chose to leave. That seems self-respecting. However, the way she handled the breakup might be questionable. She moved out, which is natural after breaking up, but the fact that he's devastated and she feels bad could indicate she didn't handle it carefully. However, the core issue is her decision to leave, which in a relationship that wasn't based on love from her side isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. She prioritized her own well-being and growth after being in a situation where she wasn't in love. The relationship's foundation was unstable, and breaking up when possible is a responsible choice.\n"
