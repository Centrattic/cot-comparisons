We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation involves a significant age gap and differing life circumstances. The woman is 29, and the boyfriend is 20. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a lower income situation, and he was more financially stable. They started dating, she moved in with him after losing her job, and he provided financial support. However, she didn't love him the way he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the power dynamics. There's a financial disparity where he was supporting her financially. That could create an imbalance. However, she wasn't forced into the relationship; she chose to be with him. The age difference might mean different life stages. At 20, he's likely in a different phase than she is at 29. \n\nThe user mentioned that she tried to be friends with benefits but he was angry. She moved out and feels bad. She's questioning if she's the asshole. \n\nI should think about intentions. She didn't start the relationship as a \"friends with benefits\" situation but then tried to transition to that after breaking up. That could be confusing. However, the main reason for the breakup is her getting a better job and feeling they aren't in love. She had the right to leave a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual affection. If she wasn't in love and he was, then it's a one-sided dynamic. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship without love. The fact that she broke up after securing her financial stability might be seen as self-serving, but it's not necessarily wrong. People change and grow, especially with career progression. \n\nHowever, there's a part where she moved in with him after losing her job, implying she was dependent on his support. Then when she became financially independent, she left. That could be seen as using him for financial support. But she didn't start the relationship with that intent. She was in a tough spot and he helped her. \n\nThe key here is whether the breakup was justified. Since she didn't love him and he was in love, the breakup isn't inherently wrong. She had the right to leave. The age difference might also play a role in maturity levels. At 20, he might be more emotionally attached and not handle the breakup well. But that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). She had the right to leave a relationship where she wasn't in love, even if it caused him pain. The situation involves personal growth and changing circumstances. While it's unfortunate for him, she's not the asshole for prioritizing her own needs and moving on.\n"
