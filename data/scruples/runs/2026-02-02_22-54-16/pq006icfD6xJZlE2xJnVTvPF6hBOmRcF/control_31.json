We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The main question is whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user (let's call her the author) is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They dated for over a year. She had been in a lower-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, indicating he's more financially stable. She mentions moving in with him because her apartment was crumbling, and she lost her job, relying on him for groceries and a coat. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author was in a relationship where there was a significant age difference (she's 29, he's 20). She initially considered the relationship casual but he developed deeper feelings. She moved in with him, which implies a level of commitment. She was financially dependent on him for a period, then became more stable. When she got a better job, she decided to break up, possibly because she didn't love him as much as he loved her. Now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships should be based on mutual feelings. If she didn't love him but he did, continuing the relationship might be seen as unfair. However, breaking up when she gained financial independence could be seen as self-serving. But there's also the aspect of her initial intentions\u2014she was going to make it casual, but he took it further. She had moved in with him, which might have given him the impression of a more serious relationship. \n\nJustin's age is 20, which is young, and he has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. The author might have taken advantage of his naivety or inability to set boundaries. However, she did try to console him and even suggested staying friends with benefits, which he rejected. \n\nThe author's actions in breaking up after becoming financially stable could be seen as prioritizing her own needs, which is reasonable. However, the way she ended the relationship and the fact that he was devastated might make her feel responsible. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios often consider intentions and fairness. The author's main issue was not loving Justin, so ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. The problem could be if she kept the relationship going under false pretenses. If she was clear about her feelings from the start, then it's less her fault. However, if she led him on without being honest, that would be an issue.\n\nFinancial dependency complicates things. He was supporting her financially, and when she became independent, she left. It's possible he felt betrayed because he invested in the relationship. But she had the right to pursue better opportunities. The age gap and his Asperger's might mean he's less experienced, and she might have a responsibility to ensure he's not being taken advantage of. However, if the relationship was consensual and she didn't pressure him, it's her choice.\n\nIn summary, the author had a relationship where she didn't reciprocate the same level of love. She broke up when her circumstances improved. While it's understandable to feel guilty, especially if Justin was emotionally vulnerable, the decision to end a relationship where her feelings aren't mutual isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether she was honest about her intentions from the beginning. If she was upfront, then she's not in the wrong. If she was leading him on, then it's more complicated. The information given suggests she was initially going to keep it casual, so maybe she's not at fault.\n"
