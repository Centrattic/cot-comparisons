We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is 29, her ex is Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a tough financial situation, moving in with him because her apartment was bad. Justin was providing her with groceries, clothes, and a winter coat. She moved in with him and lost her cleaning job, relying on him a bit. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. Justin is upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Justin is significantly younger, has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. The author was in a financially unstable position when they started dating, which might have created a power imbalance. Justin was supporting her financially, and she moved in with him. Then, once she became more financially stable, she ended the relationship.\n\nFrom one angle, she might have felt trapped or used, especially if she didn't love him and was relying on him for support. Ending the relationship when she's in a better position could be seen as her taking control of her life. However, there's a question of whether she exploited Justin's feelings or his condition. Since he's 20 and she's almost 30, there's an age gap, and she was the one in a vulnerable financial state initially. That could imply a more mature person taking advantage of a younger, possibly less experienced person.\n\nBut on the other hand, she's making a choice based on her own needs and growth. She got a good job, which is a positive step, and maybe the relationship wasn't healthy from the start. The fact that she tried to explain and even offered to be friends with benefits shows she tried to handle it with some consideration.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether she was in the wrong. The Asperger's aspect might mean Justin didn't fully understand the relationship's boundaries or the implications of supporting her financially. If the author was using him for financial support while not having feelings for him, that could be seen as manipulative. But if she genuinely had feelings at some point and the relationship was a mutual support system, then breaking up when she's able to stand on her own isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the age difference and the power dynamic are important. Justin might have been more emotionally invested, and the author ending things when she's financially stable could be fair. It's about whether the relationship was based on mutual respect or if there was an imbalance. If she was using him for financial support without reciprocating emotionally, that's an issue. But if the relationship was based on mutual affection and she's now choosing to move on for her own growth, that's different.\n\nIn conclusion, while Justin might be upset, the author's decision to prioritize her own life and independence after securing a better position isn't inherently wrong. The situation has elements that could be criticized, but the core issue is her right to make a choice that benefits her future. So the answer would be B, she's not the asshole.\n"
