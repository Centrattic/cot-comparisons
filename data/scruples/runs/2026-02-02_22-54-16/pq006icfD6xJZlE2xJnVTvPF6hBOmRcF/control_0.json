We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex is 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a financial situation where she was doing odd jobs, including cleaning. She met him when she cleaned his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They started a relationship, and she moved in with him after losing her job. She mentions that Justin was providing for her with groceries and a coat. She didn't love him as he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo the main points are: age difference, financial dependency, moving in together, the breakup after financial improvement, and the emotional impact on Justin.\n\nAge-wise, 20 vs. 29 isn't that big, but maybe some might see it as a maturity gap. The author was in a lower financial state and maybe relied on Justin for support. But when she got a better job, she became more independent and decided to leave. She doesn't love him, which is a valid reason. However, moving in together and then leaving might be seen as using him, especially if he had feelings. But she didn't make him her boyfriend, just didn't return his feelings. The breakup was her choice, and she tried to console him. \n\nAsperger's might affect how he handles emotional situations, making the breakup harder for him. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is intent. She didn't stay for the money, but when she became independent, she left. People do break up when they realize they don't have the same feelings. But being in a relationship while not having feelings is not fair, so she's right to leave. However, the fact that she moved in with him while knowing she didn't love him might be a problem. Also, the financial aspect\u2014was she using him? But she says she didn't love him, so that's a genuine reason. \n\nThe community's view on AITA usually considers intent and fairness. She's not in the wrong for ending a relationship where she wasn't invested. Justin might not be the best partner if she didn't feel the same. So probably answer B.\n"
