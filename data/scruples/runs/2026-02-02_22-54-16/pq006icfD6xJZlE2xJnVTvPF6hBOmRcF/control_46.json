We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a 9-year gap. He's 20 when she moves in with him, which might be seen as a power dynamic. She mentions he's on the autism spectrum, which could affect his understanding of relationships.\n\nShe met him through a job, which was cleaning his apartment. She became his primary emotional support, and he provided financial support after she lost her job. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad. So their relationship is built on her financial need and his emotional/financial support. There's an imbalance here.\n\nShe doesn't love him but was considering making it casual. However, he started treating her like a partner, giving her gifts, and she moved in with him. Then she got a good job, became financially stable, and broke up with him. He's upset and angry, but she tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits situation, which he rejected.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points are consent, communication, and manipulation. Did she take advantage of him? She was in a vulnerable position financially, he was younger and maybe not as emotionally mature. She took his virginity, which might imply a lack of clear boundaries. Then, when her circumstances improved, she ended the relationship. Even though she didn't love him, she should have communicated her feelings earlier. Ending the relationship because of financial stability isn't unethical, but the way she handled it\u2014moving in, accepting financial support, then leaving after becoming stable\u2014could be seen as exploiting him. However, she did try to be considerate after breaking up. The community might see it as her right to leave once she's stable, especially if the relationship wasn't equal. But the age gap and possible manipulation might tip the scales. So the answer could be A (she's in the wrong) because of the power dynamics and not being honest about her feelings earlier.\n"
