Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a heterosexual man being repeatedly questioned by his bisexual girlfriend about his sexuality. The man is frustrated that even after he's told her he's straight, she keeps asking, even going as far as checking his porn history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly despite giving clear answers. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bisexual, and he's in a heterosexual relationship. He's also mentioned that he's comfortable with his sexuality and doesn't mind people asking, but the constant questioning is annoying him. The girlfriend's friend might have suggested the idea that he's gay, leading to her continued doubts.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's side: maybe she's insecure? Being in a relationship with a bisexual partner might make her have some fears or uncertainties. Her friend's influence could have planted the seed of doubt. It's possible she's not respecting his boundaries by checking his private history without consent. But then again, she's expressing her own insecurities by questioning him multiple times. However, respecting someone's sexuality and their comfort in stating it is important. If he's clearly stated he's straight and she's not taking it at face value, that could indicate a lack of trust or understanding on her part.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author has the right to his sexuality, and it's his prerogative to define it. Repeatedly questioning someone after they've given a clear answer can be seen as invalidating their identity. Also, checking his private history without permission is a boundary violation. That part is definitely not okay. \n\nFrom a societal standpoint, the author is right to feel frustrated. It's 2019, and while some people may still struggle with LGBTQ+ issues, the fact that the author is heterosexual and the girlfriend is bisexual might create a dynamic where the author's sexuality isn't questioned as much as someone in the LGBTQ+ community. But in this case, it's the opposite; the author is heterosexual but is being asked repeatedly. The girlfriend's actions could stem from insecurity rather than malice, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is dealing with her own issues related to her bisexuality or past experiences. But regardless of her reasons, she should respect his boundaries and his self-identified sexuality. The fact that she's not taking him at his word suggests a lack of trust, which is a problem in the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being asked repeatedly and for pointing out the hypocrisy, especially since his girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are disrespectful and invasive, and the author is justified in his frustration. The answer should be B.\n"
