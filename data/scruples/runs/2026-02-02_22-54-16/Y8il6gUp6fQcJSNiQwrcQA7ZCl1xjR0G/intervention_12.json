Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The situation is that the author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. She got the idea he might be gay because he was nervous during sex initially, and she talked to a friend who suggested he might be gay. The girlfriend asked multiple times, even checked his porn history, and the author got annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality in the past, but he's fine with being asked. However, the girlfriend's repeated questioning and actions (like checking his porn history) are causing him frustration. He feels like he's being made to defend his sexuality, and it's not taken seriously even though he's stated he's straight. He's upset that his girlfriend isn't respecting his answer, especially since she's bi, which he thinks should make her more understanding.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The girlfriend's behavior is based on a concern or doubt about his sexuality. She might be trying to understand his sexual orientation, but her approach is causing conflict. The author's frustration is valid because he's being asked repeatedly despite stating his sexuality. The act of checking his porn history is an invasion of privacy and could be seen as distrustful. The author's anger at being questioned again is a reasonable reaction to the repeated questioning and lack of trust.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her reasons for being insecure or curious, especially since they're in a relationship. But the way she's handling it\u2014repeated questioning and invasion of privacy\u2014is problematic. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being upset; he's entitled to privacy and to not be doubted about his sexuality once he's stated it clearly. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's frustration.\n\nAlso, considering the context of 2019, the author's expectation that his sexuality should be accepted without repeated questioning makes sense. The fact that the girlfriend is bi but still doesn't take his straightness seriously could imply a lack of mutual respect. The author's anger is a response to her not respecting his boundaries and his identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His frustration is justified given the circumstances. The real issue lies with the girlfriend's actions and her lack of trust, not the author's anger towards her.\n"
