Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend who keeps questioning his sexuality. The key points are: the author has been asked before if he's gay and usually doesn't mind, but in this case, the girlfriend's repeated questioning is making him annoyed. She even checked his porn history, which he finds intrusive. He mentions that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now and feels it's hypocritical since she's bi and he should be taken at his word.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is in a committed relationship, and his girlfriend is doubting his sexuality despite him stating it clearly. Repeated questioning can be a sign of not trusting the person's self-identification. The girlfriend's actions, like checking porn history, might be a breach of privacy. The author is frustrated that his identity is being challenged, especially in a context where he's in a relationship with a bi woman. \n\nNow, considering that the author is not in the LGBTQ+ community himself, he might not fully understand the challenges others face. But in this case, he's stating his sexual orientation, and the girlfriend isn't respecting that. The girlfriend's friend might have influenced her, leading to unnecessary doubt. The author's annoyance is justified given the repeated questions and the intrusive behavior. However, I should also think about potential cultural or personal factors. Maybe the girlfriend has had past experiences where people lied about their sexuality, leading her to be more cautious. But in a trusting relationship, especially with someone who's bi, constant questioning could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe post is from 2019, so it's a bit old, but the core issue of respecting someone's stated identity remains relevant. The author isn't the one in the wrong here because he's being honest, and his frustration comes from being doubted. The girlfriend's actions are more problematic as they involve distrust and invasion of privacy. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
