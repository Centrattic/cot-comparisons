Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. She started questioning him after an initial period of nervousness during sex, and even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his straightness, especially since his girlfriend is bi, and he thinks they should be past such issues in 2019.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior of repeatedly questioning his sexuality and invading his privacy by checking his porn history is definitely problematic. That's a breach of trust and respect. The author has a right to feel hurt or annoyed by that. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at her.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her reasons. If she's bisexual, maybe she's more aware of others' sexual orientations and is trying to understand her partner's. But even so, repeatedly questioning and prying into his private data isn't healthy. The author has a right to set boundaries. The fact that he's had to explain his sexuality multiple times is valid. The girlfriend's behavior seems to lack trust, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's okay with people thinking he's gay because of his vibe, but being questioned constantly is tiresome. It's reasonable for him to want his self-identification respected without needing proof. The girlfriend's actions, like checking the porn history, are invasive and disrespectful regardless of her intentions.\n\nSo, the author's frustration is justified. He's not in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy invaded. The key issue is the girlfriend's lack of trust and respect, not the author's feelings about his own sexuality. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
