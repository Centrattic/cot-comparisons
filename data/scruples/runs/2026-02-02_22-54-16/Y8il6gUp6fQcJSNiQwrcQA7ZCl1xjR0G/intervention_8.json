Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The situation involves the girlfriend suspecting he's gay after some initial nervousness during sex, which she then discusses with a friend. The author feels it's frustrating that his identity as straight isn't respected, especially since his girlfriend is bi.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heterosexual and has been clear about his orientation. The girlfriend, despite being bi, is doubting his sexuality. The author is upset because he feels he has to defend his identity repeatedly, which is tiring and disrespectful. \n\nNow, from a social perspective, it's important to respect someone's self-identified sexuality. If someone states their orientation, others should generally accept that unless there's a valid reason to question it, like a history of conflicting statements. In this case, the author has been consistent in saying he's straight. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014could be seen as invasive and not trusting. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her reasons. Maybe she's concerned about the initial sexual performance anxiety. But that's a common issue and doesn't necessarily indicate sexual orientation. Repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality without evidence can lead to tension and feelings of disrespect. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being made to defend one's identity repeatedly can be exhausting, especially in a relationship where trust and acceptance are key. The girlfriend's friend's involvement might also contribute to the pressure, making the situation more about others' opinions than the couple's dynamic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He has the right to be respected as he is. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps stemming from concern or curiosity, are invasive and disrespectful of his autonomy. The author's anger is a valid response to being questioned in a way that undermines his self-identification. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
