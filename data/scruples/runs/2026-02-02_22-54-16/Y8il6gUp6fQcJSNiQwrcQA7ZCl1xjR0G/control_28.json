Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual female. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times in the past, which he's fine with answering. Now his girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality, even checking his porn history, and he's getting frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his straightness even though he's stated it clearly.\n\nThe key points here are: the author explicitly states he's straight, the girlfriend is persistently doubting that, and the author is upset about being questioned repeatedly. The girlfriend's friend also contributed by suggesting he might be gay based on his initial nervousness during sex.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. Let's break it down. From a general perspective, if someone clearly states their sexuality and another person keeps doubting or questioning it without valid reason, that could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Especially in a trusting relationship, constant questioning might indicate a lack of trust. The author's frustration seems justified because he's being asked the same question multiple times despite clear answers.\n\nHowever, could there be other angles? Maybe the girlfriend's concerns stem from her own insecurities or experiences. But the problem here is that the girlfriend is not accepting the author's assertions, which is leading to repeated questioning. The author isn't being dishonest; he's being asked repeatedly, which is intrusive. \n\nAlso, checking his porn history is a privacy violation, which is definitely a red flag. That action alone suggests a breach of trust. The author's anger towards the girlfriend and her friend for not taking him at his word and for the privacy issue seems valid. \n\nThe user mentions it's 2019, but this is more about the context of the time rather than the actual issue. The core issue is about trust and respect in the relationship. The author is not part of the LGBTQ+ community in this scenario, so he doesn't have to deal with the same challenges that others might when coming out. His frustration is about being forced to defend his sexuality repeatedly, which is not a typical situation in a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the ones that are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
