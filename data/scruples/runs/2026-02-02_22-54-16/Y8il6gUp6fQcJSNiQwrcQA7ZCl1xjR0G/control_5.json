Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, and he doesn't mind answering. However, his girlfriend has recently started questioning his sexuality again, even after he told her he's straight. She mentioned it to her friend, who suggested he might be gay, leading her to search his porn history. Now he's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his straightness.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and trust in a relationship. The author feels that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it, which is frustrating. From his perspective, if he were gay, he would be comfortable with it now, and he doesn't see why he has to keep proving his sexuality. His girlfriend's actions (telling friends, checking his phone) might be seen as invasive and not trusting him. \n\nHowever, I should also consider the girlfriend's point of view. If she's bisexual and maybe not fully secure in the relationship, her curiosity might stem from her own insecurities or past experiences. But the way she's handling it\u2014repeated questioning, searching his phone\u2014could be crossing boundaries. Trust is essential in any relationship, and if one partner is constantly doubting the other without cause, that's a problem.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because no one should have to repeatedly justify their sexuality, especially if they're comfortable with it. The girlfriend's actions might be rooted in insecurity, but the method of addressing it is problematic. The author has the right to feel upset about being distrustful and having his privacy invaded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The issue lies in the girlfriend's behavior and lack of trust, which could indicate deeper issues in the relationship that need to be addressed through communication. The author's reaction is a response to her actions, which are not respectful. So, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
