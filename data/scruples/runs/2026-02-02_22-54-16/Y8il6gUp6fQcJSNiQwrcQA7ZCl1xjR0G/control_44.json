Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the author is straight and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, which he's okay with. However, his girlfriend, who is bisexual, has started questioning him after he had some initial performance issues during sex. She even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word, especially in 2019, and considers it hypocritical given her own orientation.\n\nNow, from the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly despite giving a direct answer. That can be annoying, especially if he's not closeted and has no reason for others to doubt him. The girlfriend's actions, like searching his history, might be seen as invasive. The author is within his rights to feel frustrated if he's being forced to defend his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons. She's bi, so she might be more attuned to different sexual orientations. Maybe she's insecure or has past experiences that make her question his commitment. But even so, repeatedly questioning and invading privacy (checking porn history) isn't healthy. Trust is important in a relationship, and if she can't respect his answer, that's a problem.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset when someone doesn't take his words seriously. However, it's also important for the girlfriend to understand that her actions are causing harm. The author's frustration is justified if her questions are intrusive and dismissive of his identity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He has a right to be upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy invaded without trust.\n"
