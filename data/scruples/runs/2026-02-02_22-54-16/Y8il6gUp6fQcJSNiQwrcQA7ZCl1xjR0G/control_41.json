Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a straight guy dating a bisexual girlfriend. She keeps asking him if he's gay, even after he's told her he's not. He gets annoyed because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, and he's frustrated that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it. The girlfriend even checked his porn history to confirm he's not watching gay content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's heterosexual and doesn't want to be questioned repeatedly. He feels it's frustrating and unnecessary, especially since he's already stated his sexual orientation. He also mentions that it's 2019, implying that he believes people should be more accepting and not question someone's sexuality once they state it. He also points out the hypocrisy because his girlfriend is bisexual, so he feels it's unfair she's doubting his identity while she's part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend's behavior might stem from her own insecurities or lack of trust. Maybe she's anxious about his commitment or her own identity as a bisexual woman in a heterosexual relationship. Her friend might have influenced her, suggesting that his initial nervousness during sex could indicate something else. But does that justify repeatedly questioning him? Checking someone's private data without consent, like porn history, is a big red flag. That's an invasion of privacy and can be seen as distrustful or controlling.\n\nThe key issues here are trust, respect, and communication. The author is justified in feeling upset if his girlfriend isn't respecting his stated sexuality and is instead resorting to invasive actions. However, there's also the aspect of open communication. Maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship that needs to be addressed, like trust or insecurity. But the girlfriend's actions cross a boundary by invading his privacy, which is problematic.\n\nIn terms of the author getting angry, it's reasonable for him to feel frustrated. His sexual orientation is a personal matter, and being constantly questioned despite stating it isn't fair. The girlfriend's actions aren't just about questioning but also about not trusting his honesty, which is a more serious issue. The fact that he's heterosexual and not part of the LGBTQ+ community might mean he's not facing the same societal pressures to come out, but his identity should still be respected once stated.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If the girlfriend has a history of being in situations where people's sexual orientations were fluid or if she has personal anxieties, that could contribute. But even then, checking his porn history is not a valid way to address her concerns. Effective communication would involve discussing her insecurities without violating his privacy or repeatedly doubting his identity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry. His girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author has the right to be upset about being disbelieved and having his privacy invaded. The girlfriend needs to work on trust and communication rather than questioning his sexuality in such a way.\n"
