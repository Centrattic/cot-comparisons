Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for being angry that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is heterosexual, his girlfriend is bisexual. She asked him if he's gay multiple times. He says he's straight, but she keeps doubting him, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels like he should be believed without question, especially since she's bi and should understand LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nSo the main points here: the girlfriend's repeated questioning and the author's frustration. The author is upset because he's tired of defending his sexuality. The girlfriend might be concerned about his performance in bed, which led her to think he might be gay. But the author feels it's hypocritical because she's supposed to be accepting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to feel respected and not have to constantly prove his sexuality. Being made to defend something he's already stated could be hurtful. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities or reasons for her actions, like if she's worried about their relationship or her own orientation.\n\nBut the key here is that the author is heterosexual and has already told her he's straight. The girlfriend's actions seem to be questioning his honesty or trustworthiness without valid reason. If there's no new information, repeatedly asking and checking his history could be seen as distrustful. The author's frustration is about being treated as if he's hiding something, which isn't fair if he's already been truthful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend told a friend, who then suggested he's gay. That friend might be influencing her, but the author shouldn't have to deal with third-party judgments. The fact that the girlfriend isn't taking his answer at face value is the problem here. So the author's anger is about being disbelieved despite stating his sexuality clearly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend is in the wrong because she's not respecting his self-identification. The author is justified in being upset about being questioned repeatedly. The girlfriend might need to address her own insecurities or lack of trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
