Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The situation involves the girlfriend questioning his sexuality again after he already told her he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is heterosexual, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before, which he's okay with. The issue arises because the girlfriend started questioning him again, even after he confirmed he's straight. She even checked his porn history, which might be a privacy issue. He's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he's comfortable with it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. The girlfriend might be insecure or have her own reasons for doubting his sexuality. But the author has a right to privacy, and being repeatedly questioned even after he's answered could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, might be an invasion of privacy, which is a red flag in a relationship. The author feeling the need to defend his sexuality is understandable, especially if he's comfortable with it and has communicated it clearly.\n\nAlso, the time frame is five months, and the girlfriend's friend is involved in suggesting he's gay. The author might feel that his girlfriend isn't taking his identity seriously. The key points are the repeated questioning, invasion of privacy, and lack of trust. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being disrespected and not being trusted. The girlfriend's actions are problematic here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the girlfriend has valid insecurities? But even so, the author's feelings are valid too. The main issue is the ongoing questioning and privacy violation. So the answer is B.\n"
