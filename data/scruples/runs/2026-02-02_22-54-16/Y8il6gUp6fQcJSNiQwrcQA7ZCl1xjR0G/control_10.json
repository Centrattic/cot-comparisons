Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a straight guy dating a bisexual girlfriend. She's been asking him multiple times if he's gay, which he finds annoying. He's given his sexuality clearly, but she keeps doubting him. He even mentions she checked his porn history to confirm. He's frustrated because it feels like he has to defend his sexuality, and he's upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it. The question is whether he's at fault for being mad about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly heterosexual and has communicated that to his girlfriend. Being questioned repeatedly could be frustrating, especially if it's affecting their relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for doubting. Maybe she's insecure, or she's heard things from a friend, or she's had past experiences where people weren't honest about their sexuality.\n\nBut the key point here is trust. In a healthy relationship, partners should trust each other. If the girlfriend doesn't trust his answer about his sexuality, that's a problem. The author isn't doing anything wrong by stating his orientation. It's his right to be who he is, and if his partner can't accept that, maybe it's her issue. The fact that she even searched his porn history without permission is a red flag. That's an invasion of privacy and could indicate deeper trust issues.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because being asked repeatedly can be seen as dismissive of his identity. He's not in the wrong for being upset. However, the way he responds could be important. If he's angry, they should talk about why there's a lack of trust. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not how he should handle it. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's bisexuality shouldn't make her judgment about his sexuality any more valid. Everyone has the right to self-identify. The fact that the girlfriend isn't taking his word at face value is problematic. The author isn't obligated to prove his sexuality through his porn history. Privacy is a big deal here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here\u2014her lack of trust and privacy invasion. The author's frustration is justified, especially in a modern context where people are expected to accept others' identities without constant questioning. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
