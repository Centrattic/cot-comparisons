Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He mentions that he's been asked if he's gay multiple times in the past but has always identified as straight. However, his girlfriend started questioning his sexuality after their first sexual encounter where he was nervous and had trouble climaxing. She even checked his porn history, which the author found frustrating.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated questioning despite the author clearly stating he's straight. The author feels it's unfair to have to defend his sexuality, especially since he's in a heterosexual relationship. He also points out hypocrisy because he's the one being questioned, not her, even though she's bisexual. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's frustrated because he's being forced to prove his sexuality, which he feels is unnecessary. He respects the LGBTQ+ community but doesn't want to be treated as if he's hiding something. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, could be seen as invasive and not trusting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for being concerned. Maybe she's insecure, or she's been in past situations where partners weren't truthful. But the problem is she's not taking his answer at face value, which can lead to mistrust in a relationship. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling disrespected and not being believed. In a healthy relationship, mutual trust is essential. If one partner doesn't trust the other's statements, that's a problem. The girlfriend's actions might indicate deeper issues, like insecurity or a lack of communication.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic because she's repeatedly questioning his sexuality and invading his privacy. The author's frustration is valid in this context.\n"
