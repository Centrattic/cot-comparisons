Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. They mentioned the girlfriend kept asking if he's gay, even after he told her he's straight. The author is upset because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and it's frustrating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is bisexual, so maybe she's more open to different sexual orientations, but that doesn't mean she can't have doubts. However, the key point is that the author has clearly stated he's straight multiple times, yet the girlfriend continues to question him. That seems like a lack of trust or respect. \n\nThe author mentions that his nervousness during sex initially led her to think he might be gay. But he's addressed that and clarified his sexuality. The fact that she even searched through his porn history is invasive and crosses boundaries. The author's frustration is valid because he's being made to justify his identity repeatedly, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The girlfriend's actions are intrusive and disrespectful. The author has the right to feel annoyed when his sexuality is questioned despite his clear statements. Plus, the girlfriend's friend is involved, which adds another layer of unnecessary pressure. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the girlfriend has a history of being in relationships with gay partners? The scenario doesn't mention that. The author's stance is that in 2019, people should be comfortable with their sexuality, but the issue here is the constant questioning rather than the author's own comfort. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem. The right answer is B."
