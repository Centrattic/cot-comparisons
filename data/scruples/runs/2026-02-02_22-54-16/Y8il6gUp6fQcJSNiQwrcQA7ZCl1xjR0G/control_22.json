Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (he's the one writing the question) is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality in the past but it's not a big deal for him. Now, since they've been dating for 5 months, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, started questioning his sexuality. The woman initially thought he was gay because he was nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing at first. She even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he's stated he's straight, but she keeps doubting him. He feels like he has to defend his sexuality and is annoyed that his girlfriend isn't taking him seriously, even though she's bi and should be more understanding.\n\nSo the main points are: \n1. The author is heterosexual, the girlfriend is bisexual. \n2. The girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay, leading her to question him repeatedly.\n3. He's upset because it's been a few months and she's still doubting him, making him feel like he has to defend his sexuality, which he finds frustrating and hypocritical given her own identity.\n4. He's mad at both his girlfriend and her friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, I need to consider if his reaction is justified. From his perspective, he's clearly stated his sexuality, and the repeated questioning is making him feel disrespected or not trusted. The girlfriend's actions (checking his porn history) might be an invasion of privacy, which is a red flag in any relationship. Also, the friend's role in spreading the idea that he's gay might be problematic. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might be coming from a place of insecurity, maybe not trusting him, or perhaps her own biases. But since she's bi, she should be more accepting. The fact that she's checking his private data (porn history) is a big issue. The author's frustration with being questioned repeatedly despite giving clear answers is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns? If he was nervous during sex, maybe she's worried about his comfort or if there's an issue in their intimacy. But after five months, if he's addressed the problem and things have improved, maybe her continued doubts are unwarranted. \n\nIn terms of societal context, the author mentions it's 2019, implying that being straight should be accepted without question, especially in a relationship where the partner is part of the LGBTQ+ community. However, trust and communication are key in relationships. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as disrespectful and not trusting him, which is a valid reason for the author to be upset. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong (B) because he's being asked to defend his sexuality unnecessarily, his privacy was invaded, and trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and actions are the problematic ones here. The author's frustration is justified, and he's within his rights to be upset with her and her friend for not taking his sexuality at face value and for the privacy invasion.\n"
