Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He doesn't mind people asking before but now she's doing it multiple times, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: he's heterosexual and feels that his sexuality should be accepted without question. He's annoyed that his girlfriend isn't taking his statement seriously, especially after multiple confirmations. He's frustrated because it's 2019, and he expects people to accept others' self-identification without constant questioning. The girlfriend's perspective: she's bisexual, and maybe her friend suggested that his nervousness during sex might indicate he's gay. She wants to be sure, perhaps for her own reassurance or due to the friend's influence. \n\nIs there a valid reason for her to question him repeatedly? If he's been open about being straight before, then she might not have a solid reason to keep doubting him. However, maybe she's trying to be open-minded or has personal reasons for needing confirmation. But in a trusting relationship, constant questioning about someone's sexuality without real evidence could be seen as invasive or disrespectful. \n\nThe author mentions that after he told her he's straight, she still continued to check his history. That seems like a breach of privacy. Even if someone is trying to be honest, invading privacy in that way can be hurtful. Also, the fact that she went to a friend for advice suggests that maybe she's not confident in the relationship's trust. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. If someone keeps questioning your identity despite explicit statements, it can feel dismissive. The user's point about hypocrisy is valid because if he were LGBTQ+ and came out, he wouldn't expect constant questioning. The same respect should be afforded to him. \n\nBut maybe there's a deeper issue here. If the girlfriend is bisexual, her friend's comment might stem from some internalized bias, thinking that straight men wouldn't have certain nervousness. However, that's a stereotype. Physical performance issues can happen for various reasons unrelated to sexuality. The girlfriend might need to address why she's not trusting her partner's self-identification. \n\nAlso, communication is key. The author might need to express his feelings about being questioned so much, and the girlfriend might need to explain why she's doing it. However, the girlfriend's actions (searching his history) are problematic regardless. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong to feel frustrated. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not respecting his stated sexuality and invading his privacy. The author's anger is a reasonable response to being disbelieved and pried into. So the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
