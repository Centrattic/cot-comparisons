Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about being gay before, but usually doesn't mind. Now with his girlfriend, she's asked multiple times, even checked his porn history, and it's making him frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heterosexual and has clearly stated that he's not gay. The girlfriend's repeated questioning could stem from insecurity or curiosity. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels he should be believed without needing to prove himself. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has concerns about the relationship or her own insecurities that are causing her to question his sexuality repeatedly.\n\nThe key points are: the author is being asked repeatedly despite stating he's straight, the girlfriend's friend suggested it, and the author is upset about being questioned like this. The author also mentions that he's confident in his sexuality, so being made to defend it could be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might be overstepping boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for feeling frustrated. People should trust each other's self-identified sexuality unless there's a valid reason for doubt. The girlfriend's actions here might indicate a lack of trust or communication issues. The author is not in the wrong for being upset, especially if the questioning is intrusive and persistent. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
