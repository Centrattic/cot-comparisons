Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed at their girlfriend for repeatedly questioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and has been asked about their sexuality multiple times before. They don't mind answering but are now frustrated that their girlfriend keeps doubting them. The girlfriend's friend suggested the author might be gay, leading her to question them again and even check their porn history. The author feels it's 2019, and if they were gay, they'd be comfortable admitting it by now. They find it hypocritical since their girlfriend is bisexual but doesn't accept their straightness.\n\nHmm, the key points here: The author is clear they're straight, yet the girlfriend continues to question them. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through the author's phone, might be invasive and disrespectful. The author's frustration is about being doubted despite their openness. The girlfriend might be struggling with her own insecurities or trust issues. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If the girlfriend can't trust the author's word, that's a problem. The author isn't at fault for being annoyed if the girlfriend isn't respecting their stated sexuality. Also, the girlfriend's friend's influence might be a red flag. The author's right to feel upset if their boundaries are crossed by her checking their porn history. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for being angry. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
