Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past without issue. However, since starting the relationship, his girlfriend has questioned him several times, even checking his porn history. The author feels it's old and wants to stop defending his sexuality, especially since he's comfortable with who he is. He's frustrated that his girlfriend isn't taking his straightness seriously, even though she's bi and should understand acceptance.\n\nI should consider communication in relationships. Trust and respect are key. If the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality without giving him the benefit of the doubt, that's a problem. She should accept his answer unless there's a legitimate reason for concern. However, maybe there's underlying insecurity on her part. Being bisexual herself, she might have her own insecurities about the relationship. But that doesn't justify not trusting him.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. If someone has made their sexuality clear and the partner keeps doubting it, that can be hurtful. The fact that she even checked his phone without consent is a red flag. Privacy violations are a big issue. The author getting annoyed is a natural reaction to being disrespected and not trusted.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend has reasons for her doubts. The initial nervousness during sex led her to question it. However, if that's the case, she should address her own insecurities or communicate her concerns instead of repeatedly accusing him. The fact that she told a friend, who then suggested he's gay, might show that she's not handling her feelings appropriately.\n\nThe author's stance is about mutual respect and acceptance. He's not asking to be in the LGBTQ+ community but wants his sexuality to be taken at face value. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from her own issues, which she needs to work on. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy invaded.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are respect, trust, and how the girlfriend is handling the situation, which seems to lack these elements.\n"
