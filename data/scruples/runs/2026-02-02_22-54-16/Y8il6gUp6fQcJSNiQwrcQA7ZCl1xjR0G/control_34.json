Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality before because he gives off a vibe that makes people think he's gay. He doesn't mind telling people he's straight, but he's frustrated that his girlfriend keeps questioning it. The girlfriend started suspecting he's gay after some initial nervousness during sex, and told a friend who suggested it. The girlfriend then asked him, and he said he's straight. But she keeps bringing it up, even searching his porn history. The author is annoyed because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, finds it hypocritical given his girlfriend's bisexuality, and thinks they should be past this in 2019.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is defensive about his sexuality, the girlfriend keeps questioning it, and he's upset about it. Now, to determine if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly despite clearly stating he's straight. He finds it frustrating and feels disrespected, especially because he's in a heterosexual relationship. He might feel that his identity is being doubted unnecessarily. On the other hand, the girlfriend might think she's trying to understand his sexuality or her own insecurities, but her actions (like checking his porn history) are invasive and could be seen as distrustful.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend also doesn't accept the author is straight, which adds to the pressure. The author is upset about this situation. The key here is whether the author's anger is justified. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. If the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality without valid reasons, that could be an issue. However, if the author's initial nervousness during sex caused her concerns, maybe she's dealing with her own insecurities. But invading privacy by checking his history is problematic. The author has every right to be upset about being disrespected and not taken at face value. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that it's 2019 and he thinks society should be past needing to defend one's sexuality. He's heterosexual, so he might not fully understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, but his frustration is about being doubted. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions could be seen as a lack of trust, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The author is justified in feeling that he should be believed when he states his sexual orientation. However, if there were genuine concerns about his behavior or past actions, that might be different. But the scenario suggests that the girlfriend's suspicions are based on her friend's opinion and a past issue with performance, which might not be a solid foundation for ongoing questioning.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and invasion of privacy are the main issues here, not the author's reaction. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
