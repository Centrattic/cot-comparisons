Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual, and she's been asking him if he's gay multiple times, even checking his porn history. The author feels it's frustrating that he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he's comfortable with being straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or curiosity. But repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality, especially after they've confirmed it, can be hurtful. The author's frustration is valid because it's his right to feel secure in his identity. The girlfriend's actions might be disrespectful, invading privacy by checking his porn history, which is a major red flag in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality before, so maybe the girlfriend is projecting her own biases. However, trust issues in a relationship are serious. If the girlfriend can't trust the author's self-identification, that could be a deeper problem. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about being questioned constantly, especially if it's affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nFrom a modern perspective, respecting someone's self-identified sexuality is important. The girlfriend's friend adding to the problem by suggesting he's gay isn't helpful either. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries and is causing unnecessary stress, the author's anger makes sense. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the girlfriend is dealing with her own insecurities about her bisexuality or fears of being with someone who might not be fully committed. But that doesn't excuse her actions. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated with her lack of trust and the repeated questioning. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
