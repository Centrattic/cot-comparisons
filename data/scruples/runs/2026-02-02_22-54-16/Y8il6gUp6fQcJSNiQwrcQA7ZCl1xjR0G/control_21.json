Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. The girlfriend asked if he's gay, and even went so far as checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he's already told her he's straight, and he feels like he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly. He's upset that she doesn't take him seriously, especially considering her own bisexuality and the current societal context of 2019 where he expects more acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being asked repeatedly despite already stating his sexuality, which is causing frustration. He feels it's hypocritical given his girlfriend's bisexuality and the general societal progress on LGBTQ+ acceptance. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be concerned due to the initial hesitation during sex and possibly wants reassurance about his feelings towards her. Her actions, like checking his porn history, might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of trust and respect in a relationship. If someone is repeatedly questioning their partner's sexuality in a way that invades privacy (like checking porn history), that could be a sign of mistrust. The author's frustration is understandable because he feels his self-identification isn't being respected. However, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities or reasons for her behavior, which could be rooted in her own experiences or lack of trust.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset when his sexuality is questioned repeatedly without taking his word at face value. However, the girlfriend's actions (checking his history) are a privacy issue. The author's anger is a valid reaction to being disbelieved and having his trust violated. It's possible that both parties have valid points, but the main issue is the lack of communication and understanding.\n\nIn terms of accountability, if the girlfriend is making him feel defensive about his identity, that's a problem. The author isn't the one violating trust by checking her phone or something; she's the one questioning him without reason. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. Since he's the one being questioned and disbelieved, it's more about the girlfriend's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B (No).\n"
