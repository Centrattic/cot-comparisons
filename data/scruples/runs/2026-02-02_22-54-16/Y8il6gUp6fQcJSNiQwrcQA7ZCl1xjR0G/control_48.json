Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, and the girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before because he gives off a vibe, but he's okay with explaining. When they started dating, he had some nervousness during sex, which led the girlfriend to suggest he might be gay. She told a friend, who then told her to ask again. He said he's straight, but she keeps questioning him, even checking his porn history. Now he's frustrated and angry because he feels he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly.\n\nThe author's argument is that in 2019, if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. He finds it hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi but doesn't take his straightness seriously. He's upset because he's not being accepted at face value.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, trust is a big part of a relationship. If the girlfriend is doubting his sexuality without valid reasons, that's a problem. The fact that she asked a friend for confirmation and then checked his porn history is invasive. The author has the right to feel that his self-identification should be respected. On the flip side, maybe the girlfriend is concerned about his performance issues and is trying to understand, but her approach is problematic. \n\nThe key points are: repeated questioning despite his clear statement, invasion of privacy (checking porn history), and the author's frustration over not being believed. The girlfriend's actions seem to breach trust and respect. The author is in a position where he's being made to defend a basic aspect of his identity, which is valid. However, the author's frustration might come off as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings or concerns. But given the context, the main issue is her lack of trust and respect for his self-identification. So, the author is not in the wrong here because he's being asked to justify his sexuality in a way that's not appropriate post-coming out. The girlfriend's actions are the problem, not the author's frustration.\n"
