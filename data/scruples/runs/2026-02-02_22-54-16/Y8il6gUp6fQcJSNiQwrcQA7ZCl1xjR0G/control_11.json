Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but doesn't mind answering. The girlfriend started questioning his sexuality after some initial sexual performance issues. She even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he's stated he's straight, but she keeps doubting him.\n\nSo, the main points: The author is getting annoyed because his girlfriend isn't respecting his stated sexuality. He feels it's hypocritical since she's bi and should understand. The girlfriend's friend is also involved, which complicates things. \n\nFrom a standpoint of respect and trust in a relationship, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as intrusive or not trusting him. If he's explicitly stated he's straight, her continued questioning could be a breach of trust. However, maybe she's dealing with her own insecurities or has past experiences that make her question. But even so, repeated questioning after being told directly could be problematic. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's not in a situation where he's hiding his sexuality; he's stating it clearly. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or a lack of trust, which is her issue. The fact that she's bi might make her more sensitive to sexuality topics, but that doesn't justify doubting him. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the girlfriend is persistently questioning his sexuality despite his clear assertions, she's at fault. The author is justified in feeling upset because he's being asked to defend something he's not hiding. The friend's involvement might also be part of the problem, but the main issue is the girlfriend's trust and respect for his identity. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here, not his frustration at her lack of trust.\n"
