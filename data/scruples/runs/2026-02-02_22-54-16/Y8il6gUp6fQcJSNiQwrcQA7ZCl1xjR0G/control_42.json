Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a straight man dating a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality before because he gives off a vibe, but he's okay with telling people he's straight. His girlfriend started thinking he might be gay after some initial sexual issues and mentioned it to a friend, who then suggested it to her. She's checked his porn history and asked multiple times. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word, especially since he's in a relationship with a bi woman and in 2019, he thinks it's outdated to question someone's sexuality like this.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's repeated questioning by his girlfriend is making him angry. He's straight, he's told her, but she keeps doubting him. He's annoyed that he has to defend his sexuality, even though he knows this is something LGBTQ+ people face. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is key. If the girlfriend is repeatedly questioning his sexuality without valid reason, that could be a trust issue. But maybe there's a reason she's concerned? The initial sexual performance might have made her doubt his experience or comfort with sex. However, the author clarified he's straight, so if she's not believing him, that's a problem. Also, searching through his phone is a privacy issue. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He feels he should be trusted when he states his sexuality. If someone is in a committed relationship, the partner should accept their word unless there's a valid reason for doubt. The girlfriend's actions could be rooted in insecurity or her own experiences. But the fact that she's bi and the author is straight might play a role here. Maybe she's projecting her own bisexuality onto him or has some internalized stigma. \n\nHowever, the author is in the wrong if his anger is due to not accepting his girlfriend's concerns. But if he's being disrespected by her not believing him, then he's right to be upset. The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions are justified. Since the author has no history of being gay and has stated his orientation, her repeated questioning and invasion of privacy (checking porn history) are not acceptable. \n\nSo, the author's anger is a reaction to being disbelieved and having his privacy violated. In that case, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
