Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been in the situation where he's been asked if he's gay before, and he doesn't mind explaining. But with his girlfriend, after he told her he's straight, she kept asking and even checked his porn history. He's frustrated and got mad when she asked again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels it's disrespectful to have to defend his sexuality, especially since he's direct about it. He's in a relationship where he expects trust. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be worried about his performance during sex and is trying to understand. Maybe she's anxious or insecure. But the fact that she's checking his phone and repeatedly questioning him could be a breach of trust. \n\nThe author is not part of the LGBTQ+ community and identifying as straight, so this situation is different from someone coming out. He's not hiding anything; he's upfront, but she's not respecting his statement. The girlfriend's actions (searching through his history) could indicate a lack of trust, which is a problem in the relationship. The author's frustration is valid because mutual trust is essential in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend influencing her might not help the situation. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy invaded. The key points are trust, respect, and communication. The author isn't the one who's being hypocritical here; he's the one being mistrusted. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
