Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual female. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, which he's okay with. The girlfriend started questioning him after some initial sexual performance issues. She mentioned it to a friend, who suggested he might be gay. The author confirmed he's straight, but she keeps asking again, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality and that she doesn't take him seriously. He's upset about the repeated questioning and the friend's role in it.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are trust, respect, and communication. The girlfriend's actions\u2014questioning his sexuality multiple times and checking his private data\u2014could be seen as invasive and distrustful. The author has already stated he's straight, so her continued doubt might indicate a lack of trust. The fact that she brought up the friend's suggestion shows that external opinions are influencing her, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because being asked repeatedly after affirming his sexuality can be hurtful. It's 2019, and the author feels that if he were gay, he would have come to terms with it, which is a personal belief. However, the core issue here is the girlfriend's lack of trust and the invasion of privacy. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being treated with suspicion and having his privacy violated. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's actions might stem from her own insecurities or misunderstandings, but that doesn't justify the author's behavior being wrong. The situation calls for open communication, but the repeated questioning without addressing the underlying issues could be damaging. The author's right to feel frustrated and annoyed is justified here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
