Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The situation involves the author being a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual woman. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality before and usually doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend started questioning him after a specific incident during sex where he was nervous. She even checked his porn history. The author feels frustrated because he's been clear about being straight, and he's annoyed that his girlfriend doesn't take him seriously.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: trust is a big factor. If the girlfriend is searching through his private data (porn history) without consent, that's a red flag. Invasion of privacy can be a serious issue in a relationship. The author's frustration might be justified because trust issues can create unnecessary conflict. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend influencing her opinion might not be helpful. The author feels that in 2019, people should be past needing to \"prove\" their sexuality, especially since his girlfriend is bi and presumably more accepting. The hypocrisy he points out\u2014being asked repeatedly despite his clear statements\u2014could be valid. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend's concern stems from something deeper. If the author had trouble climaxing initially, maybe she's worried about other issues, but instead of addressing that directly, she's questioning his sexuality. That approach could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of the author's reaction, getting mad because he's being questioned unnecessarily could be reasonable. He's not obligated to defend his sexuality repeatedly. On the flip side, if the girlfriend's concerns are genuine and not based on privacy violations, there might be a need for communication. But since she resorted to checking his history, that's a breach of trust, which the author has every right to be upset about. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (privacy invasion) and the repeated questioning without valid reason make the author's frustration justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
