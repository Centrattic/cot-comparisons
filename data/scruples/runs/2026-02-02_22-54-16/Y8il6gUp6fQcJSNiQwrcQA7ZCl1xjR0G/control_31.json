Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually just answers and that's it. Now, his girlfriend is questioning him again, and he's frustrated because he's already told her he's straight. The girlfriend mentioned it to a friend, who suggested he might be gay, leading her to keep questioning him. The author feels like he's being forced to defend his sexuality, which is annoying, especially since he's comfortable with it and his girlfriend is bi. He's upset that she doesn't take his answer seriously.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to his sexuality and to be believed when he states it. It's not his fault if others have preconceptions. However, the girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity or past experiences. Maybe she's worried about his commitment or has a history where partners were not honest. But the author shouldn't have to constantly prove his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and not respectful. \n\nThe key point is that trust and respect are important in a relationship. If the girlfriend is persistently doubting him after he's been honest, that's a problem. The author's frustration is valid because he's not obligated to justify his orientation multiple times. The girlfriend's friend may be influencing her, but that doesn't make the questioning acceptable. \n\nIn 2019, the author is right to expect that people, especially someone in a relationship with him, should respect his self-identification. It's not just about being gay or straight, but about mutual trust. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset with her lack of trust. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
