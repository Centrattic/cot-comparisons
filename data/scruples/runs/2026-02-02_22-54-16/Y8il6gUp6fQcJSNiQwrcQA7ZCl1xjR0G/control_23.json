Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, and he's fine with telling people he's straight. Now, since the start of the relationship, the girlfriend has started to think he's gay. She told a friend about his nervousness during sex and the friend suggested it might be because he's gay. He denied it, but she keeps bringing it up again and even checked his porn history. Now he's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his straightness, especially since she's bi and he thought 2019 would be past such doubts.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are trust in the relationship, respecting boundaries (like checking his porn history without permission), and the girlfriend's persistent doubt despite his repeated assertions.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of searching through his phone might be a privacy issue. Trust is important in a relationship, and if one partner is constantly questioning the other's sexuality without valid reasons, that could be a problem. The author might feel disrespected and not trusted, which is valid. However, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities or reasons for her doubts. But given that he's a straight man and he's expressed his feelings multiple times, her continued questioning without acknowledging his stance could be seen as dismissive of his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. If someone repeatedly questions his sexuality after he's stated it clearly, that could lead to justified annoyance. The fact that the girlfriend shared this with a friend and then used that to form a suspicion might indicate her lack of trust, which isn't healthy. The author's right to feel upset about being asked multiple times and having his privacy invaded (searching porn history) is a valid point. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the problematic ones here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
