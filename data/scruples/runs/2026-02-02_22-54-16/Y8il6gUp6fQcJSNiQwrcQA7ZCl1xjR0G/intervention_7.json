Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She asked him if he's gay multiple times, even checking his porn history, which made him frustrated. The author is saying he's straight and doesn't see why he has to defend it, especially in 2019. He's upset that his girlfriend doesn't take him seriously when he states he's straight, which he feels is hypocritical given her own bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heterosexual, and the girlfriend is bisexual. The fact that she questions his sexuality multiple times, including invasive actions like checking his porn history, seems problematic. Trust issues might arise from that. The author's frustration is reasonable because he's asserting his identity and expects to be believed. However, the girlfriend might have her reasons\u2014maybe insecurity or past experiences. But the key point is that the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly and not taken seriously. The girlfriend's actions could indicate a lack of trust, which is a red flag in any relationship. The author's stance is about respecting his stated identity without needing to prove it. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
