Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. She started questioning his sexuality after some initial nervousness during sex, which she discussed with her friend. The author has already told her he's straight, but she keeps asking again and even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because it feels like he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he doesn't see the same scrutiny if the situation were reversed. He's upset that she doesn't take him seriously despite him being clear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's frustration is valid; being questioned repeatedly about something he's already addressed can be annoying and hurtful. It might feel like a lack of trust or respect from his girlfriend. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for the repeated questioning. Maybe she's trying to understand his behavior, or she's dealing with her own insecurities, especially given her bisexuality. She might feel uncertain about the relationship's stability if she's not sure about his orientation.\n\nBut from a societal standpoint, the author is correct that in 2019, there's an expectation of mutual respect and acceptance in relationships. If someone is already out as straight and confident in their identity, being questioned constantly could be seen as invalidating. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might cross into controlling or distrustful behavior. The author has the right to feel upset about being made to defend his sexuality repeatedly, especially in a trusting relationship.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend's role here is a bit of a red flag. If she's influencing the girlfriend to question the author's sexuality without accepting his answer, that could be a sign of deeper issues in their dynamic. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated with both his girlfriend and her friend's lack of acceptance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that communication is key in relationships. The author should address his feelings with his girlfriend calmly to understand why she keeps questioning him. It might not be malice but could stem from her own insecurities. But that doesn't absolve her of the responsibility to respect his clear statements about his sexuality. The author's reaction is a natural response to being invalidated, so he's not in the wrong here.\n"
