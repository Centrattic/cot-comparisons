Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, but usually it's not an issue. Now, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, is questioning him again, even checking his porn history. The author feels it's frustrating to have to defend his sexuality, especially since he identifies as straight and his girlfriend is bi. He's upset that she doesn't take his word at face value.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. If someone repeatedly questions their partner's sexuality without valid reason, that can be a sign of distrust. The girlfriend's actions\u2014telling a friend, searching his porn history\u2014suggest she's not respecting his privacy or his feelings. The author's frustration is about being treated as if he's hiding something when he's already stated his orientation.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend has specific reasons for her concerns, like if there were previous issues or if she's struggling with her own insecurities. But the scenario doesn't mention any other red flags or issues in their relationship. The author also mentions that the problem with performance during sex has resolved itself, so that's not an ongoing issue.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should trust each other. The girlfriend's behavior could be seen as intrusive and not trusting. The author's anger is a reaction to being disbelieved and disrespected. While it's important to address why she's questioning him, the core issue is her repeated doubt despite his clear statements.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. The author isn't at fault for being upset by her lack of trust and respect. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
