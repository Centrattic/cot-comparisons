Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's straight and his girlfriend, who is bi, keeps questioning his sexuality. He's frustrated because she asked multiple times, even checked his porn history, and he got mad. He's wondering if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is heterosexual, the girlfriend is bisexual. She got the idea he's gay because maybe he was nervous during sex and mentioned to her friend. She then asked him, and he clarified he's straight. But she keeps bringing it up again. He's upset because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, and he's frustrated that his assertion of being straight isn't taken seriously.\n\nSo, the main issue here is trust and respect in the relationship. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014are invasive and not respectful. Trust is a big component in any relationship, and if someone is repeatedly questioning your sexuality without valid reason, that's a red flag. The guy might feel disrespected because he's being treated as if he's hiding something, which he isn't. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or a history of similar issues. But even so, she should respect his statements. If she's not trusting him, that's a problem. The guy isn't wrong for being upset about being treated as untrustworthy. \n\nAlso, considering the context, the guy is in a relationship with a bisexual woman, and she's supposed to have more understanding. But maybe she has her own biases or fears. However, the fact that she's questioning his sexuality repeatedly, even after he's clarified, suggests she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would hinge on whether the girlfriend's actions are justified. Since there's no evidence presented that the guy is lying about his sexuality, the girlfriend's continued questioning is unwarranted. The guy's frustration is valid because he's being asked to defend something he's already stated clearly. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for getting mad. The girlfriend's actions are the problem here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
