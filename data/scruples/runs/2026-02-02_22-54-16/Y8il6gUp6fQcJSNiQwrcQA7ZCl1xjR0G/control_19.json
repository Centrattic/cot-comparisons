Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, after hearing from her friend, started questioning him multiple times. The author got annoyed because he feels he should be taken at face value when he says he's straight. He's frustrated that he has to defend his sexuality, especially since he doesn't think it's a big deal. He also mentions that his girlfriend searched his porn history, which might be a privacy issue.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's actions: she's asking repeatedly, which could indicate a lack of trust or a need for reassurance. Maybe she's insecure, or her friend influenced her. But if the author has consistently said he's straight, why is she doubting him? The fact that she checked his phone without consent is a red flag. That's a privacy violation and not okay. The author's frustration here is justified.\n\nThe author's reaction is being mad at her for the repeated questioning and the friend's role. He feels it's 2019 and should be past needing to prove his sexuality. He's not in the LGBTQ+ community and thus isn't dealing with the same societal pressures. His girlfriend being bi might make her more open, but that doesn't mean she should distrust him.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, everyone deserves trust in a relationship. If someone is honest and communicates, being questioned repeatedly without reason can be frustrating. The girlfriend's actions (searching his phone) are problematic. The author isn't the one in the wrong here. He's standing up for himself against unnecessary suspicion. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
