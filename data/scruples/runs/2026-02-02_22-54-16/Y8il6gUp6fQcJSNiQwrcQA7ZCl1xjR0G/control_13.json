Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, but generally doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, started to question his sexuality after some initial issues during sex. She even checked his porn history. Now, she keeps bringing it up again, and he's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality despite stating he's straight.\n\nThe author is upset that his girlfriend doesn't take his word for it, considering it hypocritical since she's bi and should understand LGBTQ+ issues. He's in 2019, so he expects more acceptance. The key points here are trust, respect, and communication in the relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly about his sexuality, which he finds frustrating. His girlfriend's actions (searching his porn history) might be seen as invasive. If someone is in a relationship, they should trust each other's stated identity unless there's a valid reason for concern. The author's anger comes from feeling disrespected and not being believed, which can erode trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities or past experiences that make her question. Maybe she's worried about the sexual issues or feels insecure. However, repeatedly questioning without valid reasons and invading privacy (checking porn history) isn't healthy. The author's frustration is justified because trust and mutual respect are foundational in a relationship. If he's stated he's straight and she continues to doubt it, that's a problem.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset. He's defending his right to be taken at his word, especially in a relationship where trust is essential. The girlfriend's actions suggest a lack of trust, which is the real issue here. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected, not about being wrong. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
