Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The girlfriend is bisexual, and the author is straight. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times, which he's fine with in general but finds frustrating in this context.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's had to explain his orientation before, and usually it's not an issue. The girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay because of his performance during sex, which he says hasn't been a problem since then. The girlfriend even checked his porn history. The author is upset because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality when he's clearly stated he's straight.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and respect. The girlfriend's repeated questioning and checking the porn history might be signs of insecurity or lack of trust. The author is justified in feeling frustrated if his words aren't being respected. However, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns? But the author feels it's hypocritical given her own bisexuality, so maybe she's not giving him the same respect she expects for herself.\n\nAlso, the author is in a committed relationship where he's supposed to be accepted as he is. If the girlfriend can't respect his self-identification, that's a problem. The fact that she's even suggesting he's gay without evidence and checking his history could be controlling behavior. The author is within his rights to be upset about being questioned repeatedly and not taken at face value.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. The author's frustration is valid because he's been clear about his orientation, and the girlfriend isn't respecting that. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
