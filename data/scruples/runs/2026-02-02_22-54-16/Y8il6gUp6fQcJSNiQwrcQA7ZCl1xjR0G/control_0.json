Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before but usually doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, kept questioning him even after he told her he's straight. She even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially in 2019, and finds it hypocritical given his girlfriend is bi.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust issues and repeated questioning despite him stating his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his phone, might be a breach of privacy. The author is upset because he feels disrespected and not taken at his word. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one partner doesn't believe the other's self-identified sexuality without evidence, that's a problem. The girlfriend's friend contributing to the doubt isn't helpful either. The author's frustration is valid because he's being forced to defend his identity, which can be stressful. \n\nBut maybe there's an underlying issue. Maybe the girlfriend has insecurities or trust issues. However, the way she's handling it\u2014repeated questioning and invading privacy\u2014is not healthy. The author has the right to be upset if his partner isn't respecting his boundaries or his truth. \n\nThe girlfriend might be trying to address her own anxieties, but the method is flawed. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about being disbelieved and having his privacy invaded. It's about mutual respect and trust. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
