Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is straight and doesn't mind being asked before, but now his girlfriend is repeatedly bringing it up. He mentions that she got the idea from a friend after noticing his initial nervousness during sex. He told her he's straight, but she keeps asking again and even checked his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he states his sexuality, especially since she's bi. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the answer.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is heterosexual and has been asked before without issue. Now his girlfriend, who is bisexual, is repeatedly doubting his sexuality despite him confirming it. The author is upset because he feels he should be trusted, and it's frustrating that he has to defend his identity. The girlfriend's actions include questioning and even invading privacy (checking his porn history), which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is justified in feeling annoyed if someone he's in a relationship with doesn't trust his self-identification. Trust is important in a relationship, and constant questioning without valid reason can be harmful. The girlfriend's friend might be influencing this doubt unnecessarily. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being mistrusted. The girlfriend's actions are problematic here. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
