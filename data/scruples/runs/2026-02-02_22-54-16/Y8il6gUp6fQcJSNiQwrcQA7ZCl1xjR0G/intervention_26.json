Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked before if he's gay, and he's fine with answering, but the repeated questioning from his girlfriend has made him annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he's been asked before and usually answers without issue. The girlfriend's questioning came up after he had some initial sexual tension, which she discussed with a friend, leading her to suspect he's gay. He's told her he's straight multiple times, but she keeps doubting him, even checking his porn history. The author feels it's hypocritical because he's comfortable with his identity, and he's frustrated that she doesn't take him seriously. He's in 2019, so he expects a more accepting attitude, especially from his girlfriend who is bi.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, if someone is comfortable with their identity and clearly states it, repeated questioning without valid reason might be disrespectful. The girlfriend's actions (sharing with a friend, checking his history) could be seen as intrusive and not trusting. The author's annoyance is a reaction to this lack of trust and respect for his stated identity.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's any nuance. Maybe the girlfriend felt insecure or had past experiences that made her question his orientation. However, the author hasn't provided that context. The key points here are the repeated questioning despite clear answers and the invasion of privacy. The author's right to privacy and self-identification is important. His feeling of needing to defend his sexuality multiple times is valid, especially if the girlfriend isn't providing the trust or respect he expects.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities, especially since she's bisexual. But that doesn't justify not believing his self-identified sexuality. The fact that she checked his porn history is a privacy violation, which is a significant issue. The author's frustration seems justified here. The friend's role in planting the idea might also be a factor, but the main issue is between the couple.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He has the right to be upset about being questioned repeatedly and about privacy issues. The girlfriend's actions are not respectful of his identity and privacy, and the author's annoyance is a reasonable response.\n"
