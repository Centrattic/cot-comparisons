Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality several times in the past but usually doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, after a friend suggested he might be gay due to some initial nervousness during sex, has repeatedly questioned him. She even checked his porn history. Now he's frustrated because it's been months and she keeps bringing it up. He feels like if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it, and he's upset that his girlfriend doesn't take his assertion of being straight seriously.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's repeated questioning, the initial friend's comment, the invasion of privacy with the porn history, and the author's frustration.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being asked again and again even after he's stated he's straight. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand LGBTQ+ issues. He's not in the closet and is open about his sexuality, so he's confused why it's an issue.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side, maybe she's concerned about his comfort in the relationship, especially if there were initial sexual issues. However, repeatedly questioning and checking his porn history (which is a privacy violation) isn't healthy. If she's bi, she should trust his self-identification. It seems like she's not respecting his boundaries and taking his word at face value.\n\nThe author getting annoyed is understandable because of the repeated questioning and the invasion of privacy. It's not his fault that his girlfriend is distrustful or has her own insecurities. The girlfriend's actions are problematic here. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being treated as if he's not to be trusted or taken seriously when he states his sexuality.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
