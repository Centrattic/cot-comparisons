Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as heterosexual and is in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, but now his girlfriend is persistently questioning him, even after he's told her he's straight. She even searched his porn history, which seems like an invasion of privacy. The author feels frustrated because he thinks he should be taken at face value, especially since he's comfortable with his sexuality and doesn't see why it's a problem now.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to stem from her own friend's suggestion, which might be based on the author's initial nervousness during sex. However, if the author has already confirmed his straightness multiple times, the repeated questioning could be seen as distrustful or not respecting his self-identification. The author's frustration is valid because everyone has the right to define their own identity without constant interrogation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or lack of understanding about sexuality. Maybe she's projecting her own experiences or struggles with her bisexuality onto the author. But even so, she should respect his stated identity. Trust in a relationship is important, and constant questioning can erode that trust.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to his identity and expressing frustration at being doubted. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and not appropriate. The fact that the girlfriend is bi shouldn't exempt her from respecting his sexuality. The author's reaction is a reasonable response to being disbelieved and disrespected.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
