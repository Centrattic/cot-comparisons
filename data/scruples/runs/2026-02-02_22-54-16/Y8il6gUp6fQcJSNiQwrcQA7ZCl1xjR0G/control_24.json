Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being repeatedly questioned by his girlfriend about his sexuality, even after he's stated he's straight. The girlfriend is bisexual, and she's asked multiple times, even checking his porn history. The author is upset because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality, which he finds frustrating since he's not in the LGBTQ+ community and expects to be believed when he says he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to be respected and not have his sexuality questioned repeatedly without cause. If he's clear about his identity and the girlfriend continues to doubt him, that's a problem. Maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or misunderstandings. But does that make the author in the wrong for being upset?\n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like searching through his phone, are invasive and not okay. The author has a right to be annoyed by that. Also, if he's been consistent in stating his sexuality, then the girlfriend's continued questioning is disrespectful. However, maybe there's a lack of communication here. The author might not have addressed why the questioning keeps happening. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the girlfriend is not respecting his boundaries and his identity, then the author isn't wrong for feeling frustrated. The fact that he's in a relationship with her suggests that they should trust each other. The girlfriend's actions seem to lack trust, which is more her issue. The author's reaction is justified because he's being made to feel like he's not believed despite stating his sexuality clearly. \n\nAlso, considering the context of 2019, the author emphasizes that if he were gay, he'd be comfortable with it by now. While that's his personal view, it's not necessarily invalid. However, it's important to note that people's comfort levels with their identity vary, but in this case, the author is clear he's straight. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's stance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend is overstepping by not taking his sexuality seriously and invading his privacy. The author's frustration is a valid response to being disrespected in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
