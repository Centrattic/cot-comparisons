Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times, even though he's comfortable stating he's straight. The girlfriend started questioning him after he had some initial performance issues during sex. She mentioned it to a friend, who suggested he might be gay. The author is frustrated that his girlfriend doesn't take his straightness seriously, even though he's told her multiple times and even checked his porn history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expressing frustration about being repeatedly questioned about his sexuality despite being clear. It's important to assess whether his reaction is justified. On one hand, being asked repeatedly can be annoying and make someone feel disbelieved. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be seeking reassurance due to her own insecurities or past experiences, especially since she's bisexual and might have her own issues with insecurity in relationships.\n\nThe author's main points are that he's frustrated with having to defend his sexuality and that it's hypocritical given his girlfriend is bi and should understand the struggle of being questioned about one's identity. He also points out that he's comfortable with his identity and doesn't see why he should have to keep justifying it. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014might indicate a lack of trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship. If she's not trusting his word and is invading his privacy, that's a problem. However, her initial concern might stem from her own insecurities. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad. \n\nThe author's anger is a response to repeated questioning and privacy invasion. If the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries and is causing unnecessary stress, then the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author's approach in expressing his anger might affect the relationship. He should consider addressing his feelings in a constructive way, not just lashing out.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key is whether the author has done something to deserve being blamed. He's not denying his sexuality in a harmful way; he's just frustrated with being doubted. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue here\u2014lack of trust and repeated questioning. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being treated as if he's hiding something. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
