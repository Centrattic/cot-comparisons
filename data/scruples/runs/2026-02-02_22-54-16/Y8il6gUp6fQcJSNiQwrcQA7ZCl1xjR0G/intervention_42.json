Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She's been asking him repeatedly if he's gay, which he finds frustrating. He's told her he's straight, but she keeps doubting him, even checking his porn history. The author is upset because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality, and he's annoyed that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author isn't in the wrong if his girlfriend is being unreasonable. People should trust each other in a relationship. If someone says they're straight, and there's no reason to doubt them, then questioning them repeatedly could be a problem. The author mentions that others have asked him about his sexuality in the past, but he's always been comfortable stating he's straight. So maybe his girlfriend's behavior is baseless.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be insecure or have reasons for her doubts. Sometimes in relationships, people might act out of anxiety or past experiences. But that doesn't justify repeatedly questioning a partner who has already confirmed their sexuality. The author also mentions that the girlfriend told a friend about his sexual performance, leading to the idea he might be gay. That could be a breach of trust if she discussed private matters without permission.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect. The girlfriend's actions of checking his porn history and continuing to question him after he's given his answer can be seen as a lack of trust. The author is justified in feeling frustrated because he's being asked to prove something he's already stated. It's 2019, and he's in a heterosexual relationship, so unless there's some other context not mentioned, her doubts seem unfounded.\n\nHowever, maybe there's an underlying issue. The author could consider if there are communication problems in their relationship. But based on the information given, the girlfriend isn't acting in a way that's respectful of his boundaries. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly without valid reasons. He's not the one who initiated the doubt, nor is he the one acting in a way that would question his sexuality. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
