Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She's been repeatedly asking him if he's gay, even after he told her he's straight. He's getting annoyed because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality and she's not taking him seriously. The main question is whether he's at fault for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is heterosexual and has been comfortable with that identity. He's been asked about his sexuality in the past, which he's okay with, but now his girlfriend keeps questioning him. The girlfriend might be concerned because of his nervousness during sex and a past incident where she shared this with her friend, leading to her suspicion. She's probably trying to address her own anxieties or insecurities, maybe about his interest in her or his commitment. But her actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and not respectful.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's frustrated because he's being forced to repeatedly assert his straightness, which he finds unnecessary. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi, and he thinks in 2019, people should be past needing constant validation of sexuality. He's upset because her actions make him feel doubted and not trusted.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, mutual respect is key. The girlfriend's behavior seems to lack trust, which can be harmful. However, her questioning might stem from her own insecurities or misunderstandings. The author's frustration is valid because being in a relationship should involve trust. Repeated questioning despite clear answers could be seen as disrespectful. The act of checking his porn history is a privacy invasion, which is definitely not okay.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being mad? Well, if someone is making you feel like you're constantly having to prove your sexuality, it's reasonable to feel upset. He's not doing anything wrong by being straight, and the girlfriend's actions are the issue here. The author's reaction is about being treated with respect, so he's justified in his frustration. The problem lies with the girlfriend's lack of trust and boundaries, not the author's feelings about it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for being angry. The girlfriend's behavior is the root of the problem here. He's right to feel frustrated because he's being asked to defend something he's already stated clearly. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
