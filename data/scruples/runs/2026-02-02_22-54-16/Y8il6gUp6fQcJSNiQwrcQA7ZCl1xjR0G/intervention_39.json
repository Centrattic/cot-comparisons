Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is heterosexual, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked if he's gay multiple times before, but generally doesn't mind. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, has questioned him several times. The author feels it's frustrating and hypocritical, especially since he's direct about his sexuality and his girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is clear about being straight, yet his girlfriend keeps doubting him. He's annoyed because he feels like he has to constantly defend his sexuality. The girlfriend's friend even suggested he might be gay, leading her to check his porn history. The author is upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his words at face value, and he finds it hypocritical given her own bisexuality.\n\nI should think about communication in relationships. Trust is a big part here. If the author has told his girlfriend he's straight, and she continues to question it without valid reason, that's a problem. The fact that she searched through his porn history is a breach of trust and privacy. The author's frustration seems justified because he's being asked repeatedly, which could indicate a lack of trust from her side.\n\nAlso, the context of 2019 is mentioned, but it's 2023 now. However, the principle remains the same: mutual respect and trust in a relationship. The author isn't hiding his sexuality; he's open about it. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding. But regardless of her reasons, repeatedly questioning his sexuality without evidence is not appropriate. The author has a right to be upset about being doubted, especially when he's being clear and direct.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's friend's role. The friend's suggestion might have planted a seed of doubt, but it's up to the girlfriend to trust her partner. The author isn't wrong for being mad at both his girlfriend and her friend for not accepting his declaration of being straight. It's important in relationships that partners respect each other's statements unless there's a valid reason to question them. Here, the author's behavior doesn't indicate being gay; the doubts are unfounded.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is justified in his frustration. His girlfriend's actions\u2014questioning his sexuality multiple times and invading his privacy\u2014cross boundaries. The author's reaction is a response to a lack of trust and respect, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
