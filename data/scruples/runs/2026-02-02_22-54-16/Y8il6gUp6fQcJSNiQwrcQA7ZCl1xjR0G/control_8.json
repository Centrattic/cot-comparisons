Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality a lot, maybe because he gives off a vibe. He's okay with explaining he's straight, but the girlfriend keeps doubting him. She even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality, and it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand acceptance.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the girlfriend's lack of trust and repeated questioning. The author is getting angry because he feels disrespected. Now, is he in the wrong? Well, trust is crucial in a relationship. If someone is honest about their sexuality but the partner doesn't believe them, that's a problem. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his history, might indicate insecurity or jealousy, which isn't healthy. The author's frustration seems justified because he's being asked repeatedly despite his clear answers. \n\nHowever, maybe there's something deeper. The girlfriend might have her own insecurities or experiences that make her doubt. But the key here is that the author is honest and consistent in his answers. It's 2019, and the author is in a position where he can openly state his sexuality. The girlfriend's repeated questioning could be a sign of not respecting his identity. The author getting mad is a reaction to being disbelieved, which isn't fair. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
