Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. The girlfriend is bisexual, and the author is heterosexual. He mentions that he's been asked before and doesn't mind, but his girlfriend brought it up again after he already told her he's straight. She even checked his porn history and asked again recently.\n\nThe author feels it's frustrating because he's straight and doesn't see why he has to defend that. He thinks it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi but doesn't take his sexuality seriously. He's in 2019, so he expects acceptance.\n\nI need to decide if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend might be worried for a reason. Maybe she's insecure, or her friend suggested it. But the author has already stated he's straight multiple times, so repeated questioning could be a trust issue. The author's frustration is about not being believed and having to defend his sexuality. \n\nIs it his fault for getting angry? If the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries or his answers, then she's in the wrong. But if he's being defensive without understanding her concerns, maybe he's at fault. However, it's his right to be upset if he feels disrespected. The key points are communication and mutual respect. If she's persistently doubting him without cause, that's a problem. But if there's underlying trust issues, maybe there's more to it. \n\nSince the author is clear about his sexuality and the girlfriend isn't taking it seriously, leading him to frustration, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong). The girlfriend needs to respect his boundaries and trust him. Repeated questioning after he's given his answer could be controlling or distrustful. So, the author is justified in his anger.\n"
