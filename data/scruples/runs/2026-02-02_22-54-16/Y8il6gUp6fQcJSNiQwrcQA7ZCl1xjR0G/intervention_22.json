Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality before because of his \"vibe,\" but he's comfortable saying he's straight. When they started dating, he had some nervousness during sex, which he's since overcome. His girlfriend, influenced by a friend, started questioning his sexuality. He told her he's straight, but she kept asking, even checked his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality, and he's upset that she's not taking his word seriously. He's in 2019, so he thinks he should be comfortable being gay if he were, and it's hypocritical given her bisexuality.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about trust and respect in the relationship. The girlfriend is questioning his sexuality repeatedly, which is unusual. Normally, if someone says they are straight, their partner should trust them unless there's a specific reason not to. The fact that she's checking his porn history is invasive and could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author's frustration is understandable because he feels disrespected and not believed.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her reasons. Maybe she's insecure or has past experiences that make her question. But the article typically emphasizes mutual respect and trust. If one partner is repeatedly doubting the other without cause, that's a problem. The author isn't hiding anything; he's transparent about his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions could be undermining the trust in the relationship. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He has the right to be upset about being disbelieved and having his privacy invaded. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
