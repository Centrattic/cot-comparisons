Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being angry at their girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality in the past but generally doesn't mind. The main issue here is that his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, has repeatedly questioned his sexuality, even checking his porn history. The author feels frustrated because he's stated he's straight, and she's not taking that at face value. He's upset that he has to \"defend\" his sexuality, especially in 2019, and he feels it's hypocritical given his girlfriend's bisexuality.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay because of the initial sexual performance issue. That's a bit concerning because it's not a valid reason to assume someone's sexuality. Sexual performance can be due to various factors, not necessarily related to orientation. The girlfriend then took it upon herself to question him multiple times and even checked his porn history. That's an invasion of privacy and not a healthy way to approach a relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration seems justified. No one should have to defend their sexuality, especially if they've clearly stated their orientation. The girlfriend's actions imply a lack of trust and respect. The author is right to feel upset about being questioned repeatedly despite asserting his sexuality. It's important for partners to trust each other's self-identification without unnecessary suspicion.\n\nBut wait, could the author be overreacting? Maybe he was initially nervous, and the girlfriend was trying to understand. However, multiple times and checking his history is excessive. The fact that she shared his issue with a friend also indicates a breach of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to being treated as untrustworthy and not being believed, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of hypocrisy, since his girlfriend is bi, she should understand the importance of respecting someone's self-identified orientation. If she's bi, she might have experienced similar doubts from others. The author's point about LGBTQ+ people facing challenges is valid; expecting someone to keep proving their orientation is outdated.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. The author's frustration is a valid response to being questioned repeatedly and having his privacy invaded. Answer B.\n"
