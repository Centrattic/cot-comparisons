Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual girlfriend. He mentions that he's been asked about his sexuality before but didn't mind. However, his girlfriend started doubting him after a nervous encounter during sex, which led her to question him multiple times, even checking his porn history. The author feels frustrated and says that if he were gay, he would be comfortable with it now, and he finds it hypocritical since his girlfriend is bisexual.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. Trust is crucial. If the girlfriend is not respecting the author's self-identification, that's a problem. The fact that she searched through his porn history without his consent is a violation of privacy. That's a red flag regardless of the situation. The author is within his right to be upset about being questioned repeatedly after he's already stated his sexuality. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend has her reasons, like past experiences or personal insecurities. But even then, the method of checking his history without permission is wrong. The author's frustration is valid because he's being forced to defend his identity, which can be exhausting and hurtful. \n\nAlso, the timing is in 2019, so societal norms might expect more acceptance. The author isn't part of the LGBTQ+ community, so the challenges they face aren't the same as his. The girlfriend's actions might stem from her own biases or misunderstandings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be trying to address her own anxieties, but the way she's doing it is inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset with someone who doesn't take his identity seriously and invades his privacy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions are intrusive and disrespectful, and the author has the right to feel frustrated.\n"
