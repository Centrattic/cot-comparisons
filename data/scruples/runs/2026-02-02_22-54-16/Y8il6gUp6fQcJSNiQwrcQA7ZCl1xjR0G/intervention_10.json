Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality before, but he's okay with explaining he's straight. The girlfriend, after some initial concerns from her friend, keeps asking him if he's gay. The author gets frustrated because he feels he doesn't have to defend his sexuality, especially since he's comfortable with it. The girlfriend even checked his porn history, which adds to his annoyance.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated questioning and the girlfriend's actions. The author is upset because he feels his self-identification is being doubted. The girlfriend's friend might have spread the doubt, leading to her continued questioning. The author is in a relationship with someone who is bisexual, so he might expect mutual respect and trust regarding their orientations. \n\nThe author's frustration is about being questioned repeatedly even after he's stated his sexuality. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. In modern relationships, trust is crucial. The author feels it's hypocritical because he's comfortable with his identity, and he doesn't understand why he has to keep defending it. The girlfriend's friend's role is also questionable if they're influencing her without valid reasons.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and mutual respect are important. If the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's stated identity, that's a problem. The author's reaction is a response to being questioned without cause, which can be valid. The girlfriend might need to reflect on why she's so insistent and if there's underlying insecurity or something else driving her behavior.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the girlfriend might have valid concerns, but the way she's handling it is problematic. If there's a pattern of distrust or if the author's initial hesitation during sex has led to her doubts, communication is key. But the author clearly states he's straight, so her continued questioning is unwarranted unless there's more context not mentioned.\n\nIn summary, the author's frustration is understandable. He's not obligated to defend his sexuality repeatedly, and the girlfriend's actions (like checking his history) are invasive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B.\n"
