Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the guy is straight, and his girlfriend is bi. He's been asked if he's gay before because he gives off a vibe, but he doesn't mind explaining he's straight. Now, his girlfriend started doubting him, even searching his porn history. He's frustrated because he's made his sexuality clear, and she's not taking him at his word. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand being in someone else's position.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. If someone has already stated their sexuality and the partner continues to question or verify it without trust, that's a red flag. The guy's frustration is valid because he shouldn't have to prove his sexuality repeatedly. However, the girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or past experiences. But regardless, respecting his boundaries and taking his word at face value is important. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like searching his phone, are invasive and breach trust. The author is upset because of her persistent doubt, which is understandable. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he has a right to be upset about being mistrusted despite his clear statements.\n"
