Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author identifies as heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past. He mentions that he doesn't mind answering, but it's frustrating now that his girlfriend keeps questioning him. The girlfriend, who is bisexual, got the idea from a friend after noticing his initial nervousness during sex. She even checked his porn history. The author feels it's 2019, so he should be comfortable with his sexuality and not have to defend it, especially since his girlfriend is bi. He's upset because he feels his statement of being straight isn't taken seriously.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel respected and not have his sexuality questioned repeatedly. Trust is important in a relationship, and constant questioning might indicate a lack of trust. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014like checking his porn history\u2014might stem from insecurity or her own experiences. Maybe her friend's influence is causing her to doubt him. \n\nBut the key point is that the author has already affirmed his sexuality, and the girlfriend isn't respecting his boundaries by continuing to question him. The author's frustration is valid because he shouldn't have to prove his sexuality, especially in a relationship where he's already committed. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as disrespectful and intrusive. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he's reacting to his girlfriend's persistent and intrusive behavior, he's not in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's feelings about it. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
