Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is heterosexual, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times before, which he doesn't mind, but his girlfriend keeps bringing it up. She even checked his porn history and asked again after he said he's straight. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially in 2019, and finds it hypocritical given his girlfriend's bi identity.\n\nNow, the key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. If someone has already stated their sexuality, repeated questioning can be seen as not respecting their answer. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might indicate a lack of trust. The author's frustration is understandable because he feels the need to defend his identity repeatedly, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her own insecurities or past experiences leading her to question. However, even if that's the case, the way she's approaching it is problematic. In a healthy relationship, partners should trust each other. Constant questioning without valid reason can erode trust.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. He has a right to be frustrated when his self-identified sexuality is not taken at face value. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's reaction. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
