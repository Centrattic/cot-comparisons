Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The situation is that the author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual, and she's asked if he's gay several times, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he's stated he's straight, and he feels she's not taking him seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has repeatedly stated his orientation, so if the girlfriend is still questioning it, that could be an issue of trust or insecurity. But is the author in the wrong for being upset about this? Well, he's expressing frustration at being made to defend his sexuality, which he feels is unnecessary given his girlfriend's own openness about being bi. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her reasons. If she's concerned about his hesitation during sex, maybe she's trying to understand or address his comfort level. However, repeatedly questioning and invading privacy (checking porn history) seems inappropriate regardless. \n\nThe author's annoyance is valid because being forced to defend one's identity can be stressful. The fact that he's stated his orientation multiple times and she still doubts him could indicate a lack of trust on her part. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I agree. The key points are that the author is clear about his sexuality, and the girlfriend's actions cross boundaries by not respecting his stated identity and invading privacy. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
