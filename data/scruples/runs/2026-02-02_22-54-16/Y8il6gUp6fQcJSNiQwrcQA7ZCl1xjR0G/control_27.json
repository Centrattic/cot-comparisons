Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend has repeatedly asked him if he's gay, even checking his porn history, which made him frustrated. He's upset because he thinks he's being asked unnecessarily and that his statement of being straight isn't being taken seriously.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is annoyed because his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality despite him stating he's straight. He feels it's 2019 and that people should be past needing to question others' sexuality. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be seeking reassurance because of the initial hesitation during sex and maybe some advice from her friend. Her actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive but perhaps stem from insecurity or lack of trust.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and respect. The author's frustration is understandable if he feels his sexuality is being doubted without valid reason. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014like searching through his phone\u2014could indicate a lack of trust, which is problematic in a relationship. It's important to consider healthy communication. If the author had expressed his feelings of being disrespected when she asked repeatedly, maybe she could have adjusted. But he did get mad, which is a natural reaction to being questioned repeatedly without being believed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own insecurities, especially if she's bisexual and has had experiences where her partner's sexuality was questioned. However, she should respect his boundaries and not invade his privacy. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the constant questioning and the privacy violation. He's not obligated to prove his sexuality to her. So, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
