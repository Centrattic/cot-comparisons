Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. The girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. The author is getting frustrated because he feels he should be taken at his word and doesn't want to have to constantly defend his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has told his girlfriend he's straight multiple times, but she still asks again and again. Maybe she's having trust issues or is insecure? But the author feels it's unnecessary and hypocritical, especially since his girlfriend is bisexual. The girlfriend even checked his porn history, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. That seems like a red flag because people shouldn't have to prove their sexuality like that.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has reasons for her doubts. Insecurity in relationships can lead to such behavior. However, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality after they've already provided answers can be hurtful and not respectful. The author is within his right to be upset if his trust is being undermined.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he doesn't mind being asked before, but in this case, it's coming from his partner, which adds another layer. A healthy relationship should involve mutual trust and respect. If the girlfriend can't take his word for it, that's a problem. The author isn't the one being unfaithful or hiding something; he's just being asked to confirm his sexuality repeatedly without valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The responsibility lies with the girlfriend for not respecting his self-identification. The answer should be B.\n"
