Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's straight and has been asked this question before without issue. Now, his girlfriend, who is bisexual, has come to doubt his sexuality. The initial reason was his nervousness during sex, which he attributes to being new to the relationship. She then discussed it with a friend, who suggested it might mean he's gay. The author has already confirmed he's straight, but she keeps questioning him, even checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly, which he finds hypocritical given his girlfriend's own identity.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated questioning despite the author stating he's straight, invasion of privacy (checking his porn history), and the emotional toll. The author feels disrespected and not taken seriously. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or her own biases, but the author has a right to feel upset about being doubted and having his privacy invaded.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend's role is also a point. She's giving her friend the idea that he's gay, which isn't helpful. The author is in a position where his truth is being questioned, which can be hurtful. Given that the author is being asked about his sexuality multiple times and his privacy is being invaded, it's reasonable for him to feel angry. The girlfriend should respect his sexuality as he states it. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being disbelieved and having his privacy breached. So, the answer should be B.\n"
