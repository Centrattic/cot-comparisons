Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is heterosexual, his girlfriend is bisexual. She's asked him multiple times if he's gay, even after he said he's straight. The girlfriend got the idea from another friend after an initial problem during sex. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he states his sexuality, especially in 2019. He feels it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should understand the importance of trust and acceptance.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. The girlfriend's repeated questioning despite the author's assertions could indicate a lack of trust. The author's frustration seems valid because he's being asked to continually justify something he's already stated. The girlfriend's friend's role in spreading the idea that he might be gay complicates things further. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's anger stems from not being trusted. The girlfriend might have her reasons, like past experiences or insecurity, but repeatedly bringing it up without respecting his statement is an issue. The author isn't denying his sexuality, just being honest. The girlfriend should respect his identity and not make him prove it. \n\nAlso, considering societal norms in 2019, the author's point about being past such doubts is valid. If someone is in a relationship, trust is crucial. The girlfriend's actions might be undermining that trust. The fact that she searched his phone is a red flag for privacy invasion, which adds to the problem.\n\nSo, the author's reaction is understandable. He's not in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly despite clear communication. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
