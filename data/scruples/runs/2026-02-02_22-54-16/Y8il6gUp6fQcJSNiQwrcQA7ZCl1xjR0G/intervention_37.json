Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their girlfriend for repeatedly asking if they're gay. The author is straight, and the girlfriend, who is bisexual, seems to have doubts based on some initial sexual performance issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly stating they're straight, but the girlfriend keeps questioning it. The girlfriend even checked the author's porn history, which is pretty invasive. The author feels frustrated because they're not being taken at face value. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is heterosexual and has been asked about their sexuality multiple times in the past. The girlfriend's friend suggested the author might be gay after the author had some initial sexual difficulties. The girlfriend, influenced by this, keeps asking, which the author finds annoying and unfair. \n\nThe author feels it's hypocritical of the girlfriend, given that she's bi, to not take their sexuality seriously. They mention that if they were gay, they'd be comfortable with it by now. The situation is making the author defensive and frustrated.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is important. If the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's self-identification and is acting on rumors or her friend's advice, that's a problem. The fact that she searched through the author's private data (porn history) without consent is a major privacy violation. That alone could be a red flag in the relationship.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns. If she has a history of being with someone who was closeted, she might have insecurity issues. But even so, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality after they've stated it clearly can be hurtful. The author has a right to feel that their identity is being doubted, which can lead to resentment.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're not the one coming out; they're being accused of something they don't identify with. The girlfriend's actions could be based on her own insecurities or lack of trust. But the way she's handling it\u2014without open communication and by invading privacy\u2014is definitely wrong.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The author is defending their identity, which is valid. The girlfriend should address her own insecurities without making the author feel like they have to prove their sexuality repeatedly.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
