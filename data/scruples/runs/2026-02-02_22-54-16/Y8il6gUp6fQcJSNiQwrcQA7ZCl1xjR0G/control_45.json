Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He's been asked if he's gay before, and he doesn't mind telling others he's straight. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, keeps doubting his sexuality, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he has to defend his straightness, especially since he's not in the LGBTQ+ community and he thinks it's hypocritical of her to not take his word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior of repeatedly questioning and even checking his porn history seems invasive and disrespectful. Trust is a key component in any relationship, and if one partner doesn't trust the other's self-identified sexuality without evidence, that's a problem. The author has clearly stated he's straight, so her continued doubt might be based on her own insecurities or the friend's influence, which isn't his fault.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because no one should have to constantly prove their sexuality, especially when it's self-identified. The fact that he's not part of the LGBTQ+ community and is heterosexual, yet still faces these questions, shows that the issue lies with the girlfriend's lack of trust. The girlfriend's friend also plays a role here by spreading doubts without cause.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship that's causing her to question him, like past experiences or other insecurities. But the scenario doesn't mention any such history. The author has given clear answers, so the problem seems to be her not respecting his self-identification.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's actions, searching through his porn history is a privacy violation, which is definitely wrong. The author being upset about that is justified. The fact that she keeps bringing it up months later shows she's not taking his answers seriously, which can lead to resentment. The author isn't the one making unfounded accusations; he's reacting to her repeated doubts.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His frustration stems from being disrespected and not trusted in his own identity. The girlfriend's actions are the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
