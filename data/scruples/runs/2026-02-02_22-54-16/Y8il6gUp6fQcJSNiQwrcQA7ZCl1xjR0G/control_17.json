Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual male in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. He's been asked about his sexuality in the past, which he's okay with answering. However, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, has started questioning him multiple times, including checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he's clear about being straight and feels he shouldn't have to defend it repeatedly. He's upset that his girlfriend isn't taking his word for it, which he sees as hypocritical, especially since she's bi and should be more accepting.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Trust is a big part of relationships. If the girlfriend doesn't trust her partner's self-identification, that's an issue. The author isn't hiding anything; he's upfront about his sexuality. The fact that she's checking his porn history is invasive and suggests a lack of trust. The author's frustration is valid because being asked repeatedly without trust can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend's role here might indicate that she's being influenced by someone else's opinion instead of trusting her partner. The author's reaction to being annoyed is understandable. He doesn't owe anyone repeated validation of his sexuality, especially if he's not in the LGBTQ+ community and doesn't face the same coming-out struggles. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a communication issue. The girlfriend might have her own insecurities or misunderstandings. But the responsibility isn't on the author to accommodate that by being defensive. The main issue here is the lack of trust and respect from the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend needs to respect his identity without needing constant proof. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
