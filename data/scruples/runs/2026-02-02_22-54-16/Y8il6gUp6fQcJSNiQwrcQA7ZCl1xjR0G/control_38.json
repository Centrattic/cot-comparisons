Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is heterosexual, his girlfriend is bisexual, and she's been asking him if he's gay multiple times, even checking his porn history. He's upset because he feels he shouldn't have to defend his sexuality, especially since she's bi and should be more accepting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to feel frustrated if someone he trusts keeps doubting his identity. It's important to respect his self-identification as straight. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons, maybe insecurity or past experiences, but repeatedly questioning and invading privacy (like checking porn history) isn't healthy. The author's anger is a valid reaction to being disrespected and not believed. The key points are trust, respect, and communication. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as controlling or not trusting him, which is a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
