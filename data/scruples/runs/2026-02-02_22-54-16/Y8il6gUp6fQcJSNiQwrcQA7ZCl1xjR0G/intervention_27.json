Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The situation involves the girlfriend suspecting he's gay based on initial nervousness during sex and a friend's suggestion. The author feels it's frustrating to have to repeatedly confirm his heterosexuality, especially since he's in a bi relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior seems to stem from insecurity or curiosity, maybe influenced by her own friend's input. The author is clear about his sexuality but feels disrespected by her constant questioning. It's important to note that everyone has the right to their own sexuality and not be doubted without reason. The girlfriend's actions might be a form of control or lack of trust, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. Being made to defend one's identity repeatedly can be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions don't seem to respect his self-identification. The fact that the author is open about his sexuality and the girlfriend still questions it shows a lack of trust. The key point is that the author is being accused of being AITA (Ask the Adults) for being mad, but his frustration is valid. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not his reaction to it. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
