Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. \n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He mentions that he's been asked if he's gay before, which he doesn't mind answering, but his girlfriend keeps questioning him. He got annoyed because she even checked his porn history, and he feels like he should be taken at his word when he says he's straight. He thinks it's hypocritical since she's bi and in 2019, people should be past needing constant confirmation.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: the girlfriend's repeated questioning despite the author stating he's straight. The author is frustrated because he's not being believed, and he's angry about the invasion of privacy (checking his porn history). The girlfriend might be insecure or have trust issues. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel frustrated if his sexuality is being doubted without reason. However, maybe the girlfriend's behavior stems from her own insecurities or past experiences. But the problem here is that the author is being asked repeatedly, which could indicate a lack of trust. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend told her friend, who suggested he's gay. That might have been based on the nervousness during sex. But the author says that's resolved now. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly. The girlfriend's actions might be insensitivity or lack of trust. The author is justified in feeling that he should be believed when he states his sexuality. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
