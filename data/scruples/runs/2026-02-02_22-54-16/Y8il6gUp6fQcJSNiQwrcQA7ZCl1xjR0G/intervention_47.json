Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for getting mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man is straight, identifies as heterosexual. His girlfriend, who is bisexual, has questioned his sexuality multiple times, leading to frustration. He mentions that he's been asked if he's gay before, but usually doesn't mind. However, in this relationship, the repeated questioning and even checking his porn history have made him upset. He feels that since he's already stated he's straight, she doesn't take him seriously and it's frustrating. He also points out that he's in 2019, suggesting he thinks this shouldn't be an issue anymore.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend's behavior could stem from insecurity or curiosity. She might be trying to validate her own feelings or address her own insecurities in the relationship. However, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality, especially after they've clarified it, can come off as distrustful or dismissive. The fact that she even checked his porn history is a major red flag. Privacy invasion like that is generally not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. Being made to repeatedly defend one's identity, even if it's a common experience for LGBTQ+ individuals, is different when the person in question is heterosexual and has already communicated their stance. There's a double standard here. The girlfriend is making him feel like he needs to prove his heterosexuality, which can be just as invalidating as someone trying to deny a person's LGBTQ+ identity. The author is right to feel that if he were gay, he'd be open about it, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the girlfriend might have her own reasons. Maybe she's dealing with her own insecurities because of her bisexuality, or she's trying to process her own feelings about the relationship. But regardless of her motivations, her actions are crossing boundaries. The repeated questioning and invasion of privacy are not healthy. The author has every right to be upset about being treated with a lack of trust and respect.\n\nThe user mentioned that the author is not in the wrong, and I agree. The girlfriend and her friend's continued questioning and invasive behavior are the issues here. The author's anger is a reasonable response to being made to feel that his identity isn't taken at face value. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
