Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and has been asked about his sexuality multiple times in different contexts. He doesn't mind answering, but with his girlfriend, it's become an issue. She initially got the idea from a friend after noticing some nervousness during sex. The author explained he's straight, but she continued to question him, even checking his porn history. He's frustrated because he feels he needs to defend his sexuality, especially since his girlfriend is bisexual and he thinks they should be past such doubts.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to feel comfortable in his identity. Being repeatedly questioned about something fundamental like sexuality can be hurtful and frustrating. The girlfriend's actions, like searching through his porn history, might be an invasion of privacy. The fact that the author is heterosexual and has stated it clearly could mean he's in the right to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be dealing with her own insecurities or lack of trust. Maybe her bisexuality makes her more sensitive to such issues, or she's had past experiences where she wasn't believed. However, her actions in checking his history and repeated questioning could be seen as not respecting his boundaries.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to not be doubted about his sexuality and the girlfriend's behavior that's causing this conflict. The author's frustration is valid because he's stating his identity clearly and finding it tiring to have to defend it. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nIn terms of societal context, the author mentions it's 2019, implying that societal acceptance should be higher. If someone is openly and confidently stating their sexuality, others should respect that. The girlfriend's persistent doubt could be seen as a lack of trust, which is a problem in the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The responsibility lies more with the girlfriend for not respecting his stated identity and invading his privacy. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
