Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly asking if he's gay. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, and his girlfriend is bisexual. He says he's been asked about his sexuality before but usually doesn't mind. However, since their relationship started, the girlfriend has questioned his sexuality multiple times, even checking his porn history. The author is frustrated because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially in 2019, and finds it hypocritical given his girlfriend is bi. He's annoyed and wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's being asked repeatedly despite clearly stating he's straight. This could be a trust issue. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and if the girlfriend isn't respecting his statement, that's a problem. However, maybe there's an underlying reason for her suspicion. The author mentioned nervousness during sex initially. Could that be causing her doubt? Maybe she's insecure or has trust issues. But if she's basing it on something like porn history searches, that's an invasion of privacy and could be problematic.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, if she's doing this out of concern or curiosity, but in a way that invades his privacy and repeats the question despite his answers, that's not healthy. However, if she has a legitimate reason to be uncertain, like the initial issue with performance, but then continues to question him without addressing that, it's not fair. Also, the fact that she told a friend, who then suggested he might be gay, might indicate a lack of trust in the relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being forced to repeatedly defend one's sexuality can be exhausting, especially if it's clear. However, communication is key. Maybe the author didn't address her concerns when they first came up. If she's worried about his sexuality, perhaps there's another underlying issue she's not addressing. But it's also about mutual respect. If he's being asked again and again, and she's checking his phone, that's a breach of trust and respect on her part.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, 2019 was a time when acceptance of LGBTQ+ was more prevalent, so the author's point about being comfortable with his sexuality if he were gay might hold some weight. However, everyone's experience is different. But the repeated questioning without valid cause seems to be the issue here.\n\nThe key points are trust, communication, and respect. The girlfriend's actions (searching his phone, repeated questioning) are issues. The author's frustration is valid because he's being asked to defend his sexuality unnecessarily. However, the author could have addressed her concerns earlier. Maybe he didn't explain why he's straight, or he didn't confront her about the phone issue. But given that she's continued despite his answers, the responsibility might lie more with her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he got angry because she's not respecting his statement, then he's not in the wrong. However, if his anger is because he doesn't want to discuss it and she's trying to understand, maybe there's a communication gap. But based on the scenario, the girlfriend is overstepping by not taking his word and invading his privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Answer B.\n"
