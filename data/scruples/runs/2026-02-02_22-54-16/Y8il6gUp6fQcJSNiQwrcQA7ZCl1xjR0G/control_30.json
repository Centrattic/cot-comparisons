Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual girlfriend. She keeps questioning his sexuality, even after he's told her he's straight. He's getting annoyed because he feels like he has to defend his sexuality repeatedly, especially considering he's been asked before in other contexts but it's not a big deal. The girlfriend's friend even suggested he might be gay, leading her to search his porn history to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has clearly stated his sexuality, yet the girlfriend continues to doubt him. That seems like a breach of trust. If someone keeps questioning a partner's sexuality despite being told otherwise, that could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that she told a friend about his sexual performance and then the friend spread doubts might contribute to the problem. But the girlfriend is also the one persistently bringing it up again and again.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He mentions that he's been in situations before where people asked about his sexuality, but he didn't mind because he just told them he's straight. Now, in a trusting relationship, he feels the need to constantly reaffirm his sexuality, which is frustrating. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, are invasive and could indicate a lack of trust. That's a red flag in any relationship.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. The girlfriend is bisexual, so perhaps her questioning is stemming from her own insecurities or experiences. However, even if that's the case, repeatedly doubting her partner's identity that he's already confirmed isn't healthy. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and if the girlfriend isn't respecting the author's stated sexuality, that's a problem.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being questioned repeatedly. If a partner doesn't take you at face value regarding something as personal as sexuality, that's a sign of deeper issues in the relationship. The girlfriend's actions seem controlling and disrespectful. The fact that she told a friend about their private moments and then let that friend influence her opinion is also problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's justified in being upset because his sexuality has already been stated and confirmed. The fact that she continues to question him without believing him is the problem. The answer should be B.\n"
