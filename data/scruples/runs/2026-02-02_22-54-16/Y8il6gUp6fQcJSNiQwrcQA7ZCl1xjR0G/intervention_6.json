Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times before but usually answers without issue. However, after some initial sexual performance anxiety, his girlfriend started questioning him again. She even checked his porn history, which is a privacy issue. The author is frustrated because he's given his answer and feels he should be taken at his word.\n\nNow, considering the context: The girlfriend's friend suggested he might be gay based on his nervousness during sex. The girlfriend then repeated the questioning, which the author finds frustrating. The author is upset because he feels he's being accused of lying about his sexuality despite stating he's straight. He mentions that it's 2019 and he should be comfortable with his identity by now, so the constant questioning is unnecessary.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is key. If the girlfriend doesn't believe the author's self-identification, that's a problem. The act of checking his porn history is a breach of trust and privacy. The author has every right to be upset about being disrespected and not being taken seriously. The girlfriend's actions suggest a lack of trust, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend has her own reasons for the insecurity, like past experiences or personal biases. But the author's frustration is valid. He shouldn't have to repeatedly justify his sexuality, especially when he's already stated it clearly. The girlfriend's actions are intrusive and disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while LGBTQ+ individuals often face challenges, the author is heterosexual and feels marginalized here. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue, not the author's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
