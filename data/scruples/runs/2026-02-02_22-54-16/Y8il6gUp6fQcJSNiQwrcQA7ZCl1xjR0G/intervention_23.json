Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, the girlfriend is bisexual. The main issue is that the girlfriend has asked multiple times if he's gay, even checking his porn history. The author feels frustrated because he's being forced to defend his sexuality despite stating he's straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend initially thought he might be gay because of his nervousness during sex, which she discussed with a friend. Then she kept questioning him, which he found tiring. The author is upset that his declaration of being straight isn't trusted, especially in 2019 when LGBTQ+ issues are more accepted. He also points out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend is bi but doesn't face similar scrutiny about her sexuality.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, if one partner repeatedly questions the other's sexuality despite being told explicitly, that's a problem. Trust and respect are key in a relationship. The author feels his identity is being doubted, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions, like checking his porn history, might be seen as invasive and disrespectful. It's important to consider why she's doing this\u2014maybe insecurity or lack of trust. However, the author has a right to feel frustrated when his words aren't taken at face value. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect. The author should communicate his feelings calmly and ask for her trust. If she's not respecting his boundaries or his honesty, that's a red flag. The friend's role in perpetuating the doubt also adds to the issue. The author isn't the one causing the problem; he's reacting to ongoing questioning without valid reasons. \n\nIn terms of societal context, the author is correct that in 2019, one should be comfortable with their sexuality. However, everyone's journey is different, and some people might have legitimate reasons to question their sexuality. But in this case, the author is clear he's straight, and the girlfriend isn't respecting that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. His frustration is justified. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. He's not the one at fault for being upset about repeated questioning and lack of trust. The correct answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
