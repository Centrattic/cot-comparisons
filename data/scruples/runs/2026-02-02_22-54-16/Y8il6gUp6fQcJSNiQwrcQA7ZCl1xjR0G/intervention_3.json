Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man in a relationship with a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times before, but here the key issue is the girlfriend's repeated questioning. The author explains that her questioning started after some initial nervousness during sex, and she even checked his porn history. The author feels it's frustrating to have to defend his heterosexuality, especially since he's comfortable with it and the girlfriend is bi, so he expects her to be more accepting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's behavior could stem from insecurity or mistrust, perhaps due to her own bisexual identity or past experiences. However, repeatedly questioning someone's sexuality, especially after they've stated their orientation, can be seen as invalidating their identity. The author is within his right to feel upset about being doubted, especially since he's not part of the LGBTQ+ community and thus not facing the same societal pressures when coming out. \n\nThe girlfriend might have her own reasons, like anxiety about the relationship or her own biases, but that doesn't justify the repeated questioning. The author's frustration is valid because he's being made to defend his sexuality unnecessarily. It's important in relationships to respect each other's identities without constant doubt. The author's stance that he's not in the wrong seems justified here because the onus shouldn't be on him to convince her of his orientation when he's already stated it clearly. So, the answer is B.\n"
