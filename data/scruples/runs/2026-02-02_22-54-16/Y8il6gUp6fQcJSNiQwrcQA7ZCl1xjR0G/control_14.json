Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his girlfriend keeps questioning his sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a heterosexual male dating a bisexual woman. He's been asked about his sexuality multiple times in the past, but he's never minded explaining he's straight. Now, his girlfriend, influenced by a friend, is repeatedly asking him if he's gay. He's getting annoyed because he feels he should be believed when he says he's straight, especially since he's a heterosexual man, and he's frustrated that she's not taking him at his word.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the girlfriend's repeated questioning despite him stating he's straight, her friend's influence, and the author's frustration over being made to \"defend\" his sexuality. The author feels it's hypocritical because he's in a heterosexual relationship and doesn't see why his orientation is under scrutiny.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend might be trying to understand or address her own insecurities, perhaps from past experiences or her own orientation. The fact that she's bisexual might make her more open to different possibilities, but that doesn't necessarily justify her doubting him. \n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable. No one should have to constantly prove their sexuality, especially if they're confident in their identity. However, communication is key in relationships. If the girlfriend has valid concerns (maybe from his past behavior or her own experiences), she should express them openly rather than repeatedly questioning him. \n\nBut the author is also in a position where he's being asked to explain himself. The girlfriend's actions might stem from insecurity or a need for reassurance. However, repeatedly questioning could be seen as a lack of trust. The author's frustration is valid because trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. \n\nThe fact that she looked into his porn history is a red flag. That's an invasion of privacy and not something a healthy relationship should involve. The author is right to be upset about that. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he expressed his feelings and got angry. If he communicated his frustration calmly, that's different. If he was dismissive of her concerns without understanding the root cause, that could be a problem. However, based on the scenario, it seems the girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility lies more with the girlfriend to respect his stated sexuality and not repeatedly question him. The author's frustration is a reasonable response to being disbelieved and having his privacy invaded.\n"
