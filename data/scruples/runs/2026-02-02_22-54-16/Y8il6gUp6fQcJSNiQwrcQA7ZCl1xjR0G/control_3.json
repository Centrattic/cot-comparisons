Throughout my life I\u2019ve been asked  if I\u2019m gay several times, at school, at work, to friends. I don\u2019t mind telling people that I\u2019m straight, I guess I give off a vibe that I\u2019m gay, it\u2019s no big deal I don\u2019t mind. Usually nobody questions it. \n\nSo I started dating my girlfriend about about 5 months ago and she got the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay.  When we first started dating I got a little nervous during sex and had trouble climaxing, hasn\u2019t been much of an issue since then. She told one of her friends about it and she gave her the idea that maybe I\u2019m gay. She asked me and I told her that I\u2019m actually straight. Well since then she\u2019s questioned me several times about it. Once she even searched through my porn history to confirm that I\u2019m not watching gay porn. Well it\u2019s been couple months and today she asked me again if I was gay and told me that if I was then she\u2019d want to know. I got pretty annoyed because this is getting old. \n\nLook it\u2019s 2019, and if I was gay i really feel like id be comfortable with it by now, I understand homosexual people have a lot of challenges coming out, but I feel like I have to defend my sexuality to my girlfriend and it\u2019s frustrating that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I say that I\u2019m straight. I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical that I\u2019m not taken seriously when I tell her that I\u2019m in to women. I understand this has happened to LGBTQ+ people in the past but that seems like something we should be past by now, especially considering my girlfriend is bi. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend and her friend who doesn\u2019t accept that I\u2019m straight.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at his girlfriend for repeatedly questioning his sexuality. The author is straight, his girlfriend is bisexual. She started questioning his sexuality after he had some initial performance issues during sex, which he's since resolved. She even checked his porn history, and now she's asking again. The author feels frustrated because he's been clear he's straight, and he thinks it's hypocritical since his girlfriend is bi and should be more accepting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: maybe she's worried about the relationship? If he had trouble during sex, maybe she's confused or insecure. But then again, repeatedly questioning his sexuality even after he's confirmed it seems unnecessary. The author is getting annoyed because he's had to defend his sexuality multiple times, which isn't a situation he wanted. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. If the author has been honest about his sexuality, then the girlfriend's continued questioning might be a sign of underlying issues in the relationship. The author isn't wrong for feeling annoyed because he's had to explain himself so much. However, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for being insecure, maybe stemming from her own experiences or her friend's influence.\n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The girlfriend should respect his self-identification. It's 2019, so the premise that someone would need to prove their heterosexuality in a relationship like this is a bit outdated. The fact that she's checking his porn history is a bit invasive and possibly a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's performance issues caused some initial concern, that's a valid reason for her to have questions. But after multiple confirmations, it's about trust. The author might need to have a deeper conversation with his girlfriend about why she's still doubting him. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad. \n\nGiven that the author is making a valid point about needing to be taken at his word, especially in a relationship where his girlfriend is part of the LGBTQ+ community, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (checking porn history, repeated questioning) are problematic, and the author's frustration is justified. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
