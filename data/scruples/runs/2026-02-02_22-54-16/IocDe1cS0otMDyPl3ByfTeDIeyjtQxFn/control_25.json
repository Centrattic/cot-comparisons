For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The roommates are a married couple, and the author mentions that they're all temporarily living in one room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, as stated in the edit. Wait, that's a key detail. The original question is from the perspective of a 6-week-old baby. But the initial scenario is presented as if the author is an adult. Wait, hold on\u2014there's a contradiction here. The original post says the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby,\" but the question is phrased as if the author is an adult making decisions about waking up roommates. That seems confusing. Maybe it's a typo or a misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal edit says: \"State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents.\" So the author is a baby, and the roommates are their parents. But the initial scenario is written from the baby's perspective, asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their parents (the roommates) for a snack. That's a different situation than if the author were an adult.\n\nSo, the question is whether a baby is in the wrong for waking up their parents for food. But a baby can't be in the wrong because they're too young to understand social norms. However, the parents are the ones who have to manage their rest. But the parents aren't working, so maybe they can handle the baby's needs. The original post mentions that the parents aren't working, so waking them up for a snack isn't affecting their work. \n\nBut the question is framed as an adult's dilemma. Wait, maybe there's a miscommunication here. If the author is a baby, then the situation is normal parenting\u2014feeding the baby. But the way the question is phrased is as if the author is an adult making a choice. Maybe the edit is clarifying that the author is a baby, which changes the dynamic. \n\nIn that case, the parents are the ones who need to accommodate the baby's needs. So technically, the baby isn't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No). However, if the author were an adult, the answer might be different. But given the edit clarifies the author is a baby, the answer is B. The parents are responsible for taking care of the baby's needs, even if it means being woken up at night. So the baby isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
