For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original situation mentions that the roommates are a married couple, and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, so they can't actually be making decisions here. The parents are the ones involved.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning is that the author isn't in the wrong. The key points here are the author being a baby and the parents not working, so they can sleep in. The main issue is the baby's need to eat. Since the baby can't access snacks on their own, they have to wake the parents. However, since the parents are the ones providing care, it's part of their responsibility. But the question is phrased as the author (the baby) being the one waking them up, which is a bit odd because a baby can't do that intentionally. Maybe the parents are the ones giving the baby a snack, hence waking up. But the edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby, so they're not making a choice here. The parents might be the ones in the situation of having to wake up to feed the baby, but the original post seems to present the baby as the one in the wrong, which doesn't make sense. \n\nThe parents aren't working, so their schedule is more flexible. The baby's needs take priority, especially since they need to eat every few hours. In that context, waking up for the baby is part of parenting. The question might be a bit of a trick because the author is a baby, so they can't be wrong. The answer should be No, the author isn't in the wrong because they're a baby and their needs are the parents' responsibility. The parents are the ones who have to adjust their sleep for the baby's feeding schedule. So the answer is B.\n"
