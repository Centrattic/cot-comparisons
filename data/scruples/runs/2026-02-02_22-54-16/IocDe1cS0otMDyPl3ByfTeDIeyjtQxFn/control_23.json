For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is a 6-week-old newborn, lives with their parents (the married couple) in a two-bedroom apartment where they're temporarily all sleeping in one room. The author gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs to wake up their parent to get a snack, which also ends up waking the other parent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this every night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their need for frequent feeding is biological and necessary for survival and health. Newborns typically need to eat every 2-3 hours, so waking up multiple times at night is normal. However, the parents are also not working, so maybe they can adjust their sleep schedule. But the parents might be tired from caring for a newborn and getting little sleep. The situation is temporary, as the author mentions it's a temporary arrangement for some reasons (maybe moving out soon? Or living together for a specific period?).\n\nThe parents might be frustrated because they can't sleep through the night. However, considering the baby's needs are essential, it's unlikely that the baby is at fault. The parents might have expected this when having a newborn, and it's part of parenting. The fact that the baby is in Massachusetts doesn't seem to affect the moral judgment here, unless there are specific laws or cultural norms, but the question is more about right and wrong rather than legal aspects.\n\nBut wait, the original scenario was presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question. The key factors are: the baby's basic needs, the parents' ability to handle the situation, and whether the baby has any control over their actions. Since the baby is a newborn, they can't help needing to eat at night. Therefore, the parents should be expected to care for the baby's needs, even if it means waking up. The baby isn't making a choice to wake them; it's a natural process of growth and development. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I didn't misinterpret the original question. The user edited the post to clarify that the author is a newborn. In the initial version, the author was just a person, which would have been a different scenario. But with the edit, it's clear that the author is an infant, making the situation about parenting responsibilities. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
