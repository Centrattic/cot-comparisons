For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is a bit specific. The person is a newborn, so that's important. The roommates are their parents, and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nThe user is a baby, so they can't really be expected to get a snack on their own. The parents have the snacks, and the baby needs to eat at night. But waking up parents every night at 3 AM for a snack... Hmm. Well, babies do need to eat frequently, especially in the early weeks. However, the parents might be exhausted from lack of sleep. But the edit clarifies that the author is a baby, so the question is a bit of a joke scenario. \n\nIn reality, if a newborn is hungry, the parents are supposed to feed them whenever needed. But the scenario is presented as a serious question. The parents are the roommates, so maybe they're being asked to take care of the baby's needs. The author is a baby, so they can't be blamed for needing to eat. However, the way the question is framed makes me think it's a humorous take. The answer would probably be B, No, because the baby isn't at fault. The parents are supposed to attend to their baby's needs. Even though the parents might be tired, the baby's needs come first. So the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
