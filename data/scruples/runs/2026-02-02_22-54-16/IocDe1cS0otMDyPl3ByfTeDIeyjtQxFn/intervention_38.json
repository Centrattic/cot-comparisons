For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for waking their roommates up for a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that they all live in a two-bedroom apartment, but temporarily are in one room. The roommates are a married couple, who are the user's parents, and the user is a 6-week-old baby. So, the baby needs a snack at 3 AM but can't access it without waking the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the person writing\u20146 weeks old? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" Oh, that's important. So the person is actually a baby. But the question is from an adult perspective, which is confusing. Wait, maybe the parents are the ones asking? No, the original post is from the baby's viewpoint? That's a bit odd. But since the edit clarifies that the author is a newborn, the parents are the roommates. \n\nSo, the baby needs to eat at 3 AM, but the parents are sleeping in the same room. The baby can't get the food without waking them up. The baby is hungry and would be cranky otherwise. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. \n\nIn this scenario, the baby isn't at fault because they can't help needing to eat. The parents might have to adjust to their baby's feeding schedule. Since the baby is a newborn, it's expected that feedings are frequent and at odd hours. The parents should be prepared for this as part of having a newborn. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended the author to be an adult, but the edit says the author is a baby. So the situation is the parents are being woken up by their baby for a snack. From a moral standpoint, the baby isn't to blame. The parents are responsible for caring for their child. So the answer is B.\n"
