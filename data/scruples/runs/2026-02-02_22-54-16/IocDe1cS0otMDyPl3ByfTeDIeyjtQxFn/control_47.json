For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. The key points here are: they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, the parents have the snacks, the baby can't access them otherwise, and the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The baby is only 6 weeks old, which means they have different needs compared to adults. Newborns have short sleep cycles and need to eat frequently. However, waking up parents every few hours might be challenging for them, even if they aren't working. But the parents are used to this phase since they have a newborn, so maybe it's part of the adjustment period.\n\nThe baby might not realize that waking the parents is an issue, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are the ones in charge of the baby's care, so they might have set up the situation knowing that the baby needs to eat at night. The parents should be aware that this is a temporary phase and that the baby's needs come first. \n\nAlso, the fact that the parents aren't working means they have more flexibility. They can adjust their sleep schedule to accommodate the baby's needs. The baby isn't doing this intentionally; it's a natural part of their development. The parents should be prepared for this and might even have strategies for feeding the baby without being fully awake, like keeping snacks accessible.\n\nHowever, if the parents are struggling with the frequent wake-ups, that's a different matter. But the question is whether the baby is in the wrong. Since the baby can't control their hunger or sleep patterns, it's not their fault. The parents, as caregivers, are expected to manage this situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
