For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are parents) for a 3 AM snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is a newborn, so maybe that affects things.\n\nFirst, the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author gets really hungry and becomes hangry if they wait. They have to wake one parent who has the snacks, and the other parent gets woken up too. The author is a baby, so maybe the parents are used to getting up for feedings. But this is about snacks, not feeding. However, the author is a newborn, so maybe they can't help their hunger cycles. \n\nBut wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. So the roommates are the parents. The parents have the snacks, and the baby needs to eat in the middle of the night. But as a baby, they can't get the snacks themselves. So the parents are already used to getting up for feedings. Maybe the baby is just doing what's necessary for nutrition. \n\nSince the parents aren't working, they can sleep in. The baby isn't in control of their hunger. The parents might not mind because they're used to getting up for the baby. But the question is about whether the author (the baby) is at fault. Since the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat, maybe the answer is B. The parents are the ones who have to take care of the baby's needs. \n\nBut wait, the original setup said the roommates are a married couple. Oh, but the edit clarifies that the author is a baby, so the roommates are actually the parents. So the baby is the one waking them up for snacks. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so it's their duty to tend to the baby's needs. Therefore, the baby isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
