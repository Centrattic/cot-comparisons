For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) at 3 AM every night for a snack. The key points here are that the person is a 6-week-old newborn, so they can't eat solid food. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they're a newborn, they can't be eating snacks. Maybe there's a translation error or a mistake in the edit. Oh, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the author is a baby.\n\nWait, but a 6-week-old baby can't be eating snacks at 3 AM. Infants typically feed on demand, usually with breast milk or formula. The situation mentions the parents have all the snacks, but the baby doesn't have access. Maybe they mean the baby is hungry and needs to be fed, but the parents are sleeping. But if the baby is a newborn, they would need to be fed by the parents, not take snacks. Maybe the terms are mixed up here.\n\nThe parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby is waking them up to eat, which is necessary for the baby's well-being. The parents might be upset because they're being disturbed, but for a newborn, feeding is crucial. However, a baby can't choose to wake up for a snack; they need to be fed. The original question is phrased as if the person is choosing to wake them up for a snack, but if they're a baby, they can't do that. There's a contradiction here. The answer depends on whether the person is an adult or a baby. If it's a baby, then they're not in the wrong because they're fulfilling a biological need. If it's an adult, then waking others up for snacks every night without considering alternatives might be inconsiderate. But the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because a baby can't be held responsible for needing to eat. The parents should adjust to the baby's needs. However, the original scenario mentions waking up for a snack, which is an adult term, not a baby. So there's confusion in the question. Maybe the user made a mistake in the edit. If the author is a baby, then the answer is B. If they're an adult using a baby as an excuse, then A. Given the edit states the author is a newborn, I have to consider that. So the answer is B.\n"
