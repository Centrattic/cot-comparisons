For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that the author is a newborn, living with their parents in a shared room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author says they get very hungry and cranky if they don't eat around 2-3 AM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they are a 6-week-old baby. Wait, that's a baby, so this situation is a bit different. The parents are the roommates, but the baby can't really be held responsible for their actions. However, maybe the question is from the parents' perspective, but the edit says the author is the baby. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the original Socratic situation is the user asking if they're in the wrong for waking roommates up, but the edit says the author is a newborn. That's confusing. How can a newborn be making this post? Maybe the parents are the ones posting on behalf of the baby, but that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a hypothetical scenario where the baby is the one doing the waking up. \n\nAssuming the baby is the one getting hungry and needing to wake up the parents, but a baby can't ask for a snack. So maybe the parents are being woken up by the baby's hunger, but that's natural. However, the question is framed as the author being the one waking them up. If the author is a newborn, then they can't be at fault because they're an infant. So the answer would be B (No), as the baby isn't in the wrong. But maybe the parents are the ones making the post, but the edit says the author is the baby. So the answer is B because the baby isn't responsible for needing to eat. The parents should just accommodate the baby's needs. So the author isn't in the wrong. Also, the parents aren't working, so they can handle the baby's feeding schedule. Hence, answer B.\n"
