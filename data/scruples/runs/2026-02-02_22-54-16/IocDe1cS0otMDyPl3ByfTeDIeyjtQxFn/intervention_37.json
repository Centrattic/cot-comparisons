For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a 3 AM snack. The author is a newborn, so that's a key detail. \n\nFirst, the situation: All three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents have all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking them up. The author gets very hungry at 2-3 AM and becomes \"hangry/cranky\" if they don't eat. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author is a baby, which changes things because infants have different needs.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, waking people up at night is usually frowned upon, especially if it's disruptive. But here, the author is a newborn. Newborns often wake up frequently for feeding, which is essential for their health and development. The parents already know this is part of having a baby, so the baby's needs take priority. \n\nThe parents might be adjusting their routine to care for the baby, which is part of parenting. Waking up for a baby's feeding is a normal part of early parenthood. Since the parents are not working, they have the flexibility to accommodate this. The author isn't at fault because they're an infant, and their needs are biological and necessary. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the author (a newborn) and the context of parental responsibilities. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The parents should understand that the baby's needs are crucial and that waking up for feedings is part of raising a newborn.\n"
