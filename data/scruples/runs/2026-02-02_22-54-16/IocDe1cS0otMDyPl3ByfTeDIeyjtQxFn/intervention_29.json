For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for waking up their roommates for a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that they're all temporarily sharing one room, and the author has to wake one of the roommates (who is the parent) to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author is a newborn, so maybe that's a key point.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break down the details. The author is a baby, so they can't control their hunger. The parents are roommates but also the baby's parents. The baby needs to eat when hungry, which is natural. The problem is waking them up at 3 AM. But since the parents aren't working, maybe it's not that big of a deal. Also, the baby can't help it. \n\nWait, the original question says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That's a baby, so the situation is different. Parents are used to being woken up for feeding their babies. Normally, parents don't mind being woken up for a hungry baby. So maybe the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong because it's the parents' responsibility to care for the baby's needs, even at night.\n\nBut wait, the original post mentions that the parents are roommates. Maybe there's some confusion here. If the parents are the roommates, then the baby is their child, and they should expect that the baby needs feedings during the night. So waking them up isn't really the baby's fault. The baby can't help it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nBut let me check again. The user edited the post to clarify that the state is MA and the author is a newborn. The married couple are the parents. So in that case, the parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care. Even though they're roommates, they're the parents, so the baby's needs take priority. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
