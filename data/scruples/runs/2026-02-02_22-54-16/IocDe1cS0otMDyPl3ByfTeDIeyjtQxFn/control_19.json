For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that all three are in one room, and the author, who's a newborn, needs snacks but can't access them without waking up the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author is a newborn. That's a crucial detail I might have missed initially. Newborns have different needs, especially regarding feeding. But wait, a newborn can't really be eating snacks. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo or a joke? Or maybe the author is metaphorically a baby in terms of being new to the situation? Hmm, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby, but the married couple are their parents. So the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates? That's confusing. Wait, no, the original question says the author is living with two roommates, a married couple. But then in the edit, the author clarifies that the roommates are their parents. So the author is a baby living with their parents in a temporary arrangement, all sleeping in one room. The baby needs to eat at 3 AM but can't access the snacks without waking the parents. \n\nIn that case, the parents are the ones who have the snacks, and the baby is waking them up for a snack. But a newborn can't exactly be eating snacks. Maybe it's about feeding the baby, like needing to eat, but the parents have the food stored somewhere else. The baby can't reach it, so they have to wake the parents. But since the baby is a newborn, they might be waking the parents up for feedings anyway. However, the question is phrased as waking them up for a snack, which might imply the baby is old enough for solid foods, but 6 weeks is very young. Maybe the parents are the ones needing the snack, but the baby is hungry. Wait, the original post says the author is the one who is hungry and needs a snack. But if the author is a baby, they would be nursing or formula feeding, not eating snacks. This seems contradictory. Maybe there's a mistake in the edit? Or maybe the author is a person who considers themselves a newborn in terms of being new to the situation. But that's probably not the case. \n\nAssuming the edit is correct and the author is a real newborn, then the parents are the ones who need to feed the baby. If the baby is waking up hungry at 3 AM, that's normal for a newborn. But the parents are the ones who have the snacks (maybe formula or food for the baby?), and the baby can't access them without waking the parents. But if the baby is waking the parents up for feedings, that's typical. However, the question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. But a baby can't be in the wrong. The real issue might be the parents' ability to manage their own rest and the baby's feeding needs. Since the parents aren't working and can sleep in, maybe the baby's feeding schedule is manageable. However, if the baby is waking them up every night, it's part of parenting. The parents might have to adjust, but the baby isn't at fault. \n\nWait, but the question is framed as \"AITA for waking my roommates up for a snack?\" If the author is a baby, then they're not at fault because they can't help it. However, if the author is an adult but metaphorically a \"newborn\" to the situation, maybe the question is different. But the edit explicitly states the author is a newborn. So the answer would be B (No), because the baby isn't at fault. The parents need to care for their child's needs. The confusion comes from the initial post not clarifying that the author is a baby in the edit. So the answer hinges on the clarification that the author is a newborn, making it not their fault.\n"
