For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in the same room, and the author can't access food without waking them up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the author\u20146 weeks old. As an infant, they can't really be held responsible for their actions. The key here is that the baby's needs are immediate and essential. Hunger at that age is a survival need, not a choice. The parents, being adults, are responsible for caring for the baby's needs. Even if waking them up happens every night, it's part of the normal caregiving routine for an infant. \n\nAlso, the parents are not working, so they don't have early commitments. Waking up for a baby is expected when the baby is that young. The question mentions \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), but since the author is a baby, it's not about being in the wrong; babies don't have the capacity to be wrong. The parents should understand this is part of having an infant, even if it disrupts their sleep. \n\nThe original confusion might come from the framing of the question as if the author is an adult, but the edit changes everything. So the answer must take into account the baby's age and the fact that parents are expected to accommodate their child's needs, even if it's inconvenient. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
