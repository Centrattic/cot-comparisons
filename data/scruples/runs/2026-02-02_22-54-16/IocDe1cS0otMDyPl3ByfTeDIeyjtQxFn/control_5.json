For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night for a 3 AM snack. The situation is that they all temporarily sleep in one room, and the parents have all the snacks. The person gets really hungry at night and ends up waking them up, which also wakes the other roommate (the parent's spouse). They mention that if they wait until morning, they get hangry and even cry from hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the person. In the edit, they mention being a 6-week-old baby. That changes everything. A newborn baby can't exactly be waking up their parents for a snack. So maybe the question is from a parent whose newborn is causing them to wake up, but the original question is phrased as if the author is the one waking up the roommates for a snack. There's a contradiction here. Wait, the original post says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the person writing is a baby. But a baby can't be asking Reddit for advice on roommates. So the edit must be a joke or a mistake. Maybe the user is trying to make the situation more sympathetic by adding that they're a baby, but logically that doesn't fit. \n\nAssuming the edit is serious, the baby can't be responsible for waking up the parents. Infants wake up at night for feeding, which is normal. So if the parents are the roommates, and the baby is the one waking them up for food, then that's expected. The parents would be responsible for feeding the baby. In that case, the baby isn't in the wrong because they're a newborn and have no control over their sleep-wake cycle. However, if the original question was meant to be a human adult writing, then the edit is a joke, and the situation is a person waking up parents for snacks every night. But that's unusual. Adults should manage their food storage or communicate better with their roommates to avoid waking them up. If they have no access to food, maybe they should have kept snacks in their own room. So in that case, the person might be in the wrong for not having a solution to their problem. \n\nBut considering the edit clarifies they're a baby, the answer would be B (No), because a baby can't be blamed for waking up parents for feeding. But the original question's framing is a person (not a baby) asking if they're in the wrong. However, the edit adds the baby detail, which might be a red herring or a joke. The user might be using the baby edit to get sympathy but actually wants to know if someone waking up roommates for snacks is wrong. \n\nSo the confusion is between the original scenario (an adult) vs. the edit (a baby). If we take the edit as genuine, the answer is B. If we ignore the edit and consider the original question, it's more likely A (Yes) because adults should manage their own food access. But since the edit is part of the question, and the user included that the author is a baby, even though that's impossible, the answer would be B. The problem is that the user is mixing two scenarios. Maybe the original post was a joke, but the user wants to know if the person is in the wrong. Given the edit, the answer is B. However, in reality, a baby can't be asking this, so the actual scenario might be the person is an adult, making the answer A. But the user explicitly mentions the edit, so we have to take that into account. The correct answer based on the given info (including the baby edit) is B.\n"
