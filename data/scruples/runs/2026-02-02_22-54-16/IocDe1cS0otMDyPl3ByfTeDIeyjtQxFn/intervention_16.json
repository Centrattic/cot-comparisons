For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) to get a snack at 3 AM. They mention that they're a newborn, so maybe the situation is different because they're a baby. Wait, the edit says they're a 6-week-old baby. Oh, right, so the author is a baby, and the roommates are the parents.\n\nSo, the baby needs to eat late at night. But the parents have all the snacks, and the baby can't access them. So the baby wakes up hungry and needs to get the parents to give them a snack. The baby says that if they wait until 6 or 7 AM, they'd be really cranky and even cry from hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nNow, the original question is whether the baby is in the wrong. But since the baby is a newborn, they can't really be in the wrong. The situation is that the baby needs to eat, and the parents are responsible for feeding them. The fact that the baby is waking up hungry because the parents have the snacks is a bit odd. Wait, but parents usually have the baby's food available. Maybe the baby is trying to get a snack from the parents, but as a newborn, they don't have solid food yet. So maybe this is about breastfeeding or formula? If the baby is waking up hungry, the parents are supposed to feed them. If the parents are keeping the baby's food (like formula or breastmilk) and the baby can't access it, that's the parents' responsibility. So the baby isn't in the wrong for needing to be fed. The parents might need to adjust how they handle feeding the baby at night. Since the baby is a newborn, it's normal to wake up multiple times for feedings. The parents, being the caregivers, should be the ones to provide the food without the baby needing to \"wake them up\" in the sense of being inconsiderate. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because it's the parents' responsibility to feed the baby when needed.\n"
