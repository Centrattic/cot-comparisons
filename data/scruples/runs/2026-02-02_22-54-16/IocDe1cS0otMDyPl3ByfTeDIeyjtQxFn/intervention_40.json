For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that the author, a newborn, is living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where everyone's sleeping in the same room. The parents aren't working, so their sleep isn't as crucial for morning obligations.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being \"hangry/cranky\" and even crying from hunger if they don't eat. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. Their bodies require frequent feeding, especially in the early weeks. So, the author's need for food at 3 AM is partly biological.\n\nThe parents are the ones with all the snacks, so the author has no choice but to wake them up. Since they're in the same room, waking one parent might also wake the other. The key point here is the temporary living situation and the author's age. As a newborn, their feeding schedule is naturally more frequent and not something they can control. The parents, being adults, can adjust their routines, especially since they're not working and can sleep in later.\n\nConsidering the context, it's more about the necessity driven by the author's age and the temporary setup. The parents might be frustrated, but the author isn't doing this out of habit or disregard\u2014they're following their natural needs. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
