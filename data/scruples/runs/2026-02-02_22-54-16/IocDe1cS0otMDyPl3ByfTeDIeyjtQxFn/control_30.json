For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a newborn living with their parents in a temporary setup where everyone is sleeping in one room. The author gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and has to wake up their parent to get a snack, which also wakes the other parent. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author. Since they mentioned being a 6-week-old newborn, that's a baby. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They need to eat frequently, often every few hours. So, the author isn't just wanting a snack; it's a necessity for their health and well-being. The parents are the ones responsible for caring for the baby, so waking them up is part of parenting. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. But realistically, a baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents are aware of the situation and are supposed to care for the baby's needs. The fact that the baby is waking them up is just part of having a newborn. The parents should be prepared for this as they are the ones taking care of the baby. Also, since they're not working, they have the flexibility to rest when the baby is asleep but can't avoid being woken up during feeding times. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because it's a baby's natural need, and the parents are responsible for meeting those needs even if it means being woken up at night. The situation is temporary and part of parenting.\n"
