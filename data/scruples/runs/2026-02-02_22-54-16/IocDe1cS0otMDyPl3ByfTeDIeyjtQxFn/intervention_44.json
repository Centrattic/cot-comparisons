For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment, but they're all temporarily in one room. The author is a 6-week-old baby, which I need to remember. The baby gets hungry at around 2 or 3 AM and has to wake up the parents to get a snack because they don't have access to food themselves. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the baby is at fault for waking them up every night.\n\nFirst, the baby is only six weeks old. I know that newborns have very different sleep patterns than adults. They need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours, especially if they're on breast milk, which is harder to digest. So from a biological standpoint, the baby's need to eat at 2 or 3 AM is natural and expected. The parents, being the ones caring for the baby, probably already understand that this is a normal part of having a newborn. \n\nThe parents are not working, so they don't need to be up at a specific time, and the baby's feeding schedule might adjust as they grow. Plus, the baby mentions they get very hangry and even cry if they don't eat, which is typical for a newborn. The parents, as caregivers, should anticipate these needs. \n\nHowever, the situation is that the parents have all the snacks, and the baby needs them to get up. But since the baby is a newborn, it's likely that the parents are the ones who are supposed to tend to the baby's needs, including feeding them. It's a bit of a catch-22 because the baby can't access the food by themselves. But since the baby is so young, they can't be expected to know how to get food on their own. The parents, on the other hand, are responsible for the baby's care, so waking them up is part of their role. \n\nThe AITA aspect here might be a bit of a trick question because the baby is a newborn. The question is phrased as if the author is an adult, but the edit clarifies that they're a baby. So in reality, the baby isn't making a conscious choice to wake up the parents; it's just a natural need. The parents, as adults, are the ones who should be managing the baby's care, so the baby isn't at fault. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the baby isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a result of biological needs and the parents' responsibility to care for them. The parents might find it inconvenient, but it's part of having a newborn. The situation is temporary and necessary for the baby's well-being. So the author, being a baby, isn't at fault for needing to eat and waking up the parents."
