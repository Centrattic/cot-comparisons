For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents. They need a snack around 3 AM but can't access food without waking the parents up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author is a newborn, which is a baby. The parents are the roommates. The baby is waking them up for a snack at 2-3 AM. The parents aren't working, so they don't have to be up early. The baby gets hungry and cranky if they wait.\n\nWait, but a newborn can't eat regular snacks. Newborns don't eat solid food. They feed on milk, either breastmilk or formula. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If the baby is genuinely a newborn, they can't be eating snacks. Instead, they'd be feeding every few hours. But the parents are the ones waking up anyway to feed the baby. So the question might be phrased incorrectly. The author is a baby, so maybe the parents are the ones waking up to feed the baby, not the other way around. The parents might be the ones getting up, not the baby waking them up. \n\nBut according to the edit, the author is a 6-week-old newborn. So the scenario is likely about the baby needing to eat, which naturally wakes the parents up. The parents might be the ones getting up, but the question is phrased as the author (baby) waking them up. However, babies can't intentionally wake up adults. So maybe there's a mistake in the original question. The real issue is that the baby is hungry and needs to be fed, which is a natural part of parenting. The parents are the ones who have to adjust their sleep for the baby's needs. \n\nIn that case, the baby isn't in the wrong, as they can't control their feeding schedule. The parents are expected to care for the baby's needs, even if it means less sleep for them. The answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem here is the phrasing of the question, but the essence is that a newborn's needs are beyond their control, and parents are supposed to accommodate that. So the answer should be B.\n"
