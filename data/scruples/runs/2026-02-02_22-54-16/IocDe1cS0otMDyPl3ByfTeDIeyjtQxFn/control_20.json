For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates, who are their parents, for a midnight snack. The baby wakes up hungry around 2-3 AM, and the parents have all the snacks. The baby has to wake them up every night, which also wakes the other parent.\n\nFirst, considering that the author is a newborn, which is a baby, maybe just 6 weeks old. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby. But how can a 6-week-old be asking about this? Maybe it's a typo or a joke? Maybe the person is using a baby's perspective metaphorically, but in reality, a baby can't eat snacks at 3 AM. Wait, but the scenario mentions being \"hungry\" and needing a snack. Maybe it's a humorous take, but let's take it at face value as per the given text.\n\nSo if the author is a baby, then the situation is different. A baby can't eat snacks. Babies need to eat every few hours, usually breastmilk or formula. So if the baby is waking up hungry, the parents are supposed to feed them. But in the scenario, the baby is asking for a snack, which is unusual for a baby. Also, the parents are not working, so they can sleep in. But the baby's hunger is causing them to be cranky if not fed. \n\nBut if the author is actually a baby, then the parents should be feeding them, not giving snacks. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the baby is being weaned onto solid foods, but even then, waking up for snacks every night isn't typical. Parents usually adjust their sleep schedules for a newborn. However, if the parents are not working, they might be able to stay up with the baby. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is a baby, they can't be blamed for needing to eat. However, the scenario is presented as a human adult asking, using a baby's perspective, which is likely a humorous twist. So in reality, the person is an adult, using a baby's voice to make a point. In that case, the actual situation is that an adult is waking up their parents every night for a snack, which is unreasonable. \n\nIf we take the original scenario as presented, with the author as a baby, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because a baby can't help being hungry and needs to eat. However, if it's a human adult, then they're in the wrong. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old, so the answer is B. The parents should adjust to the baby's needs, even if it means waking up. So the answer is B.\n"
