For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. They mention that they're a 6-week-old baby, so maybe there's some confusion here. Wait, the edit says they are a newborn/baby. So the actual situation is that a baby is waking up at night for a snack, which in reality would be feeding the baby, not the parents. But the original post is written from the baby's perspective, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the edit.\n\nAssuming the original poster is a baby, then the situation is that the baby needs to be fed at night, which naturally wakes up the parents. Since the parents are the ones taking care of the baby, it's expected that they might be woken up for feedings. However, the original post mentions that the roommates are a married couple (the parents) and the baby is in the same room. So the baby needs to eat at night, but the parents have the snacks (maybe formula, breast milk, etc.), and the baby can't get it without waking them up.\n\nBut since the baby is only 6 weeks old, it's normal for them to need frequent feedings. However, the baby can't just \"wake up the parents for a snack\" in the way an adult would. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby, so it's their responsibility to be woken up. The question is if the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby is a newborn, they can't be in the wrong. The real issue here might be the parents' perspective. But the question is phrased as AITA (Am I the Asshole) from the baby's point of view, which is a bit of a joke because a baby isn't making a choice here.\n\nIf the original scenario was that the person is an adult baby (or using baby as a metaphor), then maybe the analysis is different. But given the context, it's likely a real baby. The parents are the ones caring for the baby, so waking them up for feedings is necessary. The parents might be dealing with lack of sleep, but it's part of having a newborn. The baby can't be blamed for needing to eat. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
