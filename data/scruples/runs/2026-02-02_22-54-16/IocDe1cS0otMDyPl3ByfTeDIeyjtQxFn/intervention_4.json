For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room, and the author is a newborn. They can't get food without waking up their parents, who are the roommates. The author says they get very hungry and cranky if they don't eat, leading to crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. The edit says they're a 6-week-old baby. That's a key detail. Babies can't really help themselves; they rely entirely on caregivers for their needs, including feeding. So, if a baby is hungry at 3 AM, they need to be fed. The parents are their caregivers, so waking them up for a feeding is part of the normal care routine. \n\nBut wait, the original post was framed as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question, which usually involves adults. The fact that the author is a baby changes the context completely. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so the baby isn't at fault here. The parents might be dealing with sleep deprivation, but that's part of having a newborn. \n\nThe parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby's needs take priority. The baby can't help being hungry, so waking them up isn't the baby's fault. Also, the baby can't access the snacks independently. The parents should have set up a system where they can feed the baby without being disturbed, but realistically, with a newborn, it's expected that feeding times will wake everyone up. \n\nIn this scenario, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The baby has a legitimate need that requires attention, and the parents are the ones responsible for meeting that need. The parents might need to adjust their own schedules or find ways to make feeding times less disruptive, but the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat.\n"
