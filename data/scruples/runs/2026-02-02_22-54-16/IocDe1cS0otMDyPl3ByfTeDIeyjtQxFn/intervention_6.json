For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The setup is that they all live in one room temporarily, and the roommates (who are their parents) have the snacks. The person is a newborn, so maybe that's key here.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the author is a baby. Babies have basic needs like eating, and they can't really help it if they need food in the middle of the night. The parents aren't working, so their schedules are flexible. Waking them up for a snack might be necessary because the baby can't store food or access it on their own.\n\nThe parents are the ones with the snacks, so maybe they should have baby-friendly options available without needing to be woken. But since the baby can't help it, the responsibility isn't on them. Also, the parents aren't working, so their sleep might not be as important as the baby's need to eat. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the baby isn't at fault because they can't control their hunger. The parents might need to adjust by keeping snacks more accessible for the baby. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
