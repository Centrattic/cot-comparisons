For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for waking up their parents every night for a 3 AM snack. The roommate situation is actually their parents, and they're in Massachusetts.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is a newborn, but wait, the edit says \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the original post says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" Oh, the author is a baby. So they're an infant. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in. The baby needs a snack at 3 AM but can't access it without waking the parents. The parents are the roommates here, so it's a family situation. \n\nIn most cases, parents of infants know that babies have frequent feeding needs. Newborns need to eat every few hours. If the baby is waking up hungry, it's a natural part of their development. But the question here is framed as if the baby is asking if they're wrong for waking the parents. However, since the baby is six weeks old, it's unlikely they can choose to wake up; they're just following their biological needs. \n\nBut the scenario is presented as an AITA situation, which is typically from an adult's perspective. The original question might be a humorous or hypothetical take. The parents might be the ones dealing with the baby's schedule, but the baby isn't at fault because they can't control their feeding needs. Newborns need to eat frequently, so waking up for feeds is normal. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the baby isn't in control here. The parents should adjust their schedule to accommodate their infant's needs. Since the parents aren't working, they have the flexibility to be up with the baby. So the answer would be B, the author (baby) isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the initial question is phrased as if the author is an adult asking if they're wrong. However, the edit clarifies that the author is a baby. That's a bit of a twist. The answer hinges on the age and the fact that the parents are the ones who have chosen to have a baby. So the baby isn't in the wrong; the parents are expected to handle the baby's needs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
