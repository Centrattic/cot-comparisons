For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that all three are temporarily sharing one bedroom because of circumstances. The author, who is a 6-week-old baby, needs a midnight snack and has to wake up a parent (since the parents are the ones with access to the snacks). The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentioned that the author is a newborn. That's a big detail. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. So, the act of waking up for a feeding isn't really the baby's choice. The baby can't help it\u2014it's a biological necessity.\n\nBut wait, the original post says the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby,\" but in the AITA scenario, the person is referring to eating a late-night snack. Wait, that might be confusing. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are the parents. So the original question is phrased as if the author is an adult, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. That's a key point. So the person asking is not an adult but an infant. \n\nIn that case, the baby isn't making a conscious choice to wake up. The parents are the ones who are taking care of the baby. So the question is a bit of a trick because the framing is as if it's an adult making the choice, but it's actually a baby. So the real issue here is whether the parents are in the wrong for the baby's needs. But the parents are the ones being woken up, and they are the ones responsible for feeding the baby. It's part of parenting. \n\nBut the original post is written from the baby's perspective, which is unusual. So maybe the humor here is that the baby is being framed as the \"ITA\" (in the wrong) person, but realistically, the baby can't help needing to eat. Parents are expected to take care of their baby's needs, even if it means waking up. So the answer would be that the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The parents are the ones who have to care for the baby. \n\nBut the problem is that the question is phrased as if the author is an adult, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not). Since the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat, the answer is B. The confusion comes from the framing, but once you know the author is a baby, it's clear.\n"
