For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original scenario mentions that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author, who's a newborn, needs to eat around that time. The roommates are the parents, who aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nHmm, the key points here are that the author is a newborn. As a baby, they can't access food themselves, and they need to eat regularly, especially at night. Since the parents have the snacks (probably baby food or formula?), the author has to wake them up to get fed. The parents aren't working, so their sleep isn't as crucial as maybe someone with a job. Also, the parents are the ones who have the food, so the author doesn't have another option. \n\nBut wait, the original post mentions \"snacks,\" which might be a bit funny in the context of a newborn. Newborns don't eat snacks; they need to feed frequently. So maybe the parent is using \"snack\" metaphorically, like needing to feed the baby. The edit clarifies that the author is a baby, so the parents are being woken up to feed the baby. In that case, it's not the author's fault because it's a baby's natural need. The parents chose to have a child, so they should expect to be woken up for feedings. Therefore, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
