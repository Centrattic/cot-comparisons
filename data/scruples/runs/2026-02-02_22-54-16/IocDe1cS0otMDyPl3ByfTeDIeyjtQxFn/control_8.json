For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves waking up roommates for a midnight snack. The edit mentions that the writer is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents. \n\nFirst, the context is crucial here. The person is a newborn, so their needs are basic and essential. Newborns have frequent feeding requirements, whether it's breast milk or formula. Since they can't express their needs on their own, they rely entirely on caregivers.\n\nThe parents are the roommates here, and they're not working, so they're likely at home. The parents have the responsibility of caring for the baby. Even if it's in the middle of the night, the baby's feeding is necessary. The parents, being the caregivers, would be expected to attend to the baby's needs. \n\nThe original question might have been confusing because of the initial setup without the edit. But once you know it's a baby, the situation changes. The parents are not wrong for responding to their newborn's needs. The baby isn't at fault here because they can't help that they're hungry. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the baby's needs are essential and the parents are responsible for meeting them regardless of the time. The parents aren't working, so they have the flexibility to accommodate these nighttime feedings.\n"
