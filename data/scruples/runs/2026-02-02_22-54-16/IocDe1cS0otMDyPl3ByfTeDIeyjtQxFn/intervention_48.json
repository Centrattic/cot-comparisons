For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a newborn baby waking up the parents for a 3 AM snack. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in, but the baby needs to eat to avoid being hangry and crying.\n\nFirst, the baby's needs are pretty basic survival. Infants can't go long without eating, especially around that age. So waking up for a snack is necessary. The parents are in the same room, so when the baby wakes up, they get woken up too. Since the parents aren't working, their schedules are flexible. The baby can't access the snacks independently, so relying on the parents to get food makes sense. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the baby isn't at fault here. They can't help being hungry at night. The situation is temporary, as the baby is only 6 weeks old. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, which includes feeding them. The baby's actions aren't malicious; it's just a natural need. The parents probably understand this, but the question is if the baby is in the wrong. \n\nSince the baby is a newborn and can't help their situation, the answer should be B, meaning they're not in the wrong. The humor in the question is obvious, but the actual scenario is about an infant's needs versus the parents' temporary inconvenience. The parents are the caregivers, so it's their responsibility, not the baby's fault.\n"
