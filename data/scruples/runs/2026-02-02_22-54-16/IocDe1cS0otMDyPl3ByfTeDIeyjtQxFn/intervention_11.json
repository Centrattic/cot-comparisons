For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The key points here are the context and the relationships involved.\n\nFirst, the author is a newborn, which is crucial. The roommates are the author's parents. The situation is temporary, and they're all sleeping in one room. The author needs a snack at night because they're a baby and would get very hungry, leading to being hangry or crying. The parents aren't working, so their mornings aren't affected. The main issue is whether waking them up for a snack is unreasonable.\n\nConsidering the age of the author, a newborn, their needs are legitimate and not something they can control. Parents are typically expected to accommodate their child's needs, even if it involves some inconvenience. Since the parents are not working and can sleep in, waking them up at 3 AM might be a small disturbance compared to the potential distress of the baby. Also, the temporary nature of the living situation suggests that this isn't a long-term arrangement, so it's a temporary adjustment period.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the parents could prepare in advance, like keeping snacks accessible or adjusting their sleeping arrangements. But given that the author is a baby, the parents are likely aware of their child's needs and might have already considered such solutions. The fact that the parents are not working also means they have more flexibility in their schedule. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the reasonableness of the situation. Here, the baby's need for food is a basic, essential need, and the parents are expected to care for their child. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
