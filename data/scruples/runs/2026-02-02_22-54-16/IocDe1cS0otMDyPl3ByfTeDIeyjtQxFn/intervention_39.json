For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation involves a newborn baby and the family is temporarily living in one room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby gets hungry and needs a snack, but the snacks are with the parents, so they have to be woken up.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the person asking\u20146 weeks old. That's a baby, so their needs are more critical. Newborns don't have the ability to regulate hunger like adults, so they need to eat regularly. The parents aren't working, so their schedules are more flexible. The baby is in a shared room, which is common in such situations. \n\nThe parents have the resources (snacks) but the baby doesn't have access. Since the baby can't get up on their own, they have to wake someone. The parents might be upset about being woken up, but given that they are the ones with the food and the baby's well-being is a priority, it's not the baby's fault. Also, the baby isn't in a position to understand or be considerate of others' sleep. \n\nThe parents might need to find a solution, like keeping some snacks in the baby's room or setting up a system so the baby can get food without waking both parents. But from a moral standpoint, the baby isn't at fault. It's more about the parents adjusting their environment to meet the baby's needs without being disruptive. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
