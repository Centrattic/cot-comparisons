For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The setup is that they're all sleeping in one room temporarily, and the author can't access food without waking up the roommates. The author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents who aren't working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, so they can't help their hunger. They can't wait until morning because they'd get too hungry and upset. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can adjust their sleep. But as a baby, their needs are immediate and beyond their control. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the author and the temporary living situation. Since the author is a newborn, it's not their choice to be awake at 3 AM. They can't help needing to eat. The parents are adults, so they might be expected to handle the situation, maybe by adjusting where the baby is sleeping or preparing food in advance. However, the parents are the roommates, which complicates things. In a typical roommate scenario, waking someone up for snacks would be considered inconsiderate, but when it's a baby with no other option, it's different. \n\nThe author isn't making a choice here; it's a biological need. The parents might need to find a solution, like having baby food ready in the other room or establishing a routine. But the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the baby can't control their hunger or their need to eat, they're not in the wrong. The problem lies in the setup of their temporary living situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
