For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates every night for a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in one room, and the author, who's a newborn, needs a snack around 2-3 AM. The roommates (the parents) have all the snacks, so the author has to wake them up, which also wakes the other parent. The author can't wait until morning because they get very hungry and emotional. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby. Oh, that's a huge detail. So it's not an adult person asking, but an infant. The original question might have been a bit confusing without the edit. The parents are the roommates, and the baby needs to be fed. So the baby wakes the parents up for a late-night snack, but since they're in the same room, the husband is also woken up.\n\nIn real-life terms, when a newborn is involved, waking up parents for feedings is a normal part of having a baby. Newborns need to eat frequently, often every 2-3 hours. It's part of the parenting responsibilities. The parents understand that their baby needs to eat, even if it disrupts their sleep. So the baby isn't in the wrong here because they can't help needing to eat. The situation is temporary, as newborns grow and their feeding schedules adjust over time.\n\nThe original question might have been phrased as if the author is a roommate, but with the edit clarifying it's a baby, the context changes completely. The parents are not roommates in the traditional sense; they're the baby's parents. So the answer would be B, No, the author (baby) is not in the wrong. The parents are expected to handle their baby's needs, even if it means waking up multiple times. The confusion might have come from the initial setup, but the edit resolves it by specifying the author's age and relationship to the roommates.\n"
