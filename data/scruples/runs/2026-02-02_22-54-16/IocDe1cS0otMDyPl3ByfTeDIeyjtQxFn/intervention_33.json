For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 6-week-old baby living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where everyone is sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2-3 AM and needs a snack, which their parent has, so they wake up the parent (and the other parent) to get fed. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their needs are basic and instinctual. Newborns can't go long without eating, and their parents are responsible for feeding them. The parents, being adults, should anticipate this and manage accordingly. The baby isn't doing this out of selfishness but out of biological necessity. \n\nThe question is whether waking up the parents every night is wrong. Since the parents are in the same room, maybe the setup is causing this. But considering it's a temporary arrangement and the parents are aware of the baby's needs, maybe they should adjust their own sleep patterns or find a way to make feeding easier. Also, in Massachusetts, there's no legal aspect here since the parents are the caregivers. \n\nThe parents might feel disturbed, but as the ones caring for a newborn, they should understand the necessity. The baby isn't at fault for needing to eat. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
