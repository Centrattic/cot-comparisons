For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for waking their roommates up every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in the same room because of some circumstances. The author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents aren't working, so maybe they have more flexible sleep schedules. But a newborn baby needing to eat at night is typical. However, the parents might also need their sleep. The problem is that the baby is waking them up every night for a snack. Wait, but a newborn doesn't eat solid snacks\u2014maybe it's a formula or feeding? The edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby, so this is actually about feeding, not snacks. The parents have all the food, so the baby needs to wake them up to get fed.\n\nBut the user is using \"snack\" metaphorically here. Since the author is a baby, this isn't a typical roommate situation. The parents are the caregivers, and it's their responsibility to feed the baby. However, the parents might be trying to sleep in, but with a newborn, frequent feedings are necessary. The baby can't help being hungry at night. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents are expected to care for their child's needs, even if it disrupts their sleep. But the parents might be feeling tired or want to rest. However, given that the baby is a newborn, it's a temporary phase. So the answer would be that the author (the baby) isn't at fault because it's a natural need, and parents are supposed to handle that. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
