For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation involves the user and their parents, who are working from home, all temporarily sleeping in one room. The user, who's a newborn, needs snacks around 2-3 AM but can't access them without waking the parents. The parents aren't working, so they sleep in until 6-7 AM.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the user is a baby, which is a crucial detail. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in. The baby needs to eat, which is a basic necessity. Waking the parents is necessary because the baby can't access the snacks alone. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, when a baby is involved, the situation is different from an adult making a choice to eat late. The baby's needs come first. Parents are used to being woken up for feeding, especially if it's a newborn. The parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. The baby can't help it that they need food at that time. \n\nThe roommates (parents) might be annoyed, but it's a temporary situation. The baby isn't at fault here. The answer should be B, not at fault. The parents should understand that their baby's needs are essential. The main issue isn't the baby waking them up, but maybe the setup of storing snacks. Maybe the parents can adjust by keeping some snacks accessible for the baby to prevent this. But given the circumstances, the baby isn't in the wrong.\n"
