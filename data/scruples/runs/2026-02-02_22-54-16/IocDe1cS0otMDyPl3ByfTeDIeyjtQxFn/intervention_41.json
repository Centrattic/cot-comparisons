For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is a bit specific, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the person lives with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment, but they're all temporarily in one room. The parents aren't working, so they don't have early morning commitments. The person is a 6-week-old baby, which is crucial here. They eat a late-night snack at 10 PM but then wake up very hungry at 2 or 3 AM. The snacks are kept by one of the parents, so the baby has to wake them up. Since they're all in the same room, both parents get woken up. The baby is afraid of being hangry and crying all night if they don't eat.\n\nNow, considering the edit that the author is a newborn, this changes the context. A newborn has no control over their eating schedule and definitely needs to eat frequently. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, so waking up for feedings is part of parenting. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in, but the baby's needs come first. In this case, the baby isn't in the wrong because it's a natural part of their life stage. The parents understand this and should be accommodating.\n\nBut wait, the original question was framed as the author waking roommates up. However, the edit clarifies they are a baby. So the answer hinges on the edit. If the person is an adult, it's different. But since they're a baby, it's a non-issue. The parents would expect this. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're a newborn with no control over their feeding times.\n"
