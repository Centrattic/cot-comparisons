For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The original question mentions they're in a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates, a married couple. All three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The person usually eats a late-night snack around 10 PM but gets really hungry again at 2 or 3 AM. They have to wake one of the roommates (a female roommate) because she has all the snacks, and the layout doesn't allow easy access. This ends up waking the other roommate (the guy) too. The person says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat, and since the roommates aren't working, they can sleep in. \n\nBut then there's an edit: the person is a 6-week-old newborn, and the married couple are their parents. So, the original question was from a baby's perspective. That's a key detail. The user is a newborn, which changes everything. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the author is a baby, their ability to act with intention or be considerate of others' sleep is non-existent. Newborns don't have the cognitive ability to understand that waking others up might be undesirable. They also have biological needs that require frequent feeding. \n\nIn the context of roommates, adults are typically expected to consider others' sleep schedules. However, in this case, the situation is different because the author is an infant. Parents of a newborn are aware that babies need to eat frequently, often every few hours. So, the baby's need to eat at 2 or 3 AM is normal and expected. The parents might not be roommates in the traditional sense but as a family, especially since the baby is part of their household. \n\nThe question mentions the state is Massachusetts, which might relate to legal aspects, but since the baby is the one eating, it's more about social expectations. The original answer would be B (No), because the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat. However, the edit clarifies that the roommates are the baby's parents. So, the question is whether a baby is in the wrong for waking their parents up to get a snack. The answer is no, because it's a natural part of the baby's development and needs. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby, so the baby isn't being inconsiderate but is simply acting on necessity. \n\nSo, the correct answer is B.\n"
