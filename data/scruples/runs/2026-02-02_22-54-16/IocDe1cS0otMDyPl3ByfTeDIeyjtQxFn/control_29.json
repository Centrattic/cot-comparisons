For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that they're all living in one room temporarily, and the author, who is a newborn, needs a snack at 3 AM. The roommates (the parents) have all the snacks, so the author has to wake them up. The author says they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author. The edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That's a baby. So, the original question was presented as an adult asking if they're in the wrong, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. That's a huge detail that changes everything. \n\nWhen the question was first posted, without the edit, it's a typical AITA scenario where someone is waking up their roommates. But with the edit, it's actually a baby needing a snack. Babies can't take care of themselves, so parents have a responsibility to feed them. The parents aren't working, so they don't have other commitments. The baby's hunger is a necessity, not a choice. \n\nThe original question was phrased as if the author is an adult roommates, but the edit changes that. The answer depends on the edit. Since the author is a newborn, it's not their fault. Parents are supposed to take care of their baby's needs, even at 3 AM. The parents might be frustrated, but the baby isn't at fault. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. The confusion comes from the initial question not having the edit, but once you know it's a baby, the answer is clear.\n"
