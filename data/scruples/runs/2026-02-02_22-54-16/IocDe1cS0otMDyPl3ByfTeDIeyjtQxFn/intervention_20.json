For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night for a snack. The situation is that the author is a 6-week-old newborn, and the parents aren't working, so they're sleeping in the same room. The author needs to eat around 2 or 3 AM, but doesn't have easy access to food, so they have to wake the parents up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, so their needs are different from an adult. Infants can't go long without eating because they need to eat frequently to grow and maintain energy. The parents are not working, so their schedules are more flexible. However, the author is waking both parents up, which might be disruptive.\n\nBut wait, the parents are the author's caregivers. In a typical parent-infant scenario, it's expected that the parents will care for the baby's needs, including feeding them at night. The question is whether this situation is analogous to typical parent-infant dynamics or if the author's situation is different because they're living in an apartment with roommates (even though they're parents). \n\nThe edit clarifies that the roommates are actually the parents, so it's a parent-child situation. In that case, waking up the parents for feeding is normal and necessary. The parents are responsible for the child's well-being. The parents not working might mean they can adjust their sleep schedule to accommodate the baby's needs.\n\nHowever, if the parents are not the caregivers but just roommates, but the edit clarifies that they are the parents, so the dynamic is different. As a baby, the author can't help but need to eat. The parents are expected to take care of their child's needs, even if it means waking up. The parents might have their own needs, but as parents, their child's needs take priority.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The parents are responsible for the child's care, and waking them up for feeding is part of that responsibility. The parents' lack of work in the mornings might make it easier for them to adjust their sleep. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
