For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that they're all in one room temporarily, and the author is a 6-week-old baby. The roommates are their parents, and the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the baby and the living situation. A 6-week-old baby has different needs compared to an adult. Infants often need to eat frequently, especially at night. The parents are not working, so their sleep schedule is flexible. The baby might be hungry and uncomfortable, leading to crying if not fed. Waking the parents is part of the natural expectations when a new baby is in the household. \n\nThe parents are also in the same room, so waking them up is unavoidable. The baby isn't doing this out of selfishness but out of necessity for survival and comfort. Since they're the baby's parents, they should expect that their sleep will be interrupted during this phase. \n\nThe initial question might have seemed like a roommate situation, but with the edit clarifying family dynamics and the baby's age, it's clear that the author isn't at fault. The answer is B.\n"
