For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a baby waking up parents for a snack at 3 AM. Wait, the original post mentions the user is a 6-week-old newborn, and the roommates are their parents. So, the baby needs to eat at night. But the way the question is phrased initially makes it sound like an adult. But the edit clarifies that the author is a baby. \n\nSo, the key here is that the baby isn't actually a person making a choice; they're an infant. Parents are there to take care of the baby's needs, including feeding them during the night. In that case, the baby is not in the wrong because it's a natural part of their development. The parents are expected to care for them. Also, the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, and the baby's hunger is a basic need.\n\nBut I need to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original question was presented as if the author is a person living with roommates, but the edit changes it to a baby. The key point is the baby's age. Since infants can't help needing to eat multiple times a night, especially at 6 weeks old, it's completely normal. The parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The confusion might come from the initial framing, but the edit clarifies the baby's age, making the situation about parental responsibility."
