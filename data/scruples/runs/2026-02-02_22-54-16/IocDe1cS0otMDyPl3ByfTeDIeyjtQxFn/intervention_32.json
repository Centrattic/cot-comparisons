For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) at 3 AM for a snack. The key points here are the context provided in the edit: the author is a 6-week-old baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is responsible for their actions. Since they're a newborn, they can't be held accountable in the same way an adult would be. The question mentions \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), but that usually applies to adults. A baby doesn't have the ability to control their hunger or schedule their meals. They need to eat when they're hungry, regardless of the time. \n\nNext, the roommates are the parents, who are presumably used to dealing with a newborn's schedule. Parents typically adjust their routines when they have a baby, including feeding the baby in the middle of the night. The parents aren't working, so they have more flexibility. The situation is temporary, as the family is staying in one room, which might be a common scenario when a new baby arrives.\n\nThe original dilemma mentions being \"hangry/cranky\" if the snack isn't eaten, but as a baby, the author can't communicate that in a mature way. Parents understand that babies have these needs and adjust accordingly. The fact that the parents are married and not working means they can prioritize the baby's needs over their own sleep. \n\nThe core issue here is whether the action (waking up the parents) is the baby's fault. Since the baby isn't making a conscious choice, it's not their fault. The parents are in a position where they've likely anticipated these needs when having a baby. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
