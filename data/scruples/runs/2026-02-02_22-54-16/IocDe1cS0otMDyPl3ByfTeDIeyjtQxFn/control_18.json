For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that the writer is a newborn, so they can't eat independently and need the snacks from their parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, so they don't have the capacity to understand boundaries or social norms. But since it's an AITA question, the user might be asking from a hypothetical perspective, maybe trying to see if their actions as a parent (if they were the parent) would be justified. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn, and the married couple are the parents. So the question is from the baby's perspective, which is a bit unusual. But since the baby can't be held responsible for their actions, the real question might be whether the parents are in the wrong for allowing this. However, the user is asking if the author (baby) is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, waking up someone for a snack might be considered inconsiderate if it's done without cause. But in this case, the baby is a newborn with essential needs. Newborns feed frequently, and it's normal for parents to be awakened for feedings. However, the question mentions snacks, which might imply solid foods, but a 6-week-old would typically be on breastmilk or formula, not snacks. That might be a red flag. Maybe the baby is being referred to metaphorically, or there's a translation issue. Alternatively, perhaps the baby needs some kind of feeding, and the parents are providing it. \n\nAssuming the baby is actually a newborn needing to eat, then it's expected for parents to accommodate feedings regardless of the time. Parents of newborns understand that their baby's needs come first. However, if the baby is eating snacks, which is unusual, maybe the situation is different. If it's a human baby, solid foods aren't usually introduced until around 6 months. But the user might be using \"snack\" metaphorically for feeding. \n\nGiven that the parents are not working, they have the flexibility to sleep in, but the baby's needs must be met. It's a temporary situation, as the baby will grow and require less frequent feedings. Therefore, the author (the baby) isn't in the wrong because they can't help their biological needs. The parents are expected to care for the baby's needs, even if it means being woken up. \n\nBut the question is framed as whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a newborn, they can't be at fault. The parents might be considering their own well-being, but the baby has no choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
