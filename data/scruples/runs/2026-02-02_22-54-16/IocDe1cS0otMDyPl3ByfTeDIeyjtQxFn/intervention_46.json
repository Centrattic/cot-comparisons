For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is an infant, right? They're asking if they're at fault for waking up their parents for a snack at 3 AM. So, first, the situation is that they're a newborn, living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where everyone sleeps in one room. The parents are not working, so they have flexible mornings. The baby is hungry at night and needs a snack, so they wake the parents up. The parents are okay with this because they don't have to work early.\n\nHmm. Well, as a baby, they can't help it that they need to eat. Infants typically need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours. It's part of their development. The parents, being their caregivers, are responsible for meeting their needs, including feeding them during the night. Since the parents are not working and can sleep in, the baby waking them up isn't really inconsiderate. The baby can't control their hunger or the timing of their meals. So from an ethical standpoint, the baby isn't at fault. The parents are aware of the situation and have the means to accommodate it. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
