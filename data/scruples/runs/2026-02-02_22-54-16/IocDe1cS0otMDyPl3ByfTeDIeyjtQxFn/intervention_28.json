For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates, who are their parents, every night at 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, which is a key detail.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a baby, so their needs are different from an adult. They can't sleep through the night and need to eat, which is a basic biological requirement. The roommates are the parents, who aren't working, so they have time to care for the baby. The parents have all the snacks, and the baby can't access them without waking them up. The baby gets hangry if they don't eat, which makes sense for an infant.\n\nNow, considering typical parent-infant dynamics, it's normal for a newborn to need frequent feeding. Parents are expected to care for their child's needs, even at odd hours. The author isn't making a choice here; it's a necessity. The parents, being the ones responsible for the baby, should adjust their sleep for the child's well-being. Since they're not working, the impact on their rest might be significant, but it's a temporary situation. Also, the author mentioned it's a temporary living arrangement, which might mean this won't last forever. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is a baby, it's not about right or wrong in a moral sense. The parents are aware of the situation and should prepare for it. The baby can't help their needs, so it's not their fault. The parents might be the ones needing to adjust, not the baby. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The baby's needs take priority here, and the parents are responsible for meeting those needs as part of caregiving.\n"
