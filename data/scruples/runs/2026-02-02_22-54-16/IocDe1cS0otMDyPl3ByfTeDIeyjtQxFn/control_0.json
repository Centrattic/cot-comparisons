For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a 3 AM snack. The context is that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the parents aren't working. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the baby's age and the parents' current situation. A newborn would naturally have frequent feeding needs, especially in the middle of the night. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in later. The baby is waking them up for snacks, which in this case is likely formula, breast milk, or baby food, depending on the actual situation. \n\nThe parents are the ones who brought the baby into the room temporarily, so they might have anticipated some middle-of-the-night needs. The baby can't help being hungry and needing to eat regularly. Since the parents are not working, they might have the flexibility to accommodate the baby's schedule. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the baby is in the wrong. But the baby is only 6 weeks old; they don't have the capacity to be in the wrong. The parents are responsible for the baby's care. The real issue here is whether the parents should be expected to handle the baby's frequent feedings without complaint. \n\nIn the original scenario, the user wrote as an adult, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. So the answer hinges on the baby's age. Since a newborn can't be at fault for needing to eat, the answer would be B (No). The parents are the caregivers and must manage their rest accordingly. The baby's needs are essential and not a moral failing.\n"
