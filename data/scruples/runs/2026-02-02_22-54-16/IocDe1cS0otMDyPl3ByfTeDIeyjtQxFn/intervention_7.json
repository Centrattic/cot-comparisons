For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The setup is that they're all in one room temporarily, the author needs snacks at 2-3 AM but doesn't have access, so they have to wake up one roommate (who has the snacks), and probably the other one too. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The edit says the author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nFirst, the age factor is huge. A newborn can't really be responsible for their actions, so the situation is likely about the parents dealing with their baby's needs. But the original post was written from the author's perspective, which might be a bit confusing because a newborn can't write. Maybe it's a typo or a humorous edit. Assuming it's a typo and the author is a person, but then the edit says they're a baby. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the edit is a joke or a mistake. Let me read the edit again: \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents.\" So the original author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. So the question is, is the baby in the wrong for waking up the parents for a snack?\n\nWell, a baby can't be at fault here. They can't control their hunger or their sleep schedule. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby's needs. Even if the parents are sleeping, waking up for a baby's needs is part of parenting. Plus, the parents aren't working, so they have more flexibility. The baby isn't being inconsiderate; it's just their nature. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. But there's some confusion because the initial scenario is written from an adult's perspective, but the edit changes that. Maybe the user is testing if the assistant can catch the edit and adjust accordingly. So, considering all that, the answer is B.\n"
