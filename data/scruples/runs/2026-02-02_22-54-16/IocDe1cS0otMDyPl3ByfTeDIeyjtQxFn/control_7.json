For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe setup is that the author is living with two roommates, a married couple, in a two-bedroom apartment. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author eats a late-night snack at 10 PM but wakes up very hungry around 2 or 3 AM. The problem is that one of the roommates (the mother) has all the snacks, and the author can't access them without waking her up. This ends up waking both roommates because they're in the same room. The author says they can't wait until morning because they get hangry and even cry from hunger. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author's action reasonable under the circumstances? The author is a newborn, as per the edit. Wait, the original post says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the author is an infant. That's a huge detail. Infants have different needs. They need to eat frequently, and their schedules aren't the same as adults. So waking up parents for feedings is normal and expected. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but they would still need to care for a newborn. \n\nThe parents have the snacks (probably food for the baby?), but maybe the baby is on formula or breast milk. Either way, the parents are responsible for feeding the baby. If the baby is hungry, the parents should respond. However, the parents might be struggling with sleep deprivation, which is common with newborns. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is a baby, they can't be blamed for needing to eat. The real issue might be how the parents handle the situation, but the question is about the author's responsibility. \n\nThe original question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) but the edit clarifies that the author is a newborn. In that case, the answer would be B, No, because a baby can't be at fault for needing to eat. The parents are expected to care for the baby's needs, even if it means waking up multiple times. The situation is typical for having a newborn, and the parents are not working, so they can adjust their schedule accordingly. The initial confusion might have been if the author was an adult, but since it's a baby, the answer is clear.\n"
