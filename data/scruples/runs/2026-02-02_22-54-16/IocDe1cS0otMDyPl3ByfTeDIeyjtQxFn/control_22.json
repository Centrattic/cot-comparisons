For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room because of some reasons, and the parents have all the snacks, so the author needs to wake them up to get food. The author mentions that if they don't eat, they get really hungry, hangry, and even cry. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a baby, so maybe they can't help it. But the question is phrased as if the author is an adult, but the edit says they are a newborn. Wait, that's a key point. The original post seems to be from an adult perspective, but the edit clarifies it's a 6-week-old baby. That changes everything. Newborns need to eat frequently, sometimes every few hours, especially if they're breastfeeding or formula-fed. So waking up parents at night for feedings is normal and necessary for the baby's health and development.\n\nIn that case, the parents are the ones who chose to have a baby, and part of parenting involves adjusting sleep schedules. The parents might be tired, but it's part of their responsibility. However, the original question is phrased as if the author is an adult, which is confusing. But since the edit states they're a baby, the answer would be that the baby isn't in the wrong because it's a natural need. The parents have to manage their sleep accordingly. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
