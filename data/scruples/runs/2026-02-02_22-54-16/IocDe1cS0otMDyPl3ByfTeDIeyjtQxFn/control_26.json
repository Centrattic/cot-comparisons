For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in the same room because of some unstated reasons. The author is a newborn, so they don't have access to food themselves and need their parents to provide a snack.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author is a baby, so their needs are legitimate. Waking up a baby is normal, but the parents are being asked to wake up every night. However, since the parents are not working, maybe the disruption isn't as bad as if they had to be up early.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are the ones who have the resources (the snacks) and are in a position to provide. Since the baby can't help it that they're hungry at 3 AM, and their health and well-being depend on getting food, it's not their fault. The parents should adjust their schedule if possible. Also, being a newborn, their sleep cycles are different, so needing to eat frequently is natural.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because the baby isn't at fault for needing to eat and the parents are responsible for caring for them. The parents might need to find a way to make it easier, like having snacks more accessible, but the baby isn't in the wrong.\n"
