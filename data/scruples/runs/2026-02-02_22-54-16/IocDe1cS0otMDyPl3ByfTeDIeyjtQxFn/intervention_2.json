For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a newborn (so like a baby) living with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment. They've all been temporarily sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and has to wake up their parents to get a snack because the parents have all the snacks and the baby can't access them. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The baby is asking if they're at fault for waking them up every night.\n\nFirst, the baby is a newborn, which means they have basic needs that need to be met. Newborns can't feed themselves and require help from caregivers. In this case, the parents are the ones providing the snacks. Since the baby is very young, their need to eat at night is natural and necessary for their well-being. If they don't eat, they get hangry and even cry, which makes sense for a baby.\n\nThe parents aren't working, so they don't have to be up early. Waking them up at 3 AM might be inconvenient, but the baby's need is more critical. Also, the setup is temporary, so maybe this situation is expected to change once they move back to separate rooms or the baby starts eating differently.\n\nThe question is whether the baby is in the wrong. Since the baby is a newborn, it's not their fault they need to eat at night. The parents are responsible for caring for them. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. The parents are the ones who have to adjust for the baby's needs during this temporary phase.\n"
