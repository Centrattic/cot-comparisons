For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night for a 3 AM snack. The setup is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room, the author is a newborn, and the roommates (who are the author's parents) don't have jobs, so they can sleep in. The author needs the snack to avoid being hangry and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a baby, so their needs are pretty basic. Newborns typically don't have a concept of time or consider others' schedules. But since the author is writing this, maybe it's a hypothetical or a parent speaking on behalf of the baby? Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. A 6-week-old can't be the one asking this question, so maybe the parent is the author? Or perhaps it's a fictional scenario?\n\nAssuming the author is the baby's parent, then the situation is about a parent waking up their own parents (the married couple) for a snack. The parents are not working, so their mornings are flexible. The baby needs to eat, which the parent is doing at night, but the snacks are stored in one roommate's (the parent's?) place, so they have to wake them up.\n\nBut the key points here: the author is fulfilling a necessary need (feeding the baby), which is a valid reason. The roommates can sleep in since they don't have jobs. The author is trying to avoid being hungry and cranky. The roommates might be annoyed, but the author isn't at fault because it's a basic necessity, especially with a newborn. Also, since they're in the same room, waking them up is unavoidable.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could find a solution to minimize disruption, like keeping some snacks accessible? But the situation states that the snacks are all in one roommate's place, so maybe the author can't help it. Given that the roommates aren't working, the impact of being woken up might be less severe for them. Also, caring for a newborn is a significant responsibility, so the author's actions are driven by the baby's needs, not selfishness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
