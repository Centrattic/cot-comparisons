For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they all live in one room temporarily, and the author as a newborn can't access snacks without waking them up. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are reasonable. The author is a newborn, so their needs are basic. Hunger at night is normal for infants. Since they can't access snacks themselves and the parents have all the snacks, waking them up is necessary. They mention that they get hangry and even cry if they don't eat, which is typical for a baby. The parents aren't working, so they can afford to be woken up. Also, the author is a baby, so they can't be held responsible for their actions. The parents are used to caring for an infant's needs, so expecting them to stay asleep when the baby is hungry doesn't make sense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
