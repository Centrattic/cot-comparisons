For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a newborn baby living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where they're all in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and has to wake the parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so their sleep isn't as important as if they had to get up early for a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, which is a key point. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They require frequent feeding, especially in the early months. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the author is a baby. But wait, the original post mentions the author is a 6-week-old baby. But that can't be right because the person is writing a Reddit post asking about waking up roommates. That seems contradictory. Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the author is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. That's an unusual setup. Maybe the parents are acting as roommates but are actually the parents. The situation is that the baby (author) is living with their parents, all sleeping in one room, and the baby is waking the parents for snacks at night.\n\nBut the parents are not working, so their ability to sleep in is not affected. The baby's hunger is causing them to be hangry and cry, which is normal for a baby. From a practical standpoint, a 6-week-old baby can't realistically be expected to not feed when hungry. However, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a baby, they can't be at fault. But maybe the parents are being unreasonable? Wait, the parents are the ones who have all the snacks and the baby can't access them. But a 6-week-old baby can't realistically be making decisions about when to eat. The parents might be in a situation where they're not providing adequate nighttime feeding, but that's their responsibility. However, in the scenario, the parents are the roommates, so maybe the dynamics are different. It's a bit confusing. If the parents are the ones with the snacks and the baby can't access them, but the baby is a newborn, that seems odd. Newborns typically need to be fed by their parents, not take snacks from them. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The parents might be treating the baby as a roommate, but in reality, the baby is dependent on the parents for feeding. The parents might be the ones responsible for feeding the baby, not the other way around. So if the baby is waking up hungry and needs to eat, the parents should be the ones to feed the baby, not the baby taking snacks from them. This might be a case of role reversal, where the parents are acting more like roommates, but the baby's needs are urgent. However, since the author is a baby, they can't be at fault. The parents might be in the wrong if they're not providing proper care. But the question is about the author's responsibility. Since the author is a baby, the answer would be that they're not in the wrong. The parents might be the ones who need to adjust their expectations or provide better nighttime feeding so the baby isn't dependent on them waking them up for snacks. But given that it's a 6-week-old, natural feeding would involve the parents feeding the baby, not the other way around. So perhaps the setup is flawed, but the author isn't at fault.\n"
