For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about waking up roommates for a snack at 3 AM. The key points from the story are that the author is a 6-week-old baby, the roommates are the parents, and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The baby gets really hungry at night and needs a snack, which isn't accessible without waking the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The problem is waking them up every night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their needs are different from an adult. Newborns can't regulate their hunger and need to eat frequently. The parents, as roommates, are also the caregivers here. The situation is temporary, which might affect how the parents view the disturbance. Since the parents aren't working, they might have more flexibility in their sleep schedule.\n\nBut wait, the original question is whether the author (the baby) is in the wrong. Since the baby is just acting on natural needs, it's not their fault. The real issue here is more about the parents' perspective. However, the question is framed as AITA (Am I the Asshole?), but the edit clarifies that the author is a baby. So, in terms of responsibility, a baby can't be in the wrong because they don't have control over their needs. The problem is more about the parents' reaction, but the question is about the baby's actions. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. The baby's needs are legitimate and beyond their control. The parents, as caregivers, are expected to manage and accommodate the baby's schedule, even if it means some disruption initially. Since the situation is temporary, it's a normal part of having a newborn. The baby isn't at fault here.\n"
