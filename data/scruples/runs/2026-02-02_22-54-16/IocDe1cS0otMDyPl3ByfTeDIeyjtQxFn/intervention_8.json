For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking their roommates up for a snack at 3 AM. The situation is that they're all temporarily sleeping in one room because of some circumstances. The author is a newborn, and the roommates are their parents, who aren't working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A newborn has different needs compared to an adult. Hunger at night is a basic need, especially for a baby who can't eat on their own. The parents might already be used to getting up for the baby, like feeding or changing diapers. In that case, asking for a snack might be part of the routine.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. How can a baby be writing this? Maybe it's a typo or a misunderstanding. Oh, the edit says the state is MA and the author is a 6-week-old baby. The married couple are the parents. So the original question is from a baby's perspective, but that's impossible. Maybe it's a humorous or hypothetical scenario. But the parents are the ones who should be caring for the baby. If the baby is hungry at night, they should feed them, but the baby can't wake them up to get a snack from the parent. Wait, this seems conflicting. The original question says the author is the one waking up the roommates for a snack, but if the author is a baby, they can't do that. So maybe there's a mistake in the edit. Perhaps the original author is a person who's living with their parents and is considered a baby in terms of age, like a teenager or a young adult?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the edit is trying to clarify that the author is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are the parents. So the baby needs to be fed, and the parents are being woken up. But in that case, the parents are supposed to take care of the baby's needs, so waking them up is necessary. However, the parents are the ones with the snacks, so maybe the baby is trying to get a snack, but as a baby, they would be fed by the parents. Maybe there's confusion here.\n\nAssuming the author is a person living with their parents, who are the roommates, and all are in one room. The author is waking the parents up for a snack at 3 AM. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author says they get hangry and cry if they don't eat. If the author is an adult, waking up the parents every night for a snack might be considered inconsiderate, even if the parents aren't working. However, if the author has medical reasons or a condition that requires eating at night, that changes things. The edit also mentions Massachusetts as the state, but I don't think that affects the social expectation here.\n\nIn most cases, expecting roommates to be woken up every night for a snack without considering alternatives might be seen as the author's fault. However, the author claims they can't access the snacks and need it for health. If the parents are already used to being up at night for the baby, maybe it's acceptable. But if the author is an adult, this could be different. The confusion comes from the edit stating the author is a 6-week-old baby, which is impossible, so maybe it's a typo and they meant 6 months or a young adult. This is a bit confusing. Assuming the original scenario is a person living with their parents, and the parents aren't working, and the person needs a snack at 3 AM due to being hangry, the answer would depend on the relationship and mutual understanding. If the parents agreed to this arrangement, maybe not, but if it's a constant disruption without prior agreement, it's more inconsiderate. The author's reasoning that the parents can sleep in later might help, but waking them up every night could still be seen as wrong. However, the author's health and well-being are important too. So there's a balance here. Given the information, the answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit confused by the edit about the baby.\n"
