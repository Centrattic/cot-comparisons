For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that all three are living in one room temporarily. The author, who is a newborn, needs to eat late at night but doesn't have easy access to food, so they have to wake their parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nHmm, the key points here. First, the author is a newborn. Wait, the edit says they're a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that changes things. The original question was presented as an adult, but it's actually a baby. So waking up parents for feedings is normal for a newborn. Babies need to eat frequently, especially in the early weeks. The parents are the ones who take care of feeding the baby, so this is part of parenting. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased, the author is asking if they're at fault, but since it's a baby, the responsibility isn't on the baby. The parents are expected to care for the baby's needs, including feeding. So the answer would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because it's a natural part of being a newborn and the parents are there to take care of that. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any misunderstanding. The scenario mentions the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the baby needs to eat. Newborns can't control their feeding schedules, so it's not their fault. So the answer is definitely B.\n"
