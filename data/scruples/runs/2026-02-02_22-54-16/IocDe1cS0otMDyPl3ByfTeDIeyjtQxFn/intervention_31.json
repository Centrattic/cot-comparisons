For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a snack in the middle of the night. They mention that they're a newborn, so probably around 6 weeks old. They sleep in the same room as their parents temporarily. The problem is that the baby gets hungry at 2-3 AM and needs to eat, but snacks are stored with one of the parents. So they have to wake them up to get food. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby is a newborn, which means their feeding schedule is very frequent. Newborns typically need to eat every 2-3 hours because their stomachs are small and they need to gain weight. This is a common and necessary practice for infants. The parents are used to this kind of schedule, even though it's disruptive to their sleep. \n\nThe parents are not working, so they might have more flexibility. However, even without work, lack of sleep can be tough. But the baby's needs are more critical here. The baby can't go hungry for long periods because it affects their health and development. \n\nThe situation is temporary, as they're all staying in one room for a multitude of reasons (maybe a new baby, moving in together, etc.). The parents might be aware of the temporary nature and have expected this. \n\nThe key here is that the baby's needs are legitimate and necessary. Waking up for a newborn's feeding isn't a choice but a requirement. So the baby's parent isn't really \"waking them up\"; it's the baby's natural need. However, the parent who has the snacks is being asked to give them up, but since it's their own child, they should be prepared to accommodate. \n\nThe parents might be frustrated, but the baby's health and well-being take precedence. Therefore, the author (the newborn) isn't in the wrong because they can't help their feeding needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
