For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're living with their parents in a temporary setup where everyone is in one room. The author wakes up really hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs to get a snack. Since the snacks are with their parent, they have to wake them up, which also wakes the other parent. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author argues that not eating would make them hangry and even cry.\n\nFirst, the edit is super important here. The original situation mentions roommates, but the edit clarifies that they're a newborn, and the roommates are actually their parents. That changes things a lot. As a newborn, the author can't really help being hungry at night. Human babies need to eat frequently, especially if they're very young. So their need for food isn't just a personal choice but a biological necessity. \n\nNow, the parents are the ones who have the snacks, so the baby needs them to feed. But waking them up every night? Well, parents often deal with sleepless nights with their newborns. It's a common experience. However, since the parents aren't working, maybe they have more flexibility. But still, being woken up multiple times at night can be exhausting. But the key here is that the baby is a newborn, which is a temporary phase. The parents likely expected this when they had a baby. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a baby, they can't be blamed for needing to eat. The responsibility here lies with the parents to manage their sleep and provide for the baby's needs. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is a temporary one, and it's the parents' role to care for their child's needs, even if it disrupts their sleep.\n"
