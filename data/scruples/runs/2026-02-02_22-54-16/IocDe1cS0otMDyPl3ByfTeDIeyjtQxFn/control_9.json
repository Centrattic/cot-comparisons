For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM to get a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in the same room because of some unspecified reasons. The author, a newborn, needs a late-night snack but can't access food without waking up the parents. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn, so their need for frequent feeding is normal and necessary. However, the question is framed as an AITA scenario, which usually involves adult roommates. The edit clarifies that the roommates are the author's parents, but the initial part of the question refers to roommates. That might be a bit confusing, but the key point is that the parents are not working, so they aren't rushing in the morning. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's reasonable to wake up the parents every night for a snack. Since the author is a baby, they don't have control over their feeding schedule. Newborns typically need to eat every few hours, so waking up multiple times is expected. However, the parents might find this disruptive, but since they aren't working and can sleep in, the disruption might be less impactful. \n\nIn adult roommate situations, waking someone up for a snack might be considered inconsiderate, but in this case, the author is a baby, so it's a different dynamic. The parents are probably aware of the baby's needs and might be more understanding. However, the question is whether the author (as a baby) is in the wrong, which is a bit of a trick question because babies can't be blamed for their natural needs. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on the fact that the author is a newborn, making it not their fault. The parents might need to adjust for the baby's schedule, which is normal. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), as the baby isn't in the wrong for needing to eat and the parents are in a position to accommodate since they aren't working.\n"
