For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates (their parents) for a midnight snack. The situation is that they all live in a two-bedroom apartment, temporarily sharing one room. The author wakes up around 2-3 AM very hungry and has to ask their mom (since the parents have all the snacks) for food. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, but the author gets hangry and even cries if they don't eat.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author is a newborn, which I think might be a typo. Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" Oh, wait, that can't be right. The original question is from an adult perspective, but the edit says the author is a baby. That's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the original poster is a baby, but that's impossible. Let me check again. The user says \"I think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\" The edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That's a baby, but the scenario describes someone eating snacks at 3 AM, which a newborn can't do. Maybe it's a mistake. Perhaps the author meant that the baby is the one waking them up for snacks? But the original question is from the author's perspective. Hmm, maybe the user made a typo and meant the author is a parent of a newborn baby. That would make more sense. If the author is a parent with a newborn, waking up at night for feedings, that's a common situation. But the original problem is about the author waking roommates for a snack. Wait, the original question is from someone who is a baby, but that's impossible. So maybe the edit is a mistake. Let me read the original scenario again.\n\nOriginal scenario: The person lives with two roommates (married couple), all temporarily in one room. The person eats a snack at 10 PM, but wakes up at 2-3 AM hungry. The snacks are with one roommate, so they have to wake her, which wakes the other. The author would get hangry and cry if they don't eat. The parents aren't working, so waking them isn't an issue. Then the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. That's a baby, but a baby can't be eating snacks at 3 AM and asking for food. Unless it's a parent of a baby. Maybe the original author is the parent of a newborn, and the baby is waking them up for feedings. The original question might have been a mistake where the user edited it to clarify they're a baby, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the author is a parent of a baby, and the baby is the one causing the issue. But the original question says the author is waking their roommates for a snack, not the baby. This is confusing. Let me try to reconcile this.\n\nIf the author is a baby, the scenario doesn't make sense. So probably the edit is a mistake. Maybe the user intended to say that the author is a parent of a 6-week-old baby, so the author is waking up for the baby's feedings. But the original question is about the author waking roommates for a snack. So perhaps the user had a mistake in the edit. Alternatively, the user is a baby, but that's impossible. So maybe the edit is incorrect. Let's proceed assuming the edit is a mistake and the original scenario is as written.\n\nAssuming the author is an adult, living with two roommates (parents?), temporarily in one room. The author wakes up hungry at 3 AM and needs to ask one roommate for snacks, which wakes the other. The author gets very hungry and cranky if they don't eat. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nIn that case, the main issue is whether it's reasonable to wake roommates for snacks. Since the author is in a shared space, there's a need to consider others' sleep. However, the author has a legitimate need to eat to avoid being hangry. The roommates aren't working, so their sleep is less critical. But there's a balance between personal needs and others' comfort. The fact that the author has to rely on one roommate for snacks might indicate that the setup isn't ideal. Maybe the author should have their own snacks accessible. However, the situation states that the author doesn't have direct access, so the roommate holds all the snacks. That's part of the problem.\n\nIf the author can't get their own snacks, maybe there's a need to address that. But given the temporary arrangement, maybe it's a situation where they have to work together. The roommates might be understanding since they aren't working. However, waking them up every night could be disruptive. The author's need for food is valid, but there might be a better solution, like keeping some snacks in their own area or setting up a system where they can get food without waking others. But considering the current setup, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a genuine need and the roommates aren't affected in terms of work. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
