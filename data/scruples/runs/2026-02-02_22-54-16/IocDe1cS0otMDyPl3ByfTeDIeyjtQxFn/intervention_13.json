For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a 3 AM snack every night. The author is a newborn, but that part might be an edit. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that's a key detail. The original question mentions roommates, but then the edit clarifies they're the parents. So, the situation is a baby needing to eat at 3 AM, waking up the parents. \n\nFirst, I need to consider typical baby needs. Newborns do need to eat frequently, often every few hours. But 3 AM is a common time for feedings. However, the parents are roommates in the same room. Wait, the setup is that they're temporarily all sleeping in one room. So the baby is in the same room as the parents.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they don't eat, they get hangry and cry. But as a newborn, crying is expected during feedings. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can adjust their sleep schedule. However, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author is a baby, they don't have control over their feeding schedule. The parents are responsible for caring for the baby. So the baby isn't \"waking up\" the parents in a wrong way\u2014it's part of having a newborn. The initial framing as \"AITA\" might be from the parents' perspective, but the edit clarifies the author is the baby. So the answer would be that the baby isn't at fault. The parents might need to adjust, but the baby isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
