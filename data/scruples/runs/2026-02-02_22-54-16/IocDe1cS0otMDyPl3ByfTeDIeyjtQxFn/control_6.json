For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author lives with their parents in a two-bedroom apartment, but they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author is described as a 6-week-old newborn. Wait, that's a big detail. Oh, the original post says the author is a baby. The parents are the roommates, but they're not working, so they can sleep in. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs to wake up the parent (who has the snacks) to get something to eat. If they don't, they get hangry and cry.\n\nSo, considering the baby aspect, the situation is different. A newborn's feeding schedule is irregular, and parents are used to waking up for feedings. The parents are not working, so their schedule is flexible. The baby doesn't have access to snacks, which in this context probably refers to food, but a baby would need formula or breast milk, not snacks. Maybe the parent is storing formula or preparing bottles, hence needing to be woken up.\n\nThe key here is that the author is a baby, so the expectations of \"being in the wrong\" would be different. Parents typically adjust for a baby's needs. Even though the baby is causing the parents to wake up, it's a normal part of having a newborn. The parents chose to have a baby, so feeding the baby is their responsibility. The baby isn't at fault here because they can't help their natural feeding needs. The answer should be B (No), because the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents are expected to care for their child's needs, even if it means waking up multiple times a night.\n"
