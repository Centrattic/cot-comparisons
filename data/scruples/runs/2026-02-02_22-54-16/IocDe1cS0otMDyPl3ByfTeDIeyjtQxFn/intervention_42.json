For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily living in one room because of some reasons, and the author can't access snacks without waking the roommates. The roommates are the author's parents and aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author mentions they get very hangry and even cry if they don't eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a newborn? Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, wait, that's a key detail. If the author is a baby, they can't really be responsible for waking up their parents. The original question might be in the style of an AITA post, but the edit clarifies it's a baby. So, the baby can't be in the wrong because they're an infant. The parents might need to adjust the situation to feed the baby properly. But the question is phrased as if the author is the one doing it, but if it's a baby, then the parents are the ones waking up. Maybe the original poster is the parent, but the situation is written from the baby's perspective? That's confusing. Wait, the user says \"the author is a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So the author of the question is the baby, but that's impossible. Maybe it's a hypothetical written from the baby's perspective, but the real person is the parent. However, in the scenario provided, the author is the one waking up the roommates. If the author is a baby, they can't be making a choice to wake up the parents. So the real person in the situation is the parents, but the question is whether the baby is at fault. But a baby can't be at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're an infant. However, maybe the original scenario is a parent asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their own roommates (their parents) for their baby, but the question is phrased as the author being the baby. There's some confusion here. The key point is that the author is a baby, so they can't be blamed for needing to eat. The parents might need to adjust their sleeping arrangements. So the answer is B.\n"
