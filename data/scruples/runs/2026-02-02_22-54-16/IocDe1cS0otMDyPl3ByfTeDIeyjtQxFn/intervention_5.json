For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is a bit unique because the author is a newborn baby, which changes things. The roommates are the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an infant, so they can't help their hunger. The parents are not working, so they have more flexibility. The problem is that the baby is waking them up, but given that it's a baby, it's natural for them to need feeding during the night. \n\nIn most cultures, parents expect to be woken up by their infants for feeding. It's part of newborn care. The parents are used to this and can adjust their sleep. Also, since they're not working, the disruption is less of an issue compared to if they had to be up early for work.\n\nThe original question was framed as an adult scenario, but the edit changes the context entirely. The humor here is that the person is a baby, so the answer is likely B. The parents aren't really in a position to be upset about being woken up for feeding. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
