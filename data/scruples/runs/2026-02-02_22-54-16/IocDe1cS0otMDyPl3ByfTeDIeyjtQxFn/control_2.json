For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The roommates are their parents, and they're all temporarily living in one room because of some reasons. The parents aren't working, so they sleep in until 6 or 7.\n\nThe person is a newborn baby, so they can't really help with the situation. They need a snack at 3 AM because otherwise, they get really hungry and cranky. The parents have all the snacks, so the baby has to wake them up.\n\nFirst, considering the ages: the author is a baby, so they can't be held responsible for their actions. Babies can't control their need to eat. The parents are adults and should manage the situation. If the baby is hungry, they need to eat. The parents might need to adjust by keeping some snacks more accessible for the baby. Since the parents aren't working, they can prepare for the baby's needs. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're an infant.\n"
