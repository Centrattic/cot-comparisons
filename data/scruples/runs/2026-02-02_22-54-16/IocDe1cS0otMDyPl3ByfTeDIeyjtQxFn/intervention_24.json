For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a 3 AM snack. The original poster is a newborn, so they can't actually be doing this themselves, but maybe the parents are the ones feeding them, but the question is phrased as if the author is a baby, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. So the scenario is that the baby is waking up hungry at 3 AM and needs to be fed.\n\nBut since they're in the same room, the parents are already there. If the baby is eating at 3 AM, they need to be fed, which would naturally wake the parents up. However, the original question is from the baby's perspective, which is a bit odd. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in. But for a newborn, feeding every few hours is normal. However, the parents might be getting disrupted sleep because of the baby's needs. But in reality, the baby can't help that they need to eat every few hours. The parents might be expected to handle the baby's needs, even if it means waking up multiple times. The parents might be the ones feeding the baby, so the baby isn't waking them up intentionally. So maybe the baby isn't in the wrong, but the question is phrased as if the author is a person asking if they're at fault for waking up their parents. But as a newborn, the author can't be in the wrong because they're not responsible for their actions. However, the parents might have to adjust to the baby's schedule. Maybe the answer is B because the baby isn't in the wrong, but the situation is natural for a newborn. The edit also clarifies the state is MA, but that might not affect the moral aspect. The key point is that the baby's needs are essential and they can't control their hunger. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
