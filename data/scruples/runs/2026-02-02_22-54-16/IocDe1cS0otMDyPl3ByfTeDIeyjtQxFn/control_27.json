For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for waking up their roommates, which are their parents, every night at 3 AM for a snack.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author is a 6-week-old baby, which is crucial. Babies can't really have roommates or make decisions about waking them up for snacks. But the original question was framed as if the author is an adult, but the edit clarifies they're a newborn. That might be a joke or a mistake. Assuming it's a mistake, maybe the real scenario is an adult with parents, but the edit is a red herring. But the humor here is that a baby can't be responsible for their actions. \n\nIf we take the edit seriously (the author is a baby), then they can't be blamed because they're not in control. However, the original context mentions roommates and a situation where the author has to wake them up for a snack. But a baby doesn't have roommates. The parents are the ones in the apartment. So maybe the author is an adult, but the edit is a joke. \n\nAssuming the author is an adult living with their parents and temporarily in the same room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author is waking them up for a snack because they don't have access to food otherwise. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can adjust their sleep schedule. \n\nThe key points are: the author is hungry at 3 AM, which leads to being hangry. The parents aren't working, so maybe they can adjust. But waking someone up at 3 AM is pretty late. Even if the parents aren't working, they might need rest. However, the situation is temporary. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the parents are okay with it and there's no harm, maybe not. But usually, waking someone up at 3 AM for a snack, even if they're not working, is considered rude. However, the author's health and well-being are a factor. If they're getting too hungry and it's affecting them, maybe there's a solution. \n\nBut since the parents are in the same room, maybe they could adjust the setup to have snacks accessible. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with a necessity. However, the problem is that waking someone up every night is not ideal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author has a legitimate need, and the situation is temporary. Also, the parents aren't working, so they can adjust. But the edit complicates things. If the author is a baby, then they can't be blamed. If it's an adult, maybe B is the answer if the parents are understanding. But the original context might have a mistake. Assuming the edit is a joke, the answer is B. If the edit is real, answer is B (since a baby can't be blamed).\n"
