For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night around 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, which is a key detail.\n\nFirst, the author is a baby, so they can't be expected to manage hunger on their own. Infants need to eat frequently, and their schedules don't align with adult sleep patterns. The parents are the ones responsible for feeding the baby, so it's natural that they would be woken up. The fact that the parents are not working and can sleep in later might reduce their frustration since they don't have early commitments. \n\nThe situation mentions that all are temporarily in one room, so the baby doesn't have easy access to snacks, which is logical because a baby can't get food themselves. The parents are the ones with the snacks (probably breast milk or formula), so the baby needs them to feed. Waking up a baby's parents at night is a common thing, especially with newborns who need to eat every few hours. \n\nThe parents might be tired, but it's part of having a newborn. The author isn't doing this out of laziness but out of biological need. The question is whether the author is at fault, but as a baby, they can't be blamed. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the baby's needs are legitimate and unavoidable. The parents are in a situation where they have to adjust for their child's care.\n"
