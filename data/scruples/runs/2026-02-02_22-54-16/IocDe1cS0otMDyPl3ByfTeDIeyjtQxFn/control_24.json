For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for waking up their roommates (their parents) for a midnight snack. The situation is that the author, who is a 6-week-old baby, is living with their parents in a temporary arrangement where they're all in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2-3 AM and has to wake up their parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, considering the age of the author: a 6-week-old baby can't be expected to know right from wrong. They have basic needs and can't access food themselves. The parents, being the caregivers, are responsible for meeting the baby's needs, including feeding them at night. Waking up for a baby's feeding is a normal part of parenting, especially in the early months when babies need frequent feedings. The parents likely anticipated this when they had a baby. So, the baby isn't in the wrong here because they can't be held responsible for their needs. The parents are the ones who should be expected to feed the baby, even if it means waking up. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
