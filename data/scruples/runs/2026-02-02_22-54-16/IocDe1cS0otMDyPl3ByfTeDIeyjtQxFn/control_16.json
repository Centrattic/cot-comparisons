For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a newborn baby, and their parents are roommates in a temporary setup where they're all sleeping in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2-3 AM and needs to wake up the parents for a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the baby is only six weeks old, so they can't be blamed for needing to eat frequently. Newborns typically need to eat every few hours. The parents are responsible for feeding the baby, so it's part of their role as caregivers. The baby doesn't have control over their hunger or sleep schedule. Also, the parents are aware of this situation and probably expected it when they took care of a newborn. The question is if the baby is at fault for waking them up. Since the baby is an infant, it's not their responsibility to adjust their needs. The parents should handle the feeding as part of their caregiving duties. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
