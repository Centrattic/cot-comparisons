For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is a bit specific, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a newborn (6 weeks old) living with their parents, who are the married couple. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room because of some circumstances. The author is used to eating a late-night snack around 10 PM but wakes up hungry at 2 or 3 AM. Since the snacks are stored by one parent, the author has to wake them up, which also wakes the other parent because they're in the same room. The parents aren't working, so their morning schedule is flexible.\n\nThe author argues that if they don't eat at 3 AM, they'll be hangry and even cry from hunger. The parents don't have work to get to, so waking them isn't affecting their schedule. The user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nNow, considering typical roommate dynamics. Normally, waking someone up at 3 AM for a snack might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the key detail here is that the author is a newborn. Wait, that's a crucial point. If the author is a baby, then the situation is different. A baby can't help being hungry at night, and parents are expected to care for their child's needs, including feeding them. \n\nBut the original question mentions the author is an adult, given the context of roommates. Wait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" That seems contradictory. If the author is a newborn, they can't be living in an apartment with roommates. Maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. However, the edit is explicit. Perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario where the author is a baby, and the parents are acting as roommates? That's confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the edit, but according to the given info, the author is a newborn. \n\nAssuming that the author is a newborn, then the parents (roommates) are responsible for caring for them, including feeding at night. So waking them up for feedings is necessary and not their fault. If the author is an adult and made a mistake in the edit, then the situation changes. But the way the edit is written, it says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So taking that at face value, the author isn't an adult but a baby, and the parents are acting as roommates. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're an infant, and the parents are supposed to care for them. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is an adult and the edit is a mistake, then the answer would be different. But since the edit is part of the question, I have to go with that. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The newborn's needs take precedence, and the parents, as caregivers, should accommodate the baby's feeding schedule.\n"
