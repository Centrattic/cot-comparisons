For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The edit clarifies that the author is a 6-week-old baby.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the whole family is temporarily sleeping in one room. The baby is hungry at night, which is typical for infants. The parents have all the snacks, so the baby needs to wake them to get fed. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The key here is the baby's age and the necessity of feeding. \n\nBabies can't self-feed, so waking up multiple times a night is normal. The parents are responsible for the baby's needs. Even though it's every night, it's part of parenting a newborn. The question is whether the baby (author) is at fault. Since the baby can't help it and it's a biological need, the answer should be B (No). The parents understand this and are likely used to it. The original question might have been framed as a typical roommate scenario, but with the edit, the context changes to a parent-child dynamic, which changes the perspective. The baby isn't doing anything wrong; it's just part of their development stage. The parents are the ones who need to adjust, as this is a temporary phase. So the answer is B.\n"
