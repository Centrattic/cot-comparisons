For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a newborn, living with their parents in a temporary setup where everyone is sleeping in one room. The author gets hungry at 2 or 3 AM and has to wake up their parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The question is whether the author is at fault for waking them up every night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, which is a key point. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They can't regulate their hunger and need to eat frequently. However, the parents might be dealing with lack of sleep because of the baby's needs. But since the parents aren't working, maybe they can adjust their schedule. However, even if they're not working, sleep is important for their health and well-being. \n\nBut here's the thing: as a parent, they knew that having a newborn would require frequent feedings, especially in the early weeks. It's a normal part of parenting. The baby can't help it. So maybe the parents are expected to manage their own rest accordingly. On the flip side, if the situation is temporary and they're in a two-bedroom apartment but all sleeping in one room, maybe moving to separate rooms once possible could help. But the baby can't choose when to be hungry. \n\nThe author is a baby, so from a moral standpoint, they can't be held responsible for their actions. The real issue here is whether the parents should be bothered by the baby's needs. The question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), but since the author is a baby, they can't be the asshole. The parents might be the ones making the situation uncomfortable, but the baby isn't at fault. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), because the baby isn't in the wrong. They can't control their hunger and need to eat. The parents are the ones who have to adjust to the baby's needs, which is part of parenting. Unless there's an unreasonable aspect, like the baby is eating way more than necessary or the parents are being neglected, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. The baby is just following their natural needs.\n"
