For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation involves three people in one room, all roommates, with the author needing to get a snack at 2 or 3 AM. The roommates are not working, so they can sleep in. The edit mentions the author is a 6-week-old newborn, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author is a newborn, so they can't really be held responsible for their actions. The parents are the ones who are the roommates. The baby needs to eat, which is a basic necessity. Waking up the parents is part of caring for an infant. Since the parents are not working, they have the flexibility to sleep in, so the timing isn't an issue. The parents are responsible for the baby's needs, so the baby isn't in the wrong here. The original question might have been a bit confusing without the edit, but once we know it's a newborn, the answer is clear. The answer should be B (No), because the baby can't be blamed for needing to eat and waking up the parents is part of their care. The parents are there to take care of the baby, so it's not the baby's fault.\n"
