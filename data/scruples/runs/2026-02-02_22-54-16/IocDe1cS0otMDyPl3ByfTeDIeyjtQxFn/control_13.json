For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a newborn living with their parents in a temporary setup where everyone is in one room. The baby gets hungry around 2 or 3 AM and needs to wake up the parents for a snack because they don't have access to food otherwise. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here are that the author is a baby, which is really important. The question is about waking up roommates for a snack, but since they're a newborn, the context changes. Newborns have very different needs compared to adults. They need to eat frequently, often every few hours. The parents are the ones responsible for feeding the baby, so waking them up at night is part of parenting. \n\nThe original question was framed as a roommate situation, but the edit clarifies that the roommates are actually the parents. In a typical roommate scenario, waking people up for snacks could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's a regular occurrence. However, when it's a baby and the parents, the dynamic is different. Parents are expected to take care of their child's needs, even at night. The baby isn't in control of the situation; they have biological needs that require the parents to respond.\n\nAlso, the baby can't prepare snacks themselves and relies entirely on the parents. Since the parents are the ones with the snacks and the baby can't access them, the situation isn't the baby's fault. The parents are aware of this arrangement and have chosen to be in this living situation. The baby's hunger leading to being hangry and crying is a natural response, but as a newborn, they can't help that. The question of being in the wrong doesn't really apply here because it's part of the parents' role to care for the baby's needs, even at night. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The situation is a normal part of parenting a newborn, and the baby's needs take precedence here.\n"
