For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that they live with their parents (since the edit mentions they're a newborn and the roommates are a married couple, probably the parents). They're all temporarily in one room because of some reasons. The person wakes up around 2 or 3 AM hungry, and since they don't have access to snacks, they have to wake up their parent (and the other parent) to get something to eat. They mention that if they don't eat, they get hangry and even cry from hunger. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the person is a newborn, so maybe the parent is caring for them during the night. Wait, no, the user says they're a 6-week-old baby, but the author is the baby? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby, and the married couple are their parents. Oh, so the original post is written from the perspective of a baby, but that's probably a joke or a typo. Wait, maybe it's a mistake. Let me check again. The edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents.\" So the author is a baby, but the original question was about waking up roommates for a snack. That's confusing. A baby can't write this. Maybe it's a humorous edit, but perhaps it's meant to shift the situation. If the person is a baby, then of course they can't be in the wrong because they're an infant. But the original post didn't mention that initially. So the edit is probably a twist to change the context. However, the original question is from the perspective of someone who is a baby, which is probably a joke. Maybe the user intended to say that the parents are acting like newborns? Or maybe it's a mistake. Let me think. If the author is a baby, then needing to eat at night is normal. But if the edit is just a joke, then the original scenario is a person waking up roommates for snacks as an adult, which might be different. However, the edit is part of the question, so the answer should consider that. So taking the edit seriously, the person is a baby, and the parents are the roommates. In that case, the baby is waking up the parents for snacks. Since babies need to eat frequently, especially at night, the parents should expect that. So the answer would be B, the baby isn't in the wrong. However, the original post's framing is confusing because a baby can't be asking this question. So maybe the edit is a humorous twist, but we have to take it as given. So the author is a baby, so their actions are normal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
