For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The key points here are that they share an apartment with their parents, all are in one room temporarily. They need a snack at that hour because they get very hungry and would be cranky otherwise. Their parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, considering the context that it's Massachusetts and the person is a newborn. Wait, wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that's a big detail. The original question was presented as \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.\" So from the start, the situation is that a baby is waking up parents for a snack. But the parents are not working, so they have the flexibility.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"AITA for waking my roommates up for a snack?\" with the edit explaining that the roommates are actually the parents. So the baby is the author, but in reality, the baby is just doing what's natural\u2014feeding at night. However, the parents might have their own concerns about being disturbed, but since they're not working, it's a temporary situation. The parents are responsible for the baby's care, so the baby isn't in the wrong. The parents might need to adjust their expectations when they're living with their child. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
