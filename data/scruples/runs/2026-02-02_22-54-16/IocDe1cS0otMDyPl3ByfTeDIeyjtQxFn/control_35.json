For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. But looking at the edit, it says the author is a 6-week-old baby. Oh, that changes things.\n\nSo, the original question is from the perspective of someone who might be a child, but the edit clarifies they are a newborn. The roommates are the parents. Now, a baby can't really wake up roommates on purpose for a snack. They just have natural needs, like eating when hungry. Since they're an infant, they don't have the ability to control their hunger or timing. \n\nThe parents are the ones responsible for taking care of the baby's needs. It's normal for infants to need frequent feeding, even at night. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in and handle the baby's needs. There's no wrongdoing here because the baby isn't making a choice to wake people up; it's just how their body works. The situation is different because of the age clarification. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
