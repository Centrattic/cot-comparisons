For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The original question was posted on AITA (Am I the Asshole), which is a subreddit where people ask if they're being a jerk in certain situations.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The person lives in a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates, a married couple. They're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The person often eats a late-night snack at 10 PM but gets hungry again around 2-3 AM. They don't have easy access to snacks, so they have to wake up one of the roommates, who ends up waking the other as well. The roommates aren't working, so they can sleep in. The key point is that the person is a 6-week-old baby, and the roommates are their parents.\n\nWait, that's a big detail. The original post was edited to mention that the author is a newborn. That changes everything because a baby can't really be making decisions to wake up their parents for snacks. So the real question here is whether the parents are being unreasonable by being upset about their baby waking them up for food.\n\nIn the context of a baby, waking up multiple times at night for feeding is normal and necessary. Parents of newborns typically adjust their schedules to accommodate their baby's needs. The baby isn't doing it on purpose; it's a biological necessity for growth and comfort. Since the parents aren't working, they have the flexibility to care for the baby's needs without the added stress of morning responsibilities.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents are the ones responsible for the baby's well-being. The baby isn't at fault here because they can't control their hunger or feeding schedules. The parents might find it tiring, but it's a temporary phase. As the baby grows, the frequency of night feedings should decrease. The parents should manage their own rest by possibly adjusting their sleeping arrangements or finding ways to rest during the day.\n\nIn terms of the original question, the answer hinges on the baby's age. Since the edit clarifies the baby is just 6 weeks old, the person (the baby) isn't in the wrong. The parents are the ones dealing with the situation, and they're the ones who need to adjust. There's no wrongdoing from the baby's side because it's a natural part of infant care.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the baby can't be held responsible for waking up their parents for necessary feeding. The parents need to adapt to the baby's needs, which is a common aspect of parenting.\n"
