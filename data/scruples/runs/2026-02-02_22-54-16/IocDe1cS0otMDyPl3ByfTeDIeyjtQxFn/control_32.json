For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for waking up their roommates for a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in one room because of some reasons. The writer is a newborn, and the parents are the roommates. The baby gets hungry at 3 AM and needs a snack, but the parents have all the snacks, so the baby has to wake them up.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The baby is six weeks old, which is a very young infant. Newborns have irregular sleep patterns and need to eat frequently. The parents are not working, so they have the flexibility to sleep in. The baby can't access food on their own, so waking the parents up to get a snack is necessary for the baby's well-being. The baby mentions that not eating would lead to being hangry, crying, etc., which makes sense for an infant.\n\nNow, considering the parents are the roommates, but in reality, the parents are the primary caregivers. Even though they are in a shared living situation, the baby's needs are critical. The parents would likely be aware of the baby's feeding schedule. However, the question is framed as an AITA scenario, which usually involves social dynamics and etiquette. But given the baby's age, the situation is more about basic survival needs rather than social etiquette.\n\nIn typical AITA contexts, if an adult is waking others up for snacks, it might be considered inconsiderate. But this is a newborn, so the expectations are different. The baby can't be held responsible for their actions. The parents are the ones who need to manage the situation, perhaps by having snacks more accessible or adjusting their sleeping arrangements if possible.\n\nThe edit also mentions the state is Massachusetts, but since it's about a newborn, legal considerations might not apply here. The question is more about moral obligation. The baby isn't at fault here. The parents might need to find solutions to minimize disruption, like keeping some snacks in a place the baby can reach, but the baby isn't doing anything wrong by needing to eat.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the baby's needs are essential and beyond their control. Roommate dynamics don't apply in the same way when dealing with a newborn's basic requirements.\n"
