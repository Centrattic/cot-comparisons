For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that all three are temporarily sleeping in one room. The parents have all the snacks, and the author, a newborn, can't access them without waking them up. The author gets really hungry and cranky if they don't eat at 3 AM. Also, the parents aren't working, so they can sleep in.\n\nFirst, the author is a newborn. That's a crucial detail. Newborns need to eat frequently, often every few hours. Their hunger isn't something they can control. The parents are the caregivers, so their responsibility includes feeding the baby. The parents aren't working, so their schedule is flexible. Waking them up for a feeding is part of parenting, especially in the early months. The baby isn't at fault here because they can't help their needs. The parents should be accommodating, even if it's inconvenient. The question of right or wrong doesn't really apply to a newborn; they're just acting on biological needs. The parents might be exhausted, but that's part of having a newborn. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
