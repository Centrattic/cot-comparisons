For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for waking up their roommates every night at 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that all three are sharing a room temporarily. The author is a newborn, so that's a key detail.\n\nFirst, the roommates are the author's parents, and they're not working. The author needs a snack at 3 AM but can't access it without waking them up. The author mentions that without the snack, they become very hungry and even cry. The parents are asleep, so the author has to wake them.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author\u2014six weeks old\u2014this changes things. A newborn can't realistically be expected to stay awake until 6 or 7 AM. Infants need to eat frequently, often every few hours. If the parents are not working, they might be more flexible with the baby's schedule. However, the setup is that the parents have all the snacks, so the baby has to wake them up to get food. This seems like a logistical issue. Maybe the parents could adjust their storage to make snacks more accessible for the baby? But a baby can't just help themselves to snacks; they need assistance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the baby is hungry, it's natural for the parents to feed them. But the parents are being woken up every night. However, given that the baby is their own child, it's part of parenting to adjust sleep schedules. The question is whether the baby is at fault. Since the baby is a newborn, it's not their fault. The parents might need to adjust how they manage the snacks to avoid waking each other, maybe by having the snacks in a baby-proof container the baby can access with help, or perhaps the parents take turns feeding the baby. \n\nBut the question is framed as AITA (Am I the Asshole), and the baby is the one asking. Since the baby can't be at fault here, the answer would be B. The parents might need to adjust their setup to accommodate the baby's needs without being woken up unnecessarily. However, given the baby's age, frequent feedings are normal. The parents should be aware that their child needs to eat every few hours, so maybe the real issue is how the snacks are stored. But since the baby is the one asking, the answer is B.\n"
