For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are actually their parents, as revealed in the edit) every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The author is a newborn, so that's a key point.\n\nFirst, the parents are not working, so their schedules might be more flexible. The author is hungry and becomes \"hangry/cranky,\" which can affect the household dynamics. However, since the author is a baby, their needs are more critical. Babies need regular feeding, and they can't help waking people up if they're hungry. The parents, being the caregivers, are responsible for the baby's needs. The initial setup mentions that the snacks are stored with one roommate (the mother), so the baby's access is limited, leading to the need to wake someone up. \n\nConsidering the edit that clarifies the parents are the roommates, the situation changes. Parents are expected to care for their child, including feeding them at night. The author isn't a teenager or adult making choices; it's a baby. So waking the parents up for a snack is necessary for the baby's well-being. The parents should adjust their schedules or storage to accommodate the baby's needs. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because it's a baby's natural need, and the parents are responsible for that care.\n"
