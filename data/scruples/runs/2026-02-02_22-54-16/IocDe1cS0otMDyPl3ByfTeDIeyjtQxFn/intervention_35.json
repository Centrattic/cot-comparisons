For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a newborn living with their parents, sharing a room. They need a snack at 3 AM but can't get it themselves because the parents have all the snacks. So they wake the parents up every night. The parents aren't working, so maybe they don't need to sleep early.\n\nFirst, the author is a baby, which is a key point. Newborns don't have control over their eating schedules; they need to eat when they're hungry. The parents are the ones who are responsible for feeding them, so it's part of their role as parents. Even though the baby is waking them up, it's a natural part of having a newborn. The parents are aware of the situation and probably expected this when they took on the responsibility of caring for a baby. \n\nAlso, the parents aren't working, so they don't have to be up early. Waking up at 3 AM for a baby is common during those early months. The baby can't help it, and the parents are there to take care of their needs. So the author isn't being inconsiderate because they're a baby. The parents should understand that this is temporary and part of having a newborn. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
