For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for waking up their roommates to get a snack at 3 AM. The situation involves three people sharing a room, with the author being a newborn. The parents aren't working, so they sleep in. The author can't access snacks without waking them.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the age of the author and the living arrangement. Since the author is a newborn, they probably can't eat a regular snack. But the parents are providing care, so maybe they need to feed the baby. However, the scenario mentions waking the parents up for a snack every night. If the baby is eating a snack, that's unusual because newborns typically feed on demand, like with breast milk or formula. But if the baby is actually the author, then the question is if the parents should be woken for feeding. In that case, it's normal for newborns to feed frequently, even at night. However, the parents aren't working, so maybe they can adjust their schedule. But the parents might need rest. On the other hand, if the author is an adult pretending to be a baby, that's a different scenario. The edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn/baby, so the parents are taking care of them. In that case, the parents have a responsibility to care for the baby, which includes feeding. So waking them for feedings isn't the author's fault. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because the baby's needs come first, and the parents are supposed to care for them. But if the author is an adult, then A. But according to the edit, it's a newborn. So B is correct.\n"
