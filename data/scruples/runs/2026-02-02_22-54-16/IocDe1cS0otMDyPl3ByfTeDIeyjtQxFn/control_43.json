For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author waking up their roommates (their parents) at 3 AM every night for a snack because they can't access food otherwise.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The author is a newborn, so they're 6 weeks old. The roommates are the parents, and they're all temporarily sleeping in one room. The author needs to eat at 3 AM but can't reach the snacks, which are with one of the parents. So they wake up the parents to get a snack. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in, and the author gets hangry/crying if they don't eat at that time. \n\nNow, the author is a baby, which is crucial. As a newborn, their needs are basic and frequent. They can't prepare food themselves, so relying on parents for feeding is normal. The parents are awake anyway because the baby is up. The parents being the roommates here adds context but since they're the parents, the dynamic is more about parental responsibility than roommates. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the baby isn't responsible for their actions here. The real question is whether the parents are managing the situation appropriately. However, the question is about the author (the baby) being in the wrong. Since the baby can't be held responsible, the answer would be B (No). The parents might need to address how to make feeding easier for the baby without being disturbed, but the baby isn't at fault. The edit clarifying the baby's age and relationship to the parents changes the initial interpretation from roommates to parents, making the situation a normal parent-child dynamic where the baby's needs are legitimate.\n"
