For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are actually their parents) every night for a 3 AM snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily in one room because of some reasons, and the author (who's a baby) needs a snack at night but can't access it without waking someone up.\n\nFirst, the author is a newborn, so their needs are pretty basic. As a baby, they probably can't eat on their own and rely on caregivers. The parents aren't working, so they're not busy in the morning. Waking them up at 3 AM might be inconvenient, but the baby's need for food is urgent. \n\nBabies need to eat frequently, especially in the early months. If the author is a human baby, then it's completely normal and necessary to wake the parents for feedings. However, the edit says the author is a \"6 week old newborn/baby,\" which might be a typo or a joke, but assuming it's a real baby, then waking them is part of the parents' responsibility. \n\nBut wait, the original question uses \"author\" as the person asking. If the author is a baby, they can't write the post themselves, so maybe it's a humorous or hypothetical scenario. But if we take it literally, the parents are the ones responsible for feeding the baby. If the baby can't access snacks on their own, then the parents need to be there to help. \n\nHowever, if the author is an adult pretending to be a baby (as a joke), then the situation is different. But the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, so they probably mean the literal scenario of a baby needing food. In that case, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong because the baby's needs are necessary and the parents are there to care for them. \n\nBut if the author is an adult and the situation is real (maybe a mistake in the edit), then waking roommates every night for snacks would be inconsiderate. But the edit clearly states the author is a baby, so the answer leans towards B. The key is that the baby's needs are essential, and parents are expected to care for them, even if it disrupts their sleep. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
