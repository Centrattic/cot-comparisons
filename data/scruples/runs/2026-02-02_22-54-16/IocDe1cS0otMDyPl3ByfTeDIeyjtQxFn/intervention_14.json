For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (who are their parents) for a snack at 3 AM. The author is a newborn, so maybe that's a joke, but the real scenario is that they're all in a shared room. The parents aren't working, so they can sleep in. The author gets really hungry and hangry if they don't eat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a baby, right? So maybe the initial statement is a joke, but the actual situation might be different. Wait, the edit says the author is a 6-week-old newborn. Oh, that's a baby. But the original question is written as if the author is an adult. That's confusing. Maybe it's a humorous twist.\n\nIf the author is a baby, then waking up the parents for feedings is normal. Babies need to eat frequently, especially at night. Parents expect to be woken up for feedings. So in that case, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But the original post seems to be written in the first person as an adult, which is conflicting. The edit might be a joke or a red herring.\n\nWait, the edit says \"I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents.\" So the story is written from the baby's perspective, which is a humorous way to present the situation. So the actual scenario is a baby needing to feed at night, and the parents are the roommates. In reality, babies waking up for feedings is expected and not the baby's fault. So the answer would be B. But if the original scenario was meant to be taken literally (a grown adult waking roommates for snacks), then maybe different. But the edit clarifies it's a baby. So the answer is B.\n"
