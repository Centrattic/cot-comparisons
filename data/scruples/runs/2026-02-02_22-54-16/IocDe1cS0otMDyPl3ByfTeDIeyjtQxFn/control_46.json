For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby. The married couple are my parents. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for waking up their roommates (their parents) every night at 2 or 3 AM for a snack. The situation is that they're all temporarily in one room, and the parents have the snacks. The writer, a newborn, can't access food without waking them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer is a baby, but the situation is framed as a human adult. Wait, the edit says the state is Massachusetts and the author is a 6-week-old baby. Wait, that's a baby, but the original question is phrased as if the author is an adult. There's a contradiction here. The original scenario says the author is a baby, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. But babies can't be in the wrong in the same way adults can. Maybe there's a mistake here. The edit clarifies that the author is a newborn, and the roommates are the parents. So, the real question is whether the parents are in the wrong for waking up for their baby's needs. But the question is framed as if the author is the one in the wrong. That's confusing. \n\nWait, the original setup says the author is a baby, but the parents are the ones who have the snacks. So the baby wakes them up to get a snack. But a baby can't choose to wake up parents for a snack; that's part of parenting. So maybe the scenario is a humorous or hypothetical question where the baby is being treated as if they're an adult. The parents are not working, so they can sleep in. The baby gets cranky if not fed. In reality, parents are expected to feed their babies even at night. But if this is a hypothetical where the baby is considered an adult roommate, then waking up parents every night for a snack would be unreasonable. But since it's a baby, the answer would be different. \n\nThe problem is the question is phrased as if the author is an adult, but the edit says they're a baby. The options are A or B for the author being in the wrong. If the author is a baby, they can't be in the wrong. But if the question is a hypothetical where the author is an adult, then waking up parents every night for a snack would be inconsiderate. However, the original scenario states that the author is a baby. The confusion arises because the question format is similar to AITA (Am I the Asshole?) where the person is an adult. The edit clarifies the state and the baby part. \n\nSo the real issue is whether the baby (author) is in the wrong. Since it's a baby, they can't be in the wrong. But the format of the question is for an adult. There's a mix-up here. The answer would depend on whether we take the author as a baby or an adult. If it's a baby, answer B (not in the wrong). If it's an adult, answer A. The edit clarifies the baby part, so the answer is B. But the original scenario might have been a mistake. The key here is the edit that says the author is a baby. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), as a baby can't be held accountable for needing to be fed.\n"
