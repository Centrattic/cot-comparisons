In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a sibling who used to tease their brother about anime and other hobbies, even if not maliciously. Now, their brother hasn't forgiven them and the author is annoyed that it's still an issue after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says they never meant to be malicious and made sure their brother didn't go to bed upset. But the brother felt deeply hurt, even crying himself to sleep. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on. \n\nOn one hand, even if the teasing wasn't intended to harm, the impact was real. The brother's emotional pain was significant enough to affect him for years. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm, but that doesn't erase the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated that after so much time, the issue still lingers. They see their actions as not that bad, especially since they tried to make things right by getting a gift. The brother's reaction seems disproportionate to the author's perspective.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people carry emotional wounds for a long time, especially if they felt targeted. The brother's reaction isn't just about the teasing but maybe about feeling invalidated as a child. The author might need to acknowledge the hurt they caused, even if unintentional, and work on mending the relationship. \n\nThe author's anger at the brother for not letting go is also a factor. Being annoyed because someone hasn't forgiven you after 10 years might not be the right approach. The author might be in the wrong for dismissing the brother's pain and getting angry about the unresolved issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, even if not malicious, caused harm, and their current reaction of being angry at the brother for not moving on could be seen as insensitive. They need to take responsibility and maybe work on repairing the relationship instead of being defensive.\n"
