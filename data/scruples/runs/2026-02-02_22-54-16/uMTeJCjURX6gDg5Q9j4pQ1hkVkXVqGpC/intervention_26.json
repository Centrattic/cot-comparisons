In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother not forgiving him for teasing him about anime as a kid. The author is 26, his brother 23. The brother still hasn't forgiven him, even though he tried to give a thoughtful gift. The brother confronted him, saying he made him cry and feel embarrassed. The author is angry that his brother hasn't moved on after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the teasing as a child, the impact on the brother, and the current conflict. The author says he didn't mean it maliciously and never let the brother go to sleep upset. However, the brother felt deeply hurt, to the point of crying. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm, but the brother's feelings are real. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Bullying, even if not malicious, can have lasting effects. The fact that the brother was teased about his hobbies, leading him to feel ashamed and cry, suggests that the author's behavior was harmful. The author might have seen it as harmless teasing, but the impact was significant. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother hasn't forgiven him for over a decade, which the author now sees as throwing away their relationship. The author is upset about being angry at the brother's lack of forgiveness. The brother's reaction is valid because past trauma can linger. However, the author might not have taken responsibility until now. \n\nThe author's initial intent wasn't malicious, but the consequences were real. The brother's emotional response is valid, so the author could be in the wrong for not recognizing the harm sooner. However, the brother's refusal to forgive after so long might be his issue. But the question is about the author's actions. The answer depends on whether the teasing was wrong to begin with. Since it caused lasting harm, even if unintended, the author might be partially at fault. But since he tried to make amends with the gift and was surprised by the depth of the hurt, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nHmm. The options are A for yes, B for no. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But considering the brother's experience, maybe the author is in the wrong. But since he didn't do it maliciously, maybe not. This is a tough one. The key is that even if not malicious, the behavior caused significant harm. So perhaps the author is in the wrong (A). But some might argue that the brother is holding a grudge too long. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely is A because the teasing had a negative impact, even if unintended.\n"
