In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author, a 26-year-old, is frustrated that their younger brother (23) hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime and other nerdy hobbies as a child. The brother confronted them on his birthday, saying the teasing made his teenage years miserable and that he used to cry himself to sleep because of it. Now, the author is annoyed that the brother hasn't let go of this after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the nature of the teasing. The author admits they were a bully, even if not malicious. Teasing can be a form of bullying, especially if it's persistent and targeted. The brother, who was into anime and games, felt embarrassed and isolated because of it. Even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, the impact was real\u2014leading to the brother's emotional distress and a strained relationship.\n\nThe author's current frustration is about the brother not moving past it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author's actions, while maybe not intended to be harmful, had a lasting negative effect. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional impact of childhood bullying can last into adulthood. The author might not have seen their actions as serious, but the brother did, and that's his experience.\n\nAlso, the author now seems defensive, thinking the brother is overreacting. The brother, on the other hand, had a legitimate reason to feel hurt and took time to process and confront the issue. The author might need to consider that even if the teasing was light-hearted from their perspective, it wasn't from the brother's. The fact that the brother was cold towards them for years and only confronts it when given a gift shows that the hurt was buried and significant.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author initiated the harmful behavior. Even if not malicious, bullying\u2014even in the form of teasing\u2014can lead to long-term emotional scars. The brother's reaction isn't about throwing away the relationship but addressing past pain that hasn't healed. The author's anger at the brother not letting go might stem from not fully understanding the depth of the hurt caused.\n\nSo, based on this, the author did contribute to the brother's suffering through their actions as a child, even if unintended. The fact that the brother is still affected shows the lasting impact. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the initial bullying and for being angry that the brother hasn't moved on, rather than addressing the harm done. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
