In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author used to tease their brother about anime and hobbies when they were younger. The brother is still upset, even after years, and the author is annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The author claims they didn't mean to be malicious and that they never let their brother go to bed upset. They also mention trying to make amends with a gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of bullying. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, if it caused emotional harm, it's still an issue. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep, which indicates significant emotional distress. The author might not have realized the impact of their actions at the time, but that doesn't negate the harm done.\n\nThe author is now angry that their brother hasn't moved on. But holding onto past hurt is common, especially if it affected self-esteem. The brother's reaction shows that the emotional scars are still there. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt or feeling that they've done enough by trying to make amends.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author didn't intend to harm, but the impact was harmful. The brother's feelings are valid, even if the author's intentions were different. The author's anger at the brother not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's ongoing pain. However, the author isn't denying their past actions or refusing to acknowledge the brother's feelings now. They did try to give a thoughtful gift, which shows they care.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions contributed to the brother's emotional state. Even if they didn't mean to be a bully, they still acted in a way that caused harm. The brother's right to feel upset is valid. However, the author's current anger at the brother not moving on might be where they're in the wrong. They need to consider that healing takes time and that their brother's feelings are legitimate.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for their past actions or their current reaction. The past actions, while unintentional, did cause harm, so they bear some responsibility. But the current reaction might be less about being an asshole and more about needing to understand the brother's perspective better. However, since the author's actions had a negative impact, they might still share some blame even if they didn't intend it.\n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given the analysis, the author's actions had harmful consequences, making them at least partially responsible. So the answer might be A. However, some might argue that the brother's ongoing anger is also an issue. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, the answer would lean towards A.\n"
