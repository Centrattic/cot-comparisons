In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The situation involves the author having teased his brother about his anime hobbies as a child and young teen. The brother has held onto that resentment for a decade, leading to a falling out even now.\n\nFirst, the author admits they were a bit of a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious. They teased the brother about anime, which was important to him. The key points here are that the teasing happened over a significant period, and the author didn't realize the emotional impact it had. The brother now expresses that it made his teenage years miserable, causing him to cry and feel embarrassed. \n\nThe author is frustrated because they believe the teasing wasn't that bad and that it's been 10 years. They feel angry that their brother hasn't forgiven them and is maintaining a cold relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the author didn't mean harm, the actions had a lasting negative effect on their sibling. Bullying or teasing, even among siblings, can have deep emotional consequences. The fact that the brother felt ashamed of his interests and cried himself to sleep indicates that the behavior crossed the line from playful teasing to harmful bullying.\n\nThe author's current anger at the brother for not forgiving them might be valid in terms of feeling wronged by the resentment, but the initial behavior is what's being judged here. The brother's reaction shows that the impact was significant. The author's actions, while perhaps not intended to be malicious, still caused lasting harm. Therefore, the author is responsible for their actions, even if they didn't mean to hurt their brother.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong now for being angry, that's a bit more complex. Holding onto resentment is not healthy, but the brother's feelings are valid. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the pain they caused. However, the question is about the author's initial actions. Since they acknowledge they were a bully, even if unintentionally, they are in the wrong for causing that harm. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
