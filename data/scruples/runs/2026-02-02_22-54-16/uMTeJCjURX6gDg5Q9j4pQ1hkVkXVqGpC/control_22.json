In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who used to tease the other about anime and hobbies when they were younger. Now, the younger brother hasn't forgiven him, and the older one is annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The older brother admits he was a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. He says he never let the other go to sleep upset but still teased him a lot. The younger brother was into anime, which the older brother didn't like, so he made fun of that. Over time, their relationship got colder, and even after years, the younger brother is still upset, saying it made his teen years miserable and he cried.\n\nThe older brother is now angry that his brother hasn't let it go after 10 years. He sent a gift for his birthday, which was appreciated but maybe not wholeheartedly. Then the younger brother lashed out, causing tension.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the older brother was in the wrong. Even if he didn't mean to be malicious, teasing someone repeatedly over a long period can be harmful. The younger brother's feelings are valid\u2014being made to feel like a \"weirdo\" and crying over it shows that the teasing had a lasting impact. The fact that the older brother didn't realize the extent of the harm until the recent outburst suggests he might not have considered the depth of his brother's feelings. \n\nThe older brother's reaction now is anger at his brother for not letting it go, which could indicate he's not taking responsibility for his past actions. Even if the teasing wasn't intended to be mean, the effect was there. The younger brother's right to feel hurt isn't negated by the older brother's lack of malice. So, the author (the older brother) might be in the wrong for both the teasing and for being angry about the ongoing hurt feelings. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The first part is about the bullying, the second part is about being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the brother's reaction is justified (he was harmed), the author's teasing was wrong, even if not malicious. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go could also be seen as dismissive of the brother's valid feelings. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
