In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who felt bullied by his sibling for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author says he never meant it maliciously and they even bonded over video games. But now, the brother is still upset, even after 10 years, and the author is angry that he hasn't moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the brother. Teasing can be more than just harmless fun, especially if it makes someone feel embarrassed or ashamed. The brother admitted that he used to cry himself to sleep because he felt like a weirdo. Even if the author didn't mean it to be malicious, the effect on his brother was real and harmful. The brother's feelings of being a weirdo might have impacted his self-esteem during his formative years, which is significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset that his brother hasn't forgiven him after so long. He feels like the teasing wasn't that bad and is frustrated that their relationship is suffering because of it. The author's intentions might have been innocent, but the outcome matters here. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional impact of bullying, even if light, can linger into adulthood.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author might not have intended harm, but the impact on his brother was negative. The brother's current behavior (lashing out) is a result of past trauma, which the author's actions contributed to. However, the author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of the issue. \n\nBut considering that the brother is now in university and relatively popular, maybe the author is right to question why it's still a problem. However, the fact that the brother felt ashamed and cried because of the teasing means that the author's actions did cause harm, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were wrong. If the teasing was consistent and caused emotional distress, then even if not malicious, it's still harmful. The author might not be a bad person, but the behavior contributed to his brother's ongoing hurt. Therefore, in this context, the author is in the wrong for the bullying, even if unintended, because it had a lasting negative effect.\n"
