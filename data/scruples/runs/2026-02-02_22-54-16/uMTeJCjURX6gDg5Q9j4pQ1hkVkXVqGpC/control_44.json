In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased by his sibling about anime and other hobbies, leading to long-term resentment.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about anime, which the brother was into. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to hurt, the impact matters. The brother felt embarrassed and cried, which is significant emotional harm. The author didn't realize the extent of the hurt until years later.\n\nThe brother's reaction is strong\u2014ten years later, he's still not forgiving. But the author is now upset that their brother hasn't let go. The key here is that bullying, even if not intended, can have lasting effects. The fact that the brother was cold towards the author for years shows ongoing damage. The author might not have seen the harm, but that doesn't negate the brother's feelings.\n\nThe author's anger at the brother for not forgiving after a decade is part of the issue. Holding onto past hurt is complicated, but the author's frustration might stem from not taking responsibility for their actions. The author gave a gift, which was a kind gesture, but the brother's reaction revealed deeper wounds. The author's response was to get angry at the brother's unresolved feelings rather than reflecting on their own role.\n\nSo, considering the impact of their actions and the failure to acknowledge the brother's pain until it was too late, the author is in the wrong. Their bullying behavior, even if unintentional, caused lasting harm. The anger at the brother for not moving on also shows a lack of empathy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
