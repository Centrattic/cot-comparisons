In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is an older brother who, as a child and young teen, teased his younger brother about his anime hobbies. The younger brother, now 23, still hasn't forgiven him for that and expressed his hurt feelings. The author is now annoyed that his brother hasn't moved on after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong for his past actions. The key points here are that the teasing was not malicious but still affected his brother deeply. The author claims he never meant to hurt him and that they didn't sleep angry, but the brother felt embarrassed and cried himself to sleep. The fact that the brother's feelings were hurt for a long time suggests that even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, it was harmful. Bullying isn't always about physical harm; emotional and psychological effects count too.\n\nNext, the author's current reaction is anger at the brother for not letting go of the past. The brother is 23, so the events happened over a decade ago. The author is frustrated that his brother still holds a grudge. However, if the brother felt genuinely traumatized and invalidated, it's reasonable for him to take time to heal. The author's annoyance at his brother's unresolved feelings could be seen as dismissive of the brother's emotional experience.\n\nThe author also gave a gift related to the brother's interests, which seems like a positive step, but the brother's reaction indicates that past actions have left a lasting impact. The author might not fully grasp the depth of the emotional damage, thinking the teasing wasn't that bad. However, the brother's experience is valid, and the author's role in that is significant. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the impact matters. The author might need to take responsibility for how his actions affected his brother, rather than getting angry that the brother is still upset. The key issue here is whether the author's past actions were harmful, and if his current reaction is inconsiderate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions as a child were wrong in the sense that they hurt his brother emotionally, even if unintended. His current frustration at his brother's unresolved feelings is also a problem because it shows a lack of understanding for the brother's experience. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
