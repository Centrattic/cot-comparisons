In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The story is about the author being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The brother is still holding a grudge after ten years, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully, but claims it was not malicious and that they never let the brother go to bed upset. However, the brother reveals that the teasing made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of this after so long.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author's actions as a child\u2014teasing about hobbies and interests\u2014could be seen as bullying, even if unintentional. If it caused emotional harm, like making someone feel embarrassed or cry, that's a valid issue. The fact that the brother still hasn't forgiven them after a decade shows that the impact was significant.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mean harm and tried to make amends by giving a thoughtful gift. They are now upset that the brother hasn't moved on. However, holding a grudge for ten years might be seen as excessive, but the brother's right to feel hurt isn't invalidated by the passage of time. The author's frustration at the brother's continued resentment is understandable, but that doesn't negate the original harm caused.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author's past behavior was harmful, even if not malicious. 2) The brother's feelings are valid, and the long-held grudge indicates lasting emotional impact. 3) The author's current anger might be a reaction to feeling unfairly judged for past actions, but does that make them in the wrong?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent versus impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the impact was real. The brother's right to feel wronged still stands. The author's annoyance at the brother's unresolved anger doesn't absolve them of the earlier actions. Therefore, the author is partially responsible for the initial bullying, which is why the brother hasn't forgiven them. However, the brother's long-held grudge could be seen as unhealthily persistent, but that doesn't make the author right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong now because they're angry about the brother's lack of forgiveness. \n\nBut the initial harm was done, so the author is in the wrong for the original bullying, even if unintentional. The current frustration might be understandable, but the core issue is the past behavior. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their past actions caused significant harm, even if they didn't intend it. However, the brother's holding a grudge for ten years is also a factor, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author's actions caused the issue, they are in the wrong.\n"
