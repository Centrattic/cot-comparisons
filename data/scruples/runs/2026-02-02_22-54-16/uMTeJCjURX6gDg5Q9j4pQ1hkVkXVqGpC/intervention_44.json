In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the Reddit-style post provided. The author is a brother who feels annoyed that his sibling hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The key points here are the nature of the teasing, the brother's emotional response now, and the author's feelings of being wronged.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bit of a bully, but claims it was never malicious. He says he never let his brother go to bed upset and that he didn't realize the extent of the hurt caused. The brother, however, is still upset 10 years later, mentioning that he cried and felt embarrassed. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of this.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The author's actions as a child\u2014teasing about interests, which can be hurtful even if not physical\u2014might have had a lasting impact. The brother's emotional response now suggests that the effect was significant. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the impact is real. \n\nHowever, the author's current frustration that it's been 10 years and he's still holding a grudge complicates things. The question is whether the author is at fault for the past teasing or for being angry now. If the teasing was harmful, even unintentionally, the author might be partly responsible. But the brother's refusal to forgive could also be an issue. \n\nThe line between playful teasing and bullying can be blurry. The author mentions he never meant it maliciously, but the brother's experience shows it was harmful. The author's annoyance at the brother not moving on might stem from not recognizing the depth of the hurt caused. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions contributed to the brother's pain, making him partly at fault. However, the brother's inability to let go is also a factor. The question is whether the author is the asshole for his past actions or his current reaction. Since the brother is still affected, the author's past behavior might be the main issue, but his current anger could also play a role. \n\nConsidering the details, the author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a case to be made that the teasing had a lasting negative effect. The brother's emotional response is valid, so the author's actions could be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but the situation is nuanced. However, the user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong, which I need to consider. But based on the brother's justified hurt and the author's past actions, the answer could be A. But the author's current anger is also a factor. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is A because the author's teasing caused lasting harm, even if unintended. So the author is in the wrong. But the brother's holding a grudge is also an issue. But the question is about the author's rightness. Since the author's actions had a significant impact, he's at least partially in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
