In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a brother who was a bit of a bully towards his younger brother, teasing him about anime and other hobbies. Now, years later, the younger brother hasn't forgiven him, and the author is annoyed by that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are that the author was teasing his brother, which the younger brother found hurtful enough to affect him deeply, leading to crying and feeling like a weirdo. The author claims they never meant it maliciously and made sure the brother didn't go to bed upset. But the younger brother is still holding onto the hurt from 10 years ago, even though he's now popular and not shy.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if he's in the wrong for the teasing or for being angry that the brother hasn't moved on. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was teasing, which can be a form of bullying, especially if it targets someone's interests and makes them feel ashamed. Even if it wasn't malicious, the impact is real for the victim. The younger brother was affected for years, crying and feeling embarrassed. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now trying to make amends by giving gifts related to the brother's hobbies. The brother is still holding a grudge, which could be seen as unreasonable. The author feels that it's been 10 years and the teasing wasn't that bad. However, the brother's reaction shows that the emotional impact was significant. The author's anger at the brother not letting go might stem from not fully understanding the lasting damage of his actions.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, even if the author didn't intend harm, causing someone to feel that they need to hide their interests and cry themselves to sleep is serious. The fact that the author continued to tease over years shows a pattern of behavior that wasn't just a one-off incident. The author's current frustration about the brother not moving on might overlook the brother's valid feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the initial bullying, even if unintentional, and for underestimating the long-term effects on his brother.\n"
