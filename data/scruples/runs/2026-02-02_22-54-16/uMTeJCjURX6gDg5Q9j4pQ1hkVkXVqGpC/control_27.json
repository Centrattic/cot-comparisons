In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother still being upset about being teased as a child, even 10 years later. The author says they were a \"bit of a bully\" but claims it wasn't malicious and that they never let their brother go to sleep upset. Now, the brother confronted them about it, saying he felt embarrassed and had a hard time because of the teasing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the child teasing and the current reaction. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to be malicious, the brother was hurt and the effects lasted into his adulthood. The author's defense is that the teasing wasn't that bad and that they never meant to cause harm. But the brother's experience is valid\u2014being teased by a sibling can have a lasting impact, especially if it made him feel like a \"weirdo\" and led to crying. \n\nThen, the author is annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years. They got a thoughtful gift, but the brother still reacted negatively. The author is angry now, thinking the brother is holding a grudge over something minor. The question is whether the author is wrong for their past actions or their current anger.\n\nThe first part: The author did tease their brother about hobbies, which the brother felt was harmful. Even if it was playful, the impact matters. So, the author is in the wrong for being a bully, even if unintentional. The second part: the author is upset now that the brother hasn't let go of that. But the brother's feelings are legitimate, so the author's anger here might be misplaced. The brother did confront them, and the author's reaction is to be angry rather than to apologize. So, the author is in the wrong both for past behavior and for being angry now. \n\nBut wait, the user might be looking for a split answer. However, the options are either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Since the author's actions contributed to the brother's hurt feelings and the current reaction is to be annoyed rather than address the issue, the answer is A. The key is that even if the author didn't intend harm, the effects were real. Holding a grudge is hard, but the author's bullying behavior was the root cause.\n"
