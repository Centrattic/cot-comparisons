In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling about being into anime and video games, which led to the younger brother not forgiving him even after many years. The author is now angry that the younger brother hasn't let it go and is upset about the current conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The older brother (author) used to tease the younger one about his interests, which were anime and games. The author claims it wasn't malicious, and they didn't go to bed upset. However, the younger brother felt embarrassed and cried, leading to a strained relationship. Now, the younger brother is in university, popular, and still holds a grudge, leading to an argument where he accuses the author of making his teenage years miserable.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for being annoyed that the younger brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years, even though they think their teasing wasn't that bad. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider whether their actions (teasing) were harmful and if the current reaction is justified. Even if the teasing wasn't intended to be malicious, the impact on the younger brother was significant\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo, and long-term resentment. The author might not have realized the emotional weight of their actions, but the younger brother's perspective is valid. The fact that the younger brother's feelings were hurt and led to a long-term estrangement suggests that the author did cause harm, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also upset that the younger brother hasn't moved on after so many years. However, holding onto such a grudge for a decade indicates that the younger brother still feels deeply wronged. The author's frustration is understandable, but it's important to acknowledge the younger brother's feelings and take responsibility for the past actions. The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong from the start, regardless of intent. Even if the teasing wasn't meant to hurt, the effect was harmful, making the author at least partly responsible.\n\nThe author's current anger at the younger brother not letting go might be a form of deflection. Instead of addressing the root cause (their past behavior), they're blaming the younger brother for holding a grudge. This could indicate that the author is in denial about their role in the conflict. True accountability would involve apologizing and trying to repair the relationship, not being upset that the younger brother is still hurt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have intended harm, their actions did cause emotional distress, making them at least partially at fault. The younger brother's right to feel hurt and seek forgiveness is valid, but the author's refusal to take responsibility and their anger at the younger brother's feelings suggests they are in the wrong in the current situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
