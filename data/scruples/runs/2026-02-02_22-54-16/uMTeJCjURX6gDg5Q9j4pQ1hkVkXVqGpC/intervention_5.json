In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole because their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him as a child. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the author admits they were a bully, even if not maliciously. They teased their brother about anime, which was a big part of his life. The brother felt embarrassed and cried because of this. Even though the author didn't mean harm, the impact was real. The brother is now an adult and still holding a grudge, which the author is upset about. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's actions as a child had a lasting negative effect, even if unintended. The brother's feelings are valid\u2014he felt humiliated and it affected his self-esteem. The author might not have realized how deeply it hurt him. Now, the author is angry the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the fact that it caused significant distress means the author isn't entirely in the right. They were the one who initiated the teasing, which led to the brother's long-term resentment. The author's anger at the brother's still being upset might be missing the point. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't invalid. \n\nSo while the author might not be a complete asshole, their actions did cause harm. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
