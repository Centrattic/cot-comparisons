In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a brother who was teased as a child by his sibling, especially about his interest in anime. The older brother now feels annoyed because his younger brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The younger brother confessed that the teasing made him cry and feel embarrassed, even though he's now popular in university.\n\nSo, the key points here are the nature of the teasing, the impact it had, and the current reaction of both brothers. The author claims they never meant it maliciously and that they didn't realize how it affected their brother. But the brother clearly felt hurt and it's still affecting their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was in the wrong for the initial teasing. Teasing can be a gray area. If it's light-hearted and mutual, it's one thing, but if it's making someone feel bad, even if unintentionally, it's still harmful. The fact that the younger brother felt he had to hide his interests and cried himself to sleep suggests that the teasing was more than just harmless. The older brother didn't consider the emotional impact at the time, which might be a problem.\n\nThen, there's the current situation. The older brother is upset that the younger hasn't moved on after a decade. He's angry that his brother is still holding a grudge. But the younger brother has valid reasons for his feelings. The older one might be in denial about the severity of his actions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong now for being angry about the lack of forgiveness. The author's anger could stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt caused. If the younger brother's feelings are legitimate, then the older brother's anger might be misplaced. However, the author might not have intended harm, but intent doesn't negate the impact. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: even if the teasing wasn't malicious, it's the effect that matters. The older brother should take accountability for how his actions affected his sibling. The current anger at the lack of forgiveness could be seen as dismissing the other's valid emotions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because the teasing had a lasting negative impact, and their current reaction is not acknowledging that. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But there's nuance here. If the older brother is now defensive and not taking responsibility, that's a problem. If he's genuinely unaware, maybe not. But the fact that he's still annoyed instead of seeking reconciliation suggests he might be in the wrong.\n"
