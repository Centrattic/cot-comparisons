In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that his brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him as a child. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for an analysis of the situation presented. The author (AITA) admits to being a bully as a child and teenager, teasing his brother about his anime interests. He claims he never meant it maliciously and never let his brother go to sleep upset, but the brother still hasn't forgiven him, even after 10 years. Now, the brother confronted him, revealing that the teasing made his teenage years miserable and caused him to cry. The author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about losing their relationship over something he thinks wasn't that bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acknowledges past behavior that could be considered bullying, even if not malicious. The brother's emotional response is significant\u2014teens crying themselves to sleep, feeling embarrassed, leading to long-term effects. The author is now angry because the brother hasn't let go and is upset that his efforts to reconcile (getting a gift) weren't enough.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the situation, even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact on the brother was real and lasting. The author's current anger is directed at the brother for not forgiving him after a decade. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional trauma from bullying can last a long time. The author's frustration might be misplaced because he's not taking full responsibility for the harm caused. Instead, he's focusing on the brother not moving on, which could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who caused the hurt has a duty to make amends, not just expect forgiveness. The brother's decision to hold onto those feelings is his right. The author might be in the wrong for not fully understanding the depth of the hurt and for being angry at the brother's valid emotional response. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions (bullying) contributed to the brother's emotional struggles, so his current anger might be a form of deflection. The brother's need for validation and apology is reasonable. The author's reaction to the confrontation might be more about his own defensiveness than genuine remorse.\n\nTherefore, considering the impact of the actions and the lack of empathy in the author's current response, it seems the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
