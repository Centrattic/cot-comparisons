In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were younger. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bit of a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about his anime hobbies, which the brother found really hurtful. The brother is still holding a grudge, even after 10 years, and lashed out on his birthday. The author is now angry that their brother hasn't moved on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the information given, the author's actions as a child/teen were teasing, which the brother found damaging. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact on the brother was significant. The brother's reaction\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo\u2014shows that the teasing had real emotional consequences. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt at the time, but that doesn't negate the fact that their actions caused pain. \n\nHowever, the author is also upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them after so long. The brother's continued anger and holding a grudge could be seen as part of the issue. The author might be in the wrong for the initial teasing, especially if it's true that it made the brother feel ashamed. But the brother's refusal to let go after a decade might also be problematic. \n\nBut here's the thing: the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's current anger at the brother's refusal to forgive is part of the situation. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer depends on whether the initial teasing was harmful despite not being malicious. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is the impact of the actions, not just the intent. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the fact that the brother was deeply affected over years suggests the author did contribute to the problem. However, the brother's reaction and holding a grudge for so long could be seen as part of the issue. \n\nBut the main question is about the author's actions. The author's teasing led to long-term emotional harm. So even if they didn't intend it, the fact that it caused such lasting damage might make them at least partially responsible. However, the brother's continued anger and not moving past it could also be a factor in the conflict. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were wrong. Since bullying (even light teasing) can have lasting effects, the author could be at fault for not recognizing the harm. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's current frustration at not being forgiven complicates things. \n\nIn AITA, being an asshole is often determined by the impact of the actions, not just intent. So even if the author didn't mean harm, the fact that their actions caused significant and lasting distress might mean they're in the wrong. However, the brother's inability to let go could also be a factor. But the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because their teasing caused real harm, even if unintentionally. The brother's reaction, while perhaps overly long, is a result of the author's actions. So the author's initial behavior was problematic, making them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
