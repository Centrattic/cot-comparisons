In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased about his anime hobbies, leading to a long-standing resentment.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if not malicious. They teased their brother about his interests, which the brother found hurtful. The key points here are the intent vs. the impact. The author didn't mean harm but didn't realize the effect their actions had. The brother felt embarrassed and cried, which shows the teasing had a significant negative impact.\n\nThe author got a gift for the brother's birthday, trying to make amends, but the brother still holds a grudge. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for either the initial teasing or for being annoyed now.\n\nConsidering the brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling like a \"weirdo\"\u2014the teasing wasn't just harmless. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the actions still caused harm. The author's defense is that it was just teasing and not malicious, but the brother's experience shows otherwise. The fact that the brother's feelings were hurt for such a long time suggests the teasing was more hurtful than the author realized.\n\nThe author's anger at the brother not letting go might come from not fully understanding the depth of the hurt. They might be dismissing the brother's valid feelings. So, while the intent wasn't malicious, the action still caused lasting harm, making the author at least partially responsible. However, the situation is complex, and the answer might depend on whether the teasing crossed into bullying territory. Since the brother was affected so much, it's more than just harmless teasing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the initial actions, even if unintended. But the final answer could hinge on whether the teasing was indeed bullying or just playful. The brother's significant distress points to the former.\n"
