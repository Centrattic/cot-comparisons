In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who was teased a lot by his sibling for liking anime and other hobbies. The author didn't think it was malicious but the brother is still upset years later. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits they were a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. They teased the brother about anime and other interests. The brother was affected negatively, even crying himself to sleep, and now, even though they're adults, the brother hasn't forgiven them. The author feels angry that their brother is holding a grudge for so long.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, even if the teasing wasn't intended to be malicious, it's clear that it caused significant emotional harm. Bullying, even in childhood, can have lasting effects. The author might not have realized the impact at the time, but that doesn't excuse the behavior if it's true that the brother suffered from it. Also, the fact that the brother is now an adult and still hasn't forgiven them shows that the effects were long-lasting.\n\nHowever, the author is also frustrated that their brother hasn't moved on. But the brother's reaction is valid given the history. The author's anger at the brother's lingering hurt might be a form of deflection or not taking accountability for their past actions. The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong, regardless of intent. Even unintentional harm can make someone the asshole if they knew or should have known the impact of their actions.\n\nIn Reddit's context, the \"Am I the Asshole\" series often considers intent but also impact. Since the brother's experience was so negative and the author's teasing contributed to that, the author is likely in the wrong. Even if they didn't mean to harm, the outcome was harmful. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
