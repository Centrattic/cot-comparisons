In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author used to tease their brother about anime when they were younger, but they didn't think it was malicious. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them and is still upset, even after 10 years. The author is annoyed that the brother hasn't let it go and is angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were wrong. The author mentions they were a \"bit of a bully\" but insists it wasn't malicious. However, the brother was affected deeply, crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. Even if the teasing wasn't intended to hurt, the impact is what matters here. Childhood teasing can leave lasting emotional scars, especially if it's about something the person is passionate about. The fact that the brother felt he couldn't be himself because of his brother's comments shows that the author's actions had a negative effect, even if unintended.\n\nNext, the author is upset that the issue hasn't been resolved after a decade. The brother brought it up again on his birthday, which the author tried to mend with a gift. But the brother's reaction was intense, indicating unresolved trauma. The author's frustration stems from not understanding why it's still a problem. However, the brother's feelings are valid, and holding onto hurt can be a personal choice. The author's anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness might stem from not taking responsibility for the harm caused.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to hurt, but the impact was significant. The brother's emotional response is legitimate, even if the author didn't realize it at the time. The author might benefit from acknowledging the harm and making a sincere effort to reconcile, rather than feeling angry about the brother's unresolved feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions as a child were hurtful, even if unintended. The current situation shows the brother still feels wronged, so the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the depth of the hurt and for being angry at the brother's continued feelings. However, the brother's choice to hold onto the resentment is also a factor. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer would focus on the author's responsibility for the past actions and their current reaction.\n"
