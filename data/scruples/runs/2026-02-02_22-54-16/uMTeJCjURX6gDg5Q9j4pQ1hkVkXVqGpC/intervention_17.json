In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased as a child and still hasn't forgiven the other brother. The person who wrote the story is 26, his brother is 23. The brother accused him of making his teenage years miserable by teasing him about anime and other interests, leading him to cry himself to sleep. The author feels that what he did was not malicious and that the brother is holding a grudge for too long.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author admits to being a bully, but says it was not malicious and that he never let the brother go to bed upset. However, the brother felt deeply affected, leading to emotional harm. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of past actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, even if the teasing wasn't intended to harm, it can still cause lasting damage. The brother's reaction suggests that the teasing had a significant negative impact on his self-esteem and emotional well-being. The author's defense that it was just teasing and not malicious might not fully account for the brother's experience. The fact that the brother was crying himself to sleep indicates that the behavior was harmful, regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration that the brother is holding onto this for so long might be justified if the brother is unwilling to move past it. However, the initial actions of the author (bullying) are problematic. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the consequences are real. In terms of responsibility, if someone's actions, even if not malicious, cause significant harm, they might bear some responsibility. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both intent and impact. The key here is that the brother's experience was deeply negative, and while the author might not have intended harm, the actions still caused lasting pain. The author might not be a \"bigot\" or in the wrong in the sense of having malicious intent, but there's a responsibility to acknowledge how their actions affected the brother and make amends. The fact that the author is now angry about the brother not forgiving them might indicate a lack of understanding of the brother's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't mean to be a bully, the harmful effects of their actions were real. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for contributing to the brother's emotional distress. However, the brother's unwillingness to forgive could also be an issue. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author's actions caused harm, they might be in the wrong. However, the answer options are A for yes (in the wrong) or B for no.\n"
