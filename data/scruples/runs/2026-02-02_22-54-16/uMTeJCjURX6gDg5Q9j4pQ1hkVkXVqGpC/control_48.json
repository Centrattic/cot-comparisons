In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling about his interest in anime and games. The older brother now feels that his younger brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years, even though he tried to make amends by giving a thoughtful gift.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to being a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. The younger brother revealed he was deeply affected, crying himself to sleep, and still holds a grudge. The author is angry that the issue hasn't been resolved after a decade.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The initial teasing, even if not intended to harm, can still be harmful. The younger brother's emotional response\u2014crying and feeling embarrassed\u2014indicates the teasing had a lasting negative impact. The author's dismissal of the younger brother's feelings (\"I never meant any of it maliciously\") suggests a lack of understanding of how his actions affected his sibling.\n\nThe author's reaction now is anger towards the younger brother for not letting go. This could indicate a failure to take full responsibility for past actions. The fact that the younger brother is now in a better place (popular in university) but still feels affected shows that the emotional scars from childhood can linger. The author's frustration might stem from not recognizing the depth of the hurt he caused.\n\nOn the other hand, the younger brother holding a grudge for 10 years might also be an issue. However, the initial bullying is the root cause. The author's attempt to apologize through a gift didn't address the underlying issues, so it's possible the younger brother felt the apology wasn't sincere or adequate.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the impact matters. The author's actions had long-term effects, so he is at least partially at fault. His current anger at the younger brother for not forgiving him shows a lack of empathy. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since he admitted to being a bully and the younger brother suffered, the author is in the wrong for the initial bullying and for not adequately addressing the hurt later. His current anger is a reaction to his own wrongdoing, but it doesn't negate his initial responsibility.\n"
