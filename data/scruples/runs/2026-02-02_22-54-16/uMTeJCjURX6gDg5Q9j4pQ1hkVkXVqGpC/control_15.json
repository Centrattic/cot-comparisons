In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were a bit of a bully towards their younger brother for liking anime when they were kids. Now, the brother still hasn't forgiven them, and the author is annoyed that it's been 10 years and the brother is still upset. The author is also angry that their brother is \"throwing away their relationship\" over teasing that they didn't think was that bad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admitted to teasing their brother about his hobbies, specifically anime, when they were younger. They call it \"bullying,\" which is a strong term. They say it wasn't malicious and that they never let the brother go to bed upset. But the brother felt so affected that he cried himself to sleep and now, even though they're adults, the brother is still holding a grudge. The author gave a gift related to anime and the brother's reaction was negative, leading to a 30-minute argument where the brother expressed his feelings. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't let it go and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are intent, impact, and the duration of the issue. The author claims the teasing wasn't malicious, but the brother experienced it as hurtful and damaging. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the effect on the brother was significant. The harm lasted into adulthood, which might mean the author's actions had a lasting negative impact. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them, but the brother's reaction could be justified given the emotional trauma he endured. The author's frustration might be misplaced because the issue is about the brother's feelings and healing, not just the past actions. \n\nAlso, the author's current anger at the brother for not letting it go could be a problem. Holding onto a grudge is understandable, but the author's reaction to the brother's unresolved feelings might be part of the problem. The brother's response of calling the author an asshole and a hypocrite suggests that the author's past actions had a real effect, and the author's refusal to acknowledge the severity of that effect might be where they're in the wrong. \n\nThe author might need to consider that even if the teasing was light-hearted, the cumulative effect over time can be harmful, especially to a younger sibling who might feel they can't escape the teasing. The brother's popularity in university doesn't negate the past hurt; it's about how he felt at the time. The author's annoyance with the brother's unresolved feelings and their anger towards the brother for not letting go might be part of the issue. So, the author's actions as a child may have been wrong, and their current reaction could also be contributing to the problem by dismissing the brother's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A, as the author is in the wrong for both the past teasing and their current reaction.\n"
