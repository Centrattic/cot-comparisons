In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. The author, who's 26, was a bit of a bully towards his younger brother (now 23) as a child and young teen. He teased him about his anime hobbies, even though he didn't mean it maliciously. The brother was always the nerdier one, and the author didn't take anime seriously. The author claims he never let the brother go to bed upset and didn't think the teasing affected him that badly. Over time, their relationship grew distant, but the brother remained cold. On the brother's birthday, the author gave him a gift related to anime, which he knows the brother likes. However, after dinner, the brother confronted him, saying the teasing made his teenage years miserable, caused him to cry, and made him feel like a \"weirdo.\" The author is now angry that his brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years and feels like the brother is ruining their relationship over childhood teasing.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole for his actions or for being angry now. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author admitted to teasing his brother, which is a form of bullying, even if it wasn't malicious. The brother is still emotionally affected by it, to the point of crying and feeling embarrassed. The author didn't realize the extent of the harm caused. Even though he didn't intend to hurt, the actions had a lasting negative impact. The brother's reaction is valid because emotional pain from childhood can last into adulthood. The author's frustration that the issue hasn't been resolved after a decade might overlook the brother's healing process. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go could be seen as dismissive of the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mean harm and made amends by giving a thoughtful gift. However, the brother's hurt is real, and the author might not have taken the time to understand the depth of the impact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the original behavior or for being upset about the current situation.\n\nIn many cases, even if the intent isn't malicious, the effect matters. The brother's feelings are valid. The author's current anger could be seen as the new issue, as he's reacting poorly to his brother's hurt feelings. So, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for both the past behavior and the current reaction. But the options are A (yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the main issue is the past behavior. The author's teasing caused lasting harm, which he didn't realize. The brother's reaction is justified. The author's anger at the brother for not moving on could be the second wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the initial bullying had lasting effects, even if unintended, that's a problem. So the answer might be A. However, some might argue that the brother is overreacting. But given that the brother experienced emotional trauma, the answer leans towards A.\n"
