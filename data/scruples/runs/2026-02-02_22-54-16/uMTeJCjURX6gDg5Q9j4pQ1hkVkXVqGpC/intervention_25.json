In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were kids. The user says they didn't mean it maliciously and never made him sleep upset, but the brother still holds a grudge after 10 years. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author admits they were a bit of a bully, even if not maliciously. Teasing a sibling can cross the line into bullying, especially if it's persistent. The brother was a nerd, which sometimes makes kids targets. The key point is that the brother felt humiliated, cried, and felt like a \"weirdo.\" That's serious emotional impact.\n\nThe author thought it was okay because they didn't mean harm and the brother is now more socially accepted. But the brother's reaction shows that the emotional scars are still there. The author is now upset that their brother hasn't let go after a decade. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the teasing wasn't intentional to hurt, the effect is what matters. The brother's feelings of being embarrassed and crying themselves to sleep are valid. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt, but that doesn't negate the harm done. \n\nAlso, the author is now angry at the brother for not moving on. That could be seen as dismissing the brother's valid feelings. Even if the brother's anger seems excessive, the fact that the author caused lasting emotional damage makes them at least partially responsible. \n\nSo, the author did something that hurt their brother, even if unintentionally. They are now frustrated that their brother hasn't forgiven them, but the brother's reaction is a result of that past behavior. The author might not be a \"bad person,\" but their actions had a negative impact. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for the initial bullying and for not taking responsibility or understanding the brother's pain.\n"
