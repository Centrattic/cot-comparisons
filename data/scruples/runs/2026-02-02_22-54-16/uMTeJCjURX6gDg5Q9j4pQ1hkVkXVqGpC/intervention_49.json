In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling about anime and other hobbies. The older brother, the author, is now 26 and feels his 23-year-old brother still hasn't forgiven him for the teasing from their childhood and teens. The younger brother confronted him about it, saying it made his teenage years miserable and he used to cry because of it.\n\nThe author claims he didn't mean it maliciously and that they never ended up fighting or anything. He also tried to give a thoughtful gift, but it seems his brother is still hurt. The author is annoyed that his brother hasn't moved on after 10 years and feels it's not a big deal because the teasing wasn't that bad.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are whether the author's actions were harmful, even if unintended, and if holding onto that anger for a decade is unreasonable. On one hand, the author didn't intend harm, and they were brothers playing around. But the younger brother clearly felt deeply affected, to the point of crying and feeling embarrassed. That's significant. Even if the teasing wasn't physical or extreme, emotional harm can be real and long-lasting. \n\nThe author is now mad that his brother is still upset. But maybe he should consider that the impact of his words back then wasn't just a fleeting moment. Even if he tried to make up for it with a gift, the emotional damage might still linger. The younger brother's feelings are valid here. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt, but that doesn't erase the fact that his actions contributed to it. \n\nSo, in terms of accountability, even if he didn't mean to be a bully, the effect of his teasing was harmful. The older brother's current frustration with his brother holding a grudge might be valid too, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's aware now that his actions caused harm, even if unintentionally, he might need to take responsibility. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author's actions were wrong in the first place. Since the younger brother was clearly hurt and it affected his self-esteem during his formative years, the author might be in the wrong for the teasing. His annoyance at the brother not letting go might be justified if he didn't realize the impact, but the initial behavior is the main issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if unintended, the teasing caused significant harm, and he should take responsibility for that.\n"
