In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who used to tease their younger brother about his interest in anime and video games when they were kids. The brother is still holding a grudge after 10 years, leading to a confrontation where the brother expresses emotional pain, including crying himself to sleep. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them and is angry about losing their relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author admits to being a bully, even if they didn't mean it maliciously. They acknowledge that their teasing affected the brother deeply, even though they didn't realize it at the time. The brother, years later, is still hurt and feels embarrassed for his interests because of the author's actions. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on after a decade.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Bullying, even if not intended to be harmful, can have lasting effects. The fact that the brother was crying and felt like a \"weirdo\" shows that the teasing had a significant negative impact. The author's defense is that they didn't mean it maliciously and that they never meant to cause harm, but the consequences are real and long-term. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go might be missing the point. The brother's feelings are valid, and holding onto past hurt is understandable, especially if the hurt was deep.\n\nThe author's actions as a child were harmful, and even if unintentional, they still caused lasting damage. The brother's reaction, while perhaps taking a long time to address, is a legitimate response to being bullied. The author's frustration with the brother's unresolved anger might be because they don't see the depth of the hurt they caused, or they might be minimizing it. The author's current anger could be seen as dismissing the brother's feelings instead of taking responsibility and working towards reconciliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother could have approached the situation earlier, but it's also possible that he was too hurt to do so. The author's role here is that they were the one who initiated the bullying. Even if they didn't intend harm, the impact was real. The author needs to acknowledge that and take responsibility, rather than being angry that the brother is still hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because their actions caused lasting harm, and their current reaction dismisses their brother's feelings instead of addressing the root issue. Answer A.\n"
