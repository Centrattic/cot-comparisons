In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for past bullying.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author used to tease their younger brother about his interest in anime when they were kids. They admit they were a bit of a bully but didn't think it was malicious. Now, years later, the brother is still upset and hasn't forgiven them. The author is annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on after a decade.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author admits to being a bully, even if not malicious. Bullying, regardless of intent, can have lasting effects. The brother felt embarrassed and cried, which shows it had a real impact.\n\n2. The author is upset that the brother hasn't let go of the past. They think the teasing wasn't that bad and don't understand why the brother is still hurt. \n\n3. The brother's reaction is significant\u2014he was made to feel like a \"weirdo\" and was crying, leading to years of misery. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the effect was harmful.\n\nNow, considering perspectives: The author might feel they're not at fault because they were a child and didn't intend harm. However, the brother's feelings are valid. The author's actions, even if not meant to be cruel, still caused emotional distress. The fact that the brother is still struggling with it 10 years later indicates that the impact was long-term.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They admitted to bullying behavior, which is wrong regardless of their intentions. The fact that they continued teasing over years, even if they didn't see it as malicious, is problematic. Also, their current annoyance at the brother not letting go is a secondary issue, but part of the question is whether they are in the wrong for being angry now.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should take accountability for their past actions. The brother's right to feel hurt and not forgive is valid. The author's frustration might come from not recognizing how their actions affected their sibling. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their past actions were harmful, even if unintended, and their current annoyance undermines the brother's feelings.\n"
