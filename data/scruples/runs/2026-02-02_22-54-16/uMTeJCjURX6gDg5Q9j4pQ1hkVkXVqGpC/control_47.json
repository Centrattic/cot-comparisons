In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is the asshole (AITA). The situation is that the author used to tease their brother about liking anime and other hobbies when they were younger. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them and is still upset, leading the author to feel angry that their brother hasn't let go of the past after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to teasing their brother, calling themselves a bully, but claims it was never malicious and they never let the brother go to sleep upset. However, the brother now says this made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and feelings of embarrassment. The author is frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on after so long and is angry about being called an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did the author do something wrong by teasing their brother as a child? 2) Is the author wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them yet?\n\nStarting with the first point: Teasing can be a gray area. If the author is admitting to being a bully, even if not malicious, the impact on the brother was significant. The brother's reaction\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo, embarrassment\u2014indicates that the teasing had a negative effect, even if the author didn't intend harm. The author's defense is that they didn't mean it maliciously, but the key point is the effect on the brother. So, even if the intent wasn't malicious, if the action led to emotional harm, that could make the author at fault here.\n\nSecond, the author's reaction to the brother's anger. The brother is expressing his hurt feelings after years of being affected. The author is upset that the brother hasn't let go of this. But holding onto past hurt isn't necessarily the brother's fault if the hurt was real. The author's frustration might be valid in wanting the relationship to improve, but the fact that the brother was deeply affected by the teasing is a significant point. The author might be dismissing the brother's valid feelings by thinking the teasing wasn't that bad.\n\nAlso, the brother's current personality (popular in university) isn't an indicator that the past issues weren't real. People can be popular yet still have had past experiences that affected them. The brother's feelings of embarrassment and crying were real then, regardless of his current status.\n\nThe author's defense that they never meant harm doesn't negate the harm caused. The phrase \"intent vs. impact\" comes to mind here. Even if the intent was playful, the impact was harmful. That makes the author responsible for the harm caused.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's not letting go might be seen as holding a grudge, but the author's role in causing that grudge is more significant here. The author is the one who needs to take responsibility for their actions, apologize, and work on mending the relationship. However, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the teasing caused real harm, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for the initial bullying, making them the asshole. Additionally, being annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven them might be a separate issue, but the primary fault lies in the original behavior.\n"
