In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is that the author, as a child and young teen, was a bit of a bully towards their brother by teasing him about his interests in anime and video games. They didn't mean it maliciously and made sure the brother wasn't left upset. Now, years later, the brother still hasn't forgiven them and expressed that the teasing made his teenage years miserable, leading to him crying. The author is upset that their brother hasn't moved on and is angry about the relationship being strained.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author acknowledges their past behavior as bullying but claims it wasn't malicious. However, the brother's experience was significantly negative, leading to emotional distress. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the impact on the brother was real. The key here is the difference between intent and impact. The author might not have meant to cause harm, but the brother's feelings are valid regardless of the author's intent.\n\nThe author is now 26, and the brother is 23. The brother's reaction after 10 years is a big factor. The fact that the brother is still holding a grudge suggests that the emotional wounds are still fresh. The author's frustration at the brother not moving on could be seen as dismissive of those feelings. However, the author is also showing a willingness to reflect and understand the brother's perspective, even if they're angry about the unresolved tension.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions, even if not malicious, caused significant emotional harm, then they might share some responsibility. However, the brother's reaction of holding onto the resentment for so long is also a point to consider. The author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely tried to make amends and the brother is unwilling to forgive. But if the author's past actions were indeed harmful, regardless of intent, they might be in the wrong for contributing to the damage in their relationship.\n\nIt's a bit of a nuance case. The author's behavior as a child and young adult was bullying, even if not malicious. The brother's valid emotional response and the fact that the author is now upset the brother hasn't forgiven them complicates things. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were indeed harmful enough to warrant the brother's continued resentment and if the author has made enough effort to address it. Given that the author tried to give the brother a gift and express care, but the brother still holds a grudge, the author's anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness could be seen as a reaction to the brother's unwillingness to move past it, not their own initial actions. However, the initial teasing as a child, even if not malicious, could still be considered harmful in the context of a sibling relationship where the impact is significant.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if their behavior, though not malicious, was indeed bullying and caused lasting harm. The brother's valid feelings and the fact that the author is now upset at the brother's lack of forgiveness suggests that the author might be in the wrong for the initial actions, even if they didn't mean to. Alternatively, if the brother is being unreasonable in holding onto the grudge, then the author might not be at fault. But the question is about the author's current anger and whether they're in the wrong for that as well. The author's annoyance at the brother not forgiving them could be seen as dismissive of the brother's valid feelings, which would make the author at least partially in the wrong now. So combining both the past actions and the current reaction, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given the complexity, I think the author is in the wrong for their past actions and possibly for their current reaction to the brother's unresolved feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
