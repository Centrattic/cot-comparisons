In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 26, and their younger brother, 23. The author used to tease their brother about his interest in anime when they were younger, calling them a bully. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them, even after 10 years, and lashed out during a recent birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. The author admits to teasing their brother about his hobbies, specifically anime, which the brother was passionate about. The key points from the author are that the teasing wasn't malicious and they never let the brother go to sleep upset. However, the brother claims this led to him crying and feeling like a \"weirdo,\" which affected his teenage years.\n\nThe author is now frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on after a decade and is upset about the brother's reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details: The author's teasing, even if not malicious, could have been harmful. The brother's emotional response\u2014crying and feeling embarrassed\u2014indicates that the teasing had a negative impact. The author might not have realized how their actions affected their sibling, which is common in cases of bullying, especially when it's closer family. The fact that the brother is now popular in university suggests that his self-esteem issues might have been due to the author's actions, which he's only now confronting.\n\nThe author's frustration stems from not seeing the severity of their past actions and feeling the brother is holding onto old issues. However, the brother's emotional reaction and the long-term effects suggest that the author's behavior was indeed hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nThe author is also upset about being angry at the brother for not letting go. It's important to consider that people process and heal at different rates. The brother might need closure or an apology. The author's anger could be a reaction to the confrontation, but that doesn't negate their initial role in causing harm.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should reflect on whether their teasing crossed into bullying, even if they didn't intend it. The brother's admission about crying and feeling embarrassed supports the idea that the author's actions were harmful. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not recognizing the impact of their behavior and for not addressing it sooner. However, the brother's refusal to forgive after so long might be seen as holding onto resentment, but the initial harm is on the author.\n\nGiven the brother's emotional response and the author's acknowledgment of teasing, even if not malicious, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong, despite their current frustration.\n"
