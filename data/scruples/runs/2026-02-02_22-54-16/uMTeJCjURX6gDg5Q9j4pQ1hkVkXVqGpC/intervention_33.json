In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author admits to being a bit of a bully as a child, specifically teasing their brother about anime and video games. They say they didn't mean it maliciously and never let their brother go to bed upset, but now, years later, the brother hasn't forgiven them. The brother even cried himself to sleep and feels embarrassed for liking anime because of the teasing. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years and feels their relationship is being thrown away over something \"not that bad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the bullying. The author says it was teasing, but the brother experienced it as making his teen years miserable. Even if it wasn't intended to be malicious, the impact is real. The fact that the brother cried and felt like a \"weirdo\" suggests that the teasing had a significant negative effect. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. Bullying, even in a family context, can have lasting effects.\n\nNext, the brother's reaction. He's been cold for years and finally confronted the author after 10 years. Is holding a grudge for that long unreasonable? Well, if the harm is real and ongoing, he has a right to feel hurt. The author's frustration about the brother not letting go is understandable, but the brother's feelings are valid. The author might have wanted to move past it, but they need to acknowledge the damage first. \n\nThe author's anger at the brother for being upset now is another point. They're upset that their brother isn't \"over it,\" but maybe they're missing the fact that healing takes time. The brother didn't ask for this, but he's finally sharing his feelings. The author's initial approach with a gift was nice, but the brother's reaction shows unresolved issues. The author might need to take responsibility for their past actions and work on repairing the relationship instead of being angry that the brother is still hurt.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They admitted to being a bully, which had real emotional consequences. Even if unintended, the actions caused harm. Now, they're upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The key here is whether they're taking responsibility. If they're still defensive and angry instead of addressing the harm they caused, they might be in the wrong. The brother isn't the problem for being hurt; the author's failure to recognize and address the lasting impact of their actions is the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
