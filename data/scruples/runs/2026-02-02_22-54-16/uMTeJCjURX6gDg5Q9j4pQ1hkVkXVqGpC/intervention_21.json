In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. They provided two possible answers: A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author admits to being a bully towards their younger brother in childhood and adolescence, specifically teasing him about his interest in anime and video games. They mention that they didn't mean it maliciously and would ensure the brother went to bed happy. However, the brother, now in university, still hasn't forgiven them for this, and during the brother's birthday, after the author gave a gift related to anime, the brother confronted them about it, expressing that the teasing made his teenage years miserable and led to him crying.\n\nThe author is upset that their brother is still holding a grudge after 10 years and feels that the teasing wasn't that bad. They're wondering if they're the asshole for their past actions or for being angry now.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n1. The author teased their brother about his hobbies as a child/teen.\n2. The brother claims this made him cry and feel like a weirdo.\n3. The author didn't realize the impact of their teasing and now is upset the brother hasn't forgiven them.\n4. The brother is now 23 and the author 26, with a history of growing apart and the brother being cold towards them.\n\nI need to assess whether the author was wrong in their past behavior and/or in their current reaction. \n\nAs a child, being a bully\u2014teasing someone about their interests\u2014can be harmful. Even if it's not malicious, kids can be sensitive, and repeated teasing can affect self-esteem. The author's actions contributed to their brother's emotional pain, which is a problem. The brother's reaction is valid if he felt that way, regardless of the author's intent.\n\nThe author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on. But the brother's feelings are legitimate; emotional wounds can last. The author's current frustration might not justify the brother's right to feel hurt. Also, the author giving a gift related to the very thing they teased him about could be a trigger, even if well-intentioned. The brother's outburst after the gift might indicate that the past actions still have a strong negative impact.\n\nSo, the author's past behavior was wrong because they were bullying a sibling, even if they didn't mean harm. The current anger might be understandable but doesn't negate their past wrongdoings. The correct answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
