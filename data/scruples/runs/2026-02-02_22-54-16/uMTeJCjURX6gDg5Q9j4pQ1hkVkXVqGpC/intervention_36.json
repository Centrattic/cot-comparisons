In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who's upset because his sibling still hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author admits to being a bit of a bully but says it wasn't malicious and that he never let the brother go to bed upset. Now, the brother is 23 and still holding a grudge, even though the author tried to make amends with a gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was teasing his brother about his interests, specifically anime, which the brother was into. Even if it wasn't meant to be malicious, teasing can still be hurtful, especially if it targets something the person cares about. The brother felt that his years as a teenager were miserable and that he cried himself to sleep because he felt like a \"weirdo.\" That's pretty serious emotional damage, even if the author didn't intend it.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author says he never meant to be malicious, but the impact on his brother was significant. The brother's feelings of embarrassment and being made to feel like a weirdo led to lasting resentment. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm, but the fact remains that his actions contributed to his brother's emotional pain.\n\nAlso, the author is now angry that his brother hasn't let it go after 10 years. However, emotional wounds from childhood can take a long time to heal. The brother's reaction, while intense, might be a reflection of the deep hurt he experienced. The author's frustration could stem from not understanding why the brother hasn't moved on, but that doesn't necessarily make the brother's feelings invalid.\n\nAnother angle is that the author tried to apologize with a gift, but the brother's reaction showed that the issue wasn't just about the teasing but the ongoing feelings of being judged. The author's attempt to reconcile might have been well-meaning, but it didn't address the deeper emotional issues. The brother might feel that the author isn't taking his pain seriously, leading to his outburst.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even without malicious intent, the act of teasing about someone's interests in a way that made them feel ashamed and led to years of misery could be considered harmful. The author's current anger might be misplaced because he's not taking responsibility for the impact of his actions, even if they were unintentional. The brother's right to feel hurt and need time to heal is valid, so the author's frustration in this situation might be the more problematic part.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, not necessarily for the teasing (since it wasn't malicious), but for not recognizing the harm caused and for being angry at his brother for still being upset. The key is that the impact of his actions matters more than his intent in this case.\n"
