In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who used to tease his younger sibling about their anime hobby and now feels the younger brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years. The younger brother confronted him, saying the teasing made his teenage years miserable, causing him to cry and feel embarrassed. The older brother is upset that the issue hasn't been resolved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the older brother did something wrong. He admitted to teasing his brother, even if he didn't mean it maliciously. Teasing can still be harmful, especially if it makes someone feel ashamed of their interests. The younger brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo\u2014suggests that the teasing had a significant negative impact. Even if the older brother didn't intend harm, the effect was real.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The older brother didn't mean to hurt, but the impact was damaging. In such cases, the responsibility isn't just about the initial action but also about addressing the harm once it's brought to their attention. The older brother's reaction after being confronted\u2014he got angry about the lack of forgiveness\u2014might indicate a lack of empathy. He's more upset about the ongoing tension than about the brother's feelings.\n\nIs the older brother in the wrong? Yes, because even if unintended, his actions caused real harm. He should take responsibility and make amends, not be angry about the consequences. The answer would be A. But wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering both the past actions and his current anger. The question is a bit complex because the user is also angry at his brother's lack of forgiveness. However, the main issue is whether the initial teasing was wrong. Since it was, the answer is A. The older brother is in the wrong for the initial actions, and his reaction to the confrontation doesn't negate that.\n"
