In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author admits to being a bit of a bully as a child, teasing their brother about his anime interests. They claim they didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to bed upset, but the brother still hasn't forgiven them after 10 years. The brother even cried himself to sleep because of the teasing, feeling embarrassed. Now, the author is upset that their brother hasn't moved on and is angry about the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong for their past actions. The author was teasing their brother, which is a form of bullying, even if it wasn't malicious. Even if done in a sibling rivalry context, repeated teasing that causes emotional harm can be harmful. The brother was crying and felt like a \"weirdo,\" which shows it had a significant impact. So maybe the author did do something wrong, even if they didn't realize it at the time.\n\nThen, the author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past. The user is wondering if being angry about the brother not moving on makes them the asshole. The brother's emotional response is valid because he was affected for years. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt caused. However, holding a grudge for 10 years is also a choice, but the brother might have valid reasons to still be upset.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author do something wrong initially? Yes, the teasing caused emotional harm. Is the author in the wrong for being upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them? Possibly, because the brother's feelings are valid, and the author might not have fully recognized the impact. However, the brother's refusal to forgive could also be seen as holding onto past pain unnecessarily. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial bullying, even if not malicious, still caused harm. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if the author's current anger is misplaced, but the initial actions were wrong. The user's own answer is B, but I need to assess based on the situation. The author might not be a malicious person, but their actions did hurt their brother. The brother's reaction is a result of that. So the author is at least partially in the wrong for the past actions, even if they didn't intend harm.\n"
