In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing their younger brother about his anime interests as a child and young teen, even though they claim it wasn't malicious and they never left him upset. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them, and the author is annoyed because the brother still holds a grudge, especially since he gave him a related gift for his birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits to being a bully in their younger years, which is a problem. Bullying, even if done without malice, can have lasting effects. The brother was a nerd, and the author teased him about his hobbies, particularly anime. The brother now says this made his teenage years miserable and he cried himself to sleep, feeling embarrassed. The brother is 23, and it's been about 10 years since the teasing. The author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on and is angry now.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they didn't mean any harm, they never let the brother leave upset, and they think the brother is being unreasonable. But the brother's perspective is that the teasing caused significant emotional pain, leading to self-doubt and embarrassment. Even if the author didn't intend it, the impact on the brother was real and long-lasting. \n\nIn situations like this, even if the actions weren't malicious, the fact that they caused harm is important. The author's insistence that it wasn't that bad might downplay the brother's feelings. Also, the brother's reaction of lashing out for 30 minutes and not being able to forgive suggests deep-seated hurt. The author's anger at the brother for not letting it go could be seen as not taking responsibility for the past actions, even if unintentional. \n\nThe brother's statement that the author made him feel like a \"weirdo\" and that he cried himself to sleep indicates that the teasing was not just harmless fun but damaging. The author's response, claiming that the brother isn't actually a shy person now, might not address the past trauma. Popularity in university doesn't negate the emotional impact from earlier. \n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to be a bully, the effects were real. The fact that the author is still annoyed at the brother's lack of forgiveness might be the part they're in the wrong for now. They could be seen as not fully acknowledging the harm done, or expecting the brother to move on without addressing the past. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the impact of actions, not just intent. So the author's teasing likely contributed to the brother's feelings, even if unintentional. The current annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings might make the author the asshole now. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes), because the author's actions, while not malicious, caused lasting harm, and their current reaction is dismissive of the brother's feelings. They should take responsibility and work on reconciliation rather than being angry at the brother for not forgiving them.\n"
