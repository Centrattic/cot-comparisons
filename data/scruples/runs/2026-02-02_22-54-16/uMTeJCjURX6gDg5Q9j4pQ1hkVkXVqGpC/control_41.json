In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The key points here are about past bullying behavior and the current conflict.\n\nFirst, the author admits to teasing their brother about anime and other hobbies as a child. They mention it wasn't malicious but that they used to tease him a lot. The brother now expresses that this affected him deeply, causing him to cry and feel embarrassed. The author is now upset because the brother hasn't forgiven them even after a decade.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. The answer depends on a few factors. Bullying, even if not intended maliciously, can have lasting effects. The author acknowledges their past behavior but didn't realize the extent of the hurt it caused. However, the brother's emotional response is valid\u2014feeling embarrassed and affected to the point of crying indicates that the teasing was more harmful than the author realized.\n\nThe author's reaction now is anger at the brother for not letting go of the past. But holding onto hurt feelings for a decade might seem long, but if the author never sought forgiveness or made an effort to understand the impact of their actions, the brother's unresolved anger is justified. The author's frustration at being called an asshole and the brother's continued coldness might make them feel wronged, but the root issue is their past behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, it's the author's duty to recognize the harm caused and take steps to make amends. The fact that the brother still feels this way suggests that the author's actions had a significant negative impact. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't fully consider the effects of their actions and are now upset that the brother hasn't moved on, rather than taking responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes) because the author's past behavior contributed to the brother's hurt, and their current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings doesn't negate their role in causing the issue. The author's actions had negative consequences, even if unintended, and they need to take responsibility rather than being angry at the brother for being hurt.\n"
