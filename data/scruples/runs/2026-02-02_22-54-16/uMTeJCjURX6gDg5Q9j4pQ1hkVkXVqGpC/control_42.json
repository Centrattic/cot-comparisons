In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking whether they're the asshole for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for being a bully as a child, and also for being angry that the brother is still holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, the author used to tease their brother about his anime hobbies when they were younger. They admit to being a bully, though they claim it wasn't malicious and they never let the brother go to bed upset. However, the brother later reveals that the teasing made his teenage years miserable, and he used to cry himself to sleep feeling like a weirdo. The author is now upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them after 10 years and is angry about it.\n\nThe key points here are: did the author do something wrong initially, and is their current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings justified?\n\nStarting with the initial behavior: bullying, even if not malicious, can have lasting effects. Teasing about someone's interests, especially if it makes them feel ashamed or embarrassed, can be hurtful. The author might not have intended harm, but the impact was significant. The brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo\u2014indicates that the teasing wasn't just harmless fun. Even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, the actions still contributed to the brother's distress. So, in that sense, the author was in the wrong for their past behavior.\n\nNow, the author's current reaction: they're angry because their brother hasn't let go of the past. The brother is in his early 20s, and the events happened over a decade ago. The author is frustrated that their brother is still holding a grudge and is upset about losing their relationship. But does this frustration make the author the asshole? Well, the brother has a right to feel hurt and to need time to process those feelings. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be dismissing the real impact of their past actions. The brother's decision to not forgive could be a reflection of the depth of the hurt he experienced, which the author might not fully recognize. The author's frustration is valid, but dismissing the brother's feelings as irrational could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be at fault for feeling angry, but they are responsible for their past actions and the current dynamic stems from that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author was wrong to bully their brother, which caused lasting harm. The current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might not make the author an asshole, but the initial bullying does. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they did engage in harmful behavior, even if unintentional, that's where the fault lies. Their current anger, while maybe understandable, doesn't erase their past mistakes.\n"
