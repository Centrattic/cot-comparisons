In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother who was teased about his love for anime as a child and now the older brother is upset that the younger one hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the key points: The older brother (the author) was teasing his younger brother about anime and video games, which the younger brother was passionate about. The older one didn't consider it malicious but admitted to being a bully. Now, the younger brother is still hurt and confronts the older one, leading to the older brother feeling angry that the issue hasn't been resolved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nLooking at the author's actions: He teased his brother's interests, which is a form of bullying, even if not physically harmful. Emotional bullying can have lasting effects. The author didn't realize the impact of his actions until the younger brother confronted him. The author's response after being confronted is anger at the younger brother for not letting it go, which might suggest a lack of empathy.\n\nThe younger brother's perspective is that he felt embarrassed and cried over his interests, which the older brother now dismisses as \"ridiculous.\" The author's frustration that the younger brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years could be seen as invalidating the younger brother's feelings. The author's anger at the situation might stem from not taking responsibility for his past actions and instead being upset that the younger brother isn't over it.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, causing someone emotional harm over a long period (the younger brother felt miserable for years) makes the older brother at least partially responsible. The author's reaction of anger instead of empathy when confronted shows a lack of accountability. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the author genuinely didn't intend harm and hasn't continued the behavior, maybe there's room to consider mitigating factors. But the fact that the younger brother's feelings were overlooked and the author is now angry that the issue hasn't been resolved points towards the author being in the wrong. The key is that the author's actions had a lasting negative impact, and his reaction now is not taking responsibility but rather resentment towards the younger brother for still being hurt.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he contributed to his brother's emotional distress and is now upset that the younger brother hasn't moved on, rather than taking responsibility and working to reconcile.\n"
