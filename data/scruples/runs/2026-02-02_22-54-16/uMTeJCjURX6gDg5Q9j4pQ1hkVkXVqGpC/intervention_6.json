In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being teased by their older brother for liking anime and other hobbies. The key points are that the author admits to being a bit of a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious and they never let the brother sleep upset. Now, years later, the brother is still upset and confronts the author about it, leading the author to feel angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. Bullying can be a gray area, but the author acknowledges their behavior. However, they mention it was teasing about hobbies and not malicious. The brother's reaction is significant\u2014crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact on the brother was real and lasting. The brother's emotional distress is a factor here.\n\nThe author's current frustration is about being angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past after a decade. The author is upset that the brother is holding a grudge and affecting their relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't intended to hurt, the fact that it caused significant emotional harm means the author has some responsibility. However, the brother's reaction is also important. Holding a grudge for 10 years might be seen as excessive, but the author's actions did contribute to that.\n\nThe key here is the author's perspective versus the brother's. The author might not see their actions as harmful, but the brother's experience shows they were. The author's anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness could be seen as missing the point of the brother's pain. Even if the author acted without malice, the impact is what matters. So, the author's actions did cause lasting harm, making them at least partially responsible. However, the brother's refusal to forgive could be his own issue, but the author's role in causing the initial problem is undeniable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the brother's choice to hold a grudge might be problematic, the author's actions were the root cause. Therefore, the answer is more nuanced. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards A (Yes) because their teasing caused lasting harm, even if unintended. However, if the answer is B, it's because the brother's reaction is unreasonable. But I think the primary wrongdoing is the author's, even if unintentional. So the answer is A.\n"
