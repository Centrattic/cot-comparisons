In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author, who admits to being a bully towards his younger brother by teasing him about anime and other hobbies. Now, as adults, the brother still hasn't forgiven him and had an outburst on his birthday. The author is upset that his brother hasn't let it go after 10 years, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author acknowledges that he was a bully, even if it wasn't malicious. Bullying is generally considered harmful, even if the intent wasn't malicious. The brother was affected deeply, crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. That's significant emotional impact. The author might not have realized the extent of the harm, but the effect is real.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated that after all these years, the brother hasn't forgiven him. He also points out that both he and his brother are into video games now, and anime is more accepted. He gave a thoughtful gift, which the brother appreciated but still had an emotional reaction to. The brother is now 23 and the author 26, so they're adults. The brother's outburst might be about unresolved trauma or feelings of not being supported, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the impact was negative. Bullying behavior, even in childhood, can leave lasting scars. The author's frustration is valid, but the brother's feelings are also valid. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he admits to the behavior and it had a harmful effect, he might be in the wrong for the initial actions. The anger he feels at his brother not letting go might be a separate issue. The brother's unresolved anger is part of his healing process, and the author might need to take responsibility for his actions, even if he didn't intend harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because his actions caused lasting harm, regardless of intent. But some might argue he's not in the wrong because he didn't mean to hurt. However, the impact is what matters here. Therefore, A makes sense.\n"
