In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between two brothers where the older one used to tease the younger about his anime interests when they were kids. The younger brother hasn't forgiven him, even after 10 years, and confronted him on his birthday. The author is now angry that his brother hasn't let it go and is upset about the brother's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong in his actions as a child. The author says he was a bit of a bully but never meant it maliciously and didn't let the brother go to sleep upset. However, the younger brother claims he cried himself to sleep and felt embarrassed. The key here is the impact of the teasing. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effects were significant. Bullying isn't just about intent but also the effect on the victim. So maybe the author was wrong in the teasing, even if not malicious.\n\nThen, the author is now angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional impact lasted a long time. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing how serious the bullying was and for being upset that the brother is still hurt. The author's frustration that the brother hasn't moved on could be a sign of not taking responsibility for the past actions.\n\nAlso, when the brother confronted him, the author got defensive and angry instead of empathizing. That reaction might make him an asshole because he's more focused on his own feelings of being wronged than understanding his brother's pain. The question is whether the author's actions (past and present) make him the asshole.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his past behavior, even if unintended, caused lasting harm, and his current reaction is dismissive of his brother's feelings.\n"
