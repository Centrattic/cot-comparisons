In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in this situation. So the author is upset that their older brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author says they didn't mean it maliciously and that they never let the brother go to bed upset. But now, the brother is still hurt, even years later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author admits to being a bully, even if it was unintentional. Teasing someone about their interests, especially if it's something they care about, can be really hurtful. The brother felt it made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and embarrassment. Even if the author didn't mean to be cruel, the impact is still real. The brother's feelings are valid here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years, and they're angry that their relationship is suffering because of past actions. The author gave a thoughtful gift, which the brother appreciated but still had an emotional reaction to. The author might feel they've made amends by showing acceptance now, but the brother needed more time or a different form of reconciliation.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was not malicious, but the impact caused significant emotional harm. The brother's inability to forgive might be seen as holding onto past pain, but it's also his right to feel that way. The author is now angry about the lingering resentment, but that doesn't negate the brother's experience. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who caused the hurt has a duty to acknowledge the impact and work towards making amends. The author might need to take responsibility for the bullying, regardless of intent, and seek to rebuild trust. The brother's reaction is valid because the hurt was real. The author's current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be misplaced, as it's not about the brother being in the wrong for feeling hurt but about the author needing to address their past actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions as a child had a negative impact, and even if unintended, they're responsible for that. The fact that they're still being confronted about it shows that the brother needed a different approach. The author could be in the wrong for not realizing the depth of the harm and not making proper amends earlier. Also, being angry at the brother for still feeling hurt might indicate a lack of empathy. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their past actions caused harm, and their current reaction of anger is not appropriate given the brother's valid feelings.\n"
