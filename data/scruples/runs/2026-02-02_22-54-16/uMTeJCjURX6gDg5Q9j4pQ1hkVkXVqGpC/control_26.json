In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for bullying them as a child. So, the author used to tease their brother about his anime hobbies when they were younger, but claims they didn't do it maliciously and never let him go to sleep upset. However, the brother later reveals that he was crying and felt embarrassed because of the teasing, even though he's now popular in university. The brother still hasn't forgiven the author after 10 years, leading the author to be angry.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is that their teasing wasn't malicious and they didn't realize the impact. They also mention they stopped when the brother was upset. But the brother's perspective is that it made his teenage years miserable, causing emotional distress. The key points here are intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect on the brother was significant. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional impact is real, regardless of intent. \n\nNext, the author is now angry that their brother hasn't let it go. The author might think that since it's been 10 years and the brother is now an adult, moving past it is expected. However, holding onto past hurt, especially emotional abuse, can take a long time. The brother's feelings are legitimate, even if the author believes the teasing wasn't that bad. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the brother's feelings or not taking responsibility for the harm caused, even if unintentionally.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility to seek forgiveness. The author got the brother a gift, which shows some effort, but maybe not enough to address the underlying issues. The brother's outburst indicates that the author hasn't taken the time to truly apologize and make amends beyond a surface level. The author's anger at the brother for not forgiving them might be a reaction to not wanting to take full responsibility or to confront their own role in causing pain.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions as a child (bullying, even if teasing) were harmful. The fact that the brother felt embarrassed and cried shows that it was more than just fun teasing. The author's current anger at the brother not forgiving them could be seen as dismissive of the brother's valid feelings. The author might need to acknowledge that their actions had a lasting negative effect, regardless of intent, and take more steps to repair the relationship instead of being annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions contributed to the brother's emotional pain, even if unintended. The author's current frustration is misplaced because they need to focus on understanding and addressing the brother's feelings rather than being upset that the hurt is still there. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not fully taking responsibility and for being angry instead of empathetic.\n"
