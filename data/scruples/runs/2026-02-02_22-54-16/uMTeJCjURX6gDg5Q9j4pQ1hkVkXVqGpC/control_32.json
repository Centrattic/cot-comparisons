In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Ask Me Anything situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author teasing their brother about anime and video games when they were younger, which the brother is still upset about years later. The author is now annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them and is angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong in their actions as a child. The author mentions they were a bit of a bully, using teasing about their brother's hobbies. Even though they claim it wasn't malicious and they never let the brother go to bed upset, the brother clearly felt hurt and it had long-term effects. Bullying isn't just about physical harm; emotional teasing can be damaging too, especially if it affects someone's self-esteem. The brother's emotional distress, like crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed, indicates that the teasing was harmful, even if the author didn't intend it to be.\n\nNext, the current situation: the brother confronts the author about the past, leading the author to feel angry that the brother hasn't moved on. The author is annoyed that the brother still holds a grudge after a decade. But here's the thing\u2014just because the author didn't mean to hurt their brother doesn't negate the brother's feelings. The author's actions had a lasting negative impact, so the brother's need to address it is valid. The author's reaction of being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them might stem from a place of defensiveness, not taking full responsibility for their past behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the brother's feelings is key here. When the brother expresses how he felt, the author's reaction was to get angry rather than to listen and empathize. This suggests that the author hasn't fully acknowledged the depth of the harm caused. Even if the author believes the teasing wasn't that bad, the brother's experience is real and valid. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings could be seen as dismissive of the brother's emotional journey.\n\nAnother point is that the author sent the brother a gift related to anime, which the brother appreciated but seemed conflicted. The brother's mixed reaction might indicate that while he's grateful for the gesture, the underlying hurt hasn't healed. The author might not realize that their past actions have created a rift that requires more than just a gift to mend. It requires genuine effort to understand and apologize for the past behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was the one who engaged in the bullying. Even if it was unintentional, the impact is what matters. The brother's right to feel hurt and to need time to heal is important. The author's frustration at the brother not letting go could be seen as prioritizing their own feelings over the brother's need for reconciliation. The author might need to take responsibility, offer a sincere apology, and work on rebuilding trust rather than being angry that the brother is still upset.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have intended harm, their actions did cause significant emotional distress to their brother. The author is in the wrong for not recognizing the impact of their past behavior and for reacting with anger instead of empathy. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
