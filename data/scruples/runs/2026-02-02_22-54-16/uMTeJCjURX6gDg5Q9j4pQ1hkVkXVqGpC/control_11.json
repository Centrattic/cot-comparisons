In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who was teased by his sibling about being into anime when they were younger. The author admits to being a bit of a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven him and it's causing tension even after a decade.\n\nFirst, the author says he teased his brother about his hobbies, specifically anime, but never meant it maliciously. However, the brother was hurt deeply, to the point of crying himself to sleep. The author seems surprised that the hurt lasted so long and is upset that the brother hasn't moved on. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt his brother, but the brother was affected in a significant way. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the fact that it caused emotional harm is important. The brother's reaction shows that the teasing had a lasting negative impact, leading to feelings of embarrassment and loneliness during his teenage years.\n\nThe author is now angry that the brother hasn't let go of the past. But holding onto such hurt for 10 years can be a sign of deep unresolved issues. However, the author's initial actions, even if not meant to be cruel, were harmful. The brother's experience of being teased to the point of crying suggests that the author's behavior was more than just harmless teasing. \n\nMoreover, the author's frustration at the brother's lack of forgiveness might stem from not fully recognizing the severity of the impact his actions had. It's possible that the author didn't realize how much the teasing affected his brother, but after the brother opened up, the author's anger seems misplaced. The brother's emotional response is valid, and the author's reaction to that (being angry at the brother for not letting go) might be the real issue here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who caused the harm (even unintentionally) has a duty to acknowledge it and make amends. The author's annoyance at the brother's unresolved feelings suggests a lack of empathy for the brother's experience. The brother's actions (calling the author a hypocrite and asshole) are a reaction to years of hurt, which the author might not have properly addressed until now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's initial bullying behavior, even if not malicious, was wrong because it hurt his sibling. His frustration at the brother's continued hurt shows a lack of understanding of the long-term effects of his actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
