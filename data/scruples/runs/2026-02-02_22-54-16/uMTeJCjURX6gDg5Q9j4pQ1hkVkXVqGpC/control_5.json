In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother being annoyed that his sibling still hasn't forgiven him for past teasing.\n\nThe author admits to bullying his brother by teasing him about anime and other hobbies as a child. He claims it wasn't malicious, and he never let the brother go to bed upset. However, the brother is now in his early 20s and still hasn't forgiven him. The key points here are the impact of the teasing over the years and the current reaction.\n\nFirst, even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect on his brother was significant. The brother cried himself to sleep and felt like a \"weirdo,\" which indicates emotional harm. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, still contributed to his brother's emotional distress. The fact that the brother's resentment has lasted over a decade shows that the impact was long-lasting.\n\nNext, the author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on. But the brother's reaction is about years of hurt, so the author's frustration may be misplaced. The author might not fully grasp the depth of the hurt he caused, especially since he wasn't the one experiencing it. The brother's current coldness and outburst are a result of unresolved issues.\n\nAlso, the author sent a thoughtful gift, but the brother's reaction suggests that material gestures might not be enough to mend years of emotional damage. The author's surprise at the brother's lingering anger shows a lack of understanding or empathy for the brother's perspective.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was the one who caused the initial harm by teasing. Even if it was not malicious, the effects were real. The brother's decision to hold a grudge is his choice, but the author is still responsible for his past actions. The author's anger now might be a defense mechanism to avoid taking full responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for his past actions, which caused lasting harm. The brother's reaction, while perhaps extreme, stems from the real pain he experienced. The author needs to acknowledge the impact of his behavior rather than just being annoyed at the lack of forgiveness.\n"
