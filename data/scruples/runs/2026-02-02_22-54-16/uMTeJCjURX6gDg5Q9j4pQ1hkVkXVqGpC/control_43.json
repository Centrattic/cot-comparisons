In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased as a child by his older sibling about his anime hobbies and now, years later, still hasn't forgiven them. The author feels annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on, especially since they were close before and the teasing wasn't malicious.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author admits to being a bully in their youth, even if it wasn't malicious. The brother was a nerd and got teased about anime. The author says they never let the brother go to bed upset, but the brother still carries the hurt. Now, after 10 years, the brother confronts the author on his birthday, expressing that the teasing made his teens miserable, leading to crying and embarrassment. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them and is upset about the ongoing tension.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. So, let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was teasing their brother for being into anime, which might seem harmless but can affect someone deeply, especially if they're sensitive about their interests. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact is real. The brother's emotional response\u2014crying, feeling like a weirdo, and not being able to forgive\u2014shows that the teasing had a significant negative effect. The author's defense is that it wasn't malicious and that they never meant to hurt him. However, intent doesn't always override impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is frustrated because the brother hasn't let go of the issue after a decade. The brother is now in university, is popular, and the author doesn't understand why the brother still feels that way. The author might feel that the brother is overreacting, especially since they were close before and the teasing wasn't physical or extreme. The author is also hurt that their brother doesn't accept their apology or see that they've changed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should take accountability for their actions as a child. Even if it was playful teasing, it contributed to the brother's emotional distress. The fact that the brother is still upset after 10 years shows the lasting impact. The author's anger at the brother for not letting go might be a reaction to feeling unjustly blamed, but the brother has a right to his feelings. The author's current resentment might be part of the problem, as holding onto anger can strain the relationship further.\n\nThe key elements here are accountability and empathy. The author needs to acknowledge how their actions affected the brother, even if unintended, and work on mending the relationship. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's frustration is understandable, but the focus should be on how to move forward. The author might be in the wrong for not fully understanding the depth of the brother's hurt and for being defensive now. However, the brother's refusal to forgive could also be a factor, but the initial action was the author's.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they engaged in behavior that caused lasting emotional harm, even if unintentionally. However, some might argue that the brother's inability to forgive is his issue. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, the answer hinges on whether their actions were harmful. Given the brother's clear suffering, the author's actions were wrong, even if not malicious.\n"
