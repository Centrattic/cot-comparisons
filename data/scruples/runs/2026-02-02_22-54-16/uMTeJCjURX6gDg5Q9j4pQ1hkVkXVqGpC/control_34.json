In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 26, and his 23-year-old brother. The author admits to being a bully as a child by teasing his brother about his anime hobbies. He says he didn't mean it maliciously and didn't let his brother go to bed upset. However, the brother hasn't forgiven him even after 10 years, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. Bullying, even if not malicious, can have lasting effects. The key points here are the author's intent versus the impact. The author claims he didn't mean to harm, but the brother was deeply affected, crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author now feels annoyed that the brother hasn't moved on, which is the main question here.\n\nThe author's actions as a child might be seen as harmful, even if unintended. The brother's reaction indicates that the emotional impact was significant. The author's current frustration with the brother not letting go of the past might be where the conflict lies. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for his past actions or his current anger.\n\nThe possible answers are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering the brother's valid feelings and the lasting effect, the author's past behavior might be considered harmful, even if not malicious. However, the author is now upset about the brother's unresolved feelings. The key is whether the author's actions were wrong, and if his current anger is misplaced. Since the brother's feelings are real and the author's past actions contributed to that, the author might share some responsibility. However, the brother's inability to forgive could also be a factor. The answer would likely be A, as the author's actions, though not malicious, were hurtful and contributed to the ongoing issue. But the current anger might be a separate issue. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother's suffering was real, the author's past actions, even if not malicious, were wrong, making the answer A.\n"
