In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about his anime interests when they were younger. The author acknowledges they were a bully but thought it wasn't malicious. Now, the brother is upset, and the author is frustrated that it's still an issue after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author used to tease their brother, who was into anime, which is a hobby the author didn't share. They thought the teasing wasn't malicious but admitted it was bullying. The brother now says this caused him emotional harm, leading to tears and feelings of being a \"weirdo.\" The author is angry that the brother hasn't moved on and feels the brother is ruining their sibling relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Bullying, even if not intended as malicious, can have lasting effects. The brother's emotional response indicates that the teasing affected him deeply. The author might not have realized the severity of their actions at the time, but the outcome is clear\u2014his brother suffered. The author's current frustration at the ongoing tension could be a form of victim-blaming, where they feel the brother is holding a grudge unfairly. However, unresolved trauma and hurt from childhood can persist, and the brother's feelings are valid. \n\nThe author's actions as a child, though possibly not malicious, were bullying, which is a form of emotional abuse. The fact that the brother is still upset years later shows the impact. The author's annoyance that the brother hasn't forgiven them might stem from a lack of understanding of how their actions affected him. So, the author's current reaction of being angry at the brother for not moving on could be the real issue here. They might be dismissing the brother's valid emotions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the one who engaged in the bullying behavior. Even if it was in the past, the effects are real. The brother's right to feel hurt isn't invalidated by the passage of time. The author's frustration that the brother hasn't let it go might be inconsiderate of the brother's experience. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not taking responsibility fully and for being upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the bullying behavior had a negative impact, and their current anger at the brother's unresolved feelings is dismissive of legitimate hurt.\n"
