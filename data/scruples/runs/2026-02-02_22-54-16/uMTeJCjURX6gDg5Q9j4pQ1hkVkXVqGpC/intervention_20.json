In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the scenario. The user is asking whether the author (the brother who teased his sibling about anime) is in the wrong. The key points are that he was a bit of a bully as a child but didn't mean it maliciously, and now his brother hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that he teased his brother, even if not with malicious intent. Bullying, even if not overtly cruel, can have lasting emotional effects. The brother's reaction includes crying and feeling embarrassment, which are serious emotional harms. Even if the author didn't realize the impact at the time, the effects were real.\n\nThe brother's coldness and eventual outburst after so many years show that the hurt hasn't healed. The author is now upset that the brother hasn't moved on, but holding onto past hurt is part of the brother's experience. The author's anger at being called an asshole might be valid in feeling attacked, but it doesn't negate the harm caused.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he admitted to bullying behavior, even if not malicious, and that behavior caused significant emotional distress, there's a case that he was in the wrong. However, he hasn't been actively malicious since, and his apology and gift were sincere. The brother's long-held resentment complicates things, but the initial harm still stands.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if unintended, his actions contributed to his brother's pain. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the user initially thought the author is not in the wrong. The key is whether the teasing qualifies as harmful enough. Since it caused lasting emotional damage, even if unintentional, the answer might be A. But if the user is considering that the author didn't have malicious intent and the brother is holding onto it, maybe B. I need to weigh the intent vs. the impact. The impact is significant, so A.\n"
