In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is a brother who admits to teasing his younger brother about his anime interests growing up. He says he didn't mean it maliciously, always made sure the brother wasn't upset to sleep, and they drifted apart after university. The younger brother, now 23, hasn't forgiven him and lashed out on his birthday, saying the teasing made his teen years miserable. The author is angry that his brother still holds a grudge after 10 years and feels their relationship is being thrown away over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author acknowledges his past behavior, which was teasing, not physical bullying. He claims it wasn't malicious and that he never let the brother go to bed upset. However, the younger brother felt deeply affected, even crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed. The author is now upset because the brother hasn't moved on and is angry about it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The definition of \"in the wrong\" here would be if the author's actions were truly harmful and if he's failing to take responsibility. The author admits to the teasing but downplays its impact. He says he didn't realize it affected the brother that much. However, the brother's reaction shows that the teasing had significant emotional effects.\n\nEven if the teasing wasn't physical, emotional harm is still valid. The author's actions, while not malicious in intent, contributed to his brother's emotional distress. The key issue here is the author's reaction to the brother's hurt. The author is angry that the brother hasn't forgiven him, which might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of the lasting impact of his actions. The author's frustration at his brother's unresolved anger could be seen as dismissive of the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author took steps to reconcile by getting a gift related to the brother's interests. But the brother's outburst shows that the wounds are still fresh. The author's anger at being called an asshole and his frustration about the brother not letting go might stem from feeling unfairly blamed, but that doesn't negate the harm caused. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the teasing wasn't that bad, but the brother's experience is that it was deeply hurtful. In such cases, the person who caused the harm (even unintentionally) might need to acknowledge the impact more fully and seek to make amends. The author is in the wrong if he's not taking full responsibility and is instead angry about the consequences. However, if he's open to understanding the brother's pain, maybe there's a middle ground. But based on the text, the author seems more defensive, which might place him in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
