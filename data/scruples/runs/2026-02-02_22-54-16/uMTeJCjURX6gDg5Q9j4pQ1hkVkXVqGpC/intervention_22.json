In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing his older brother about anime and other hobbies when they were younger. The brother still hasn't forgiven him, and the author is upset that after 10 years, the issue is still causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he never meant any harm and didn't let his brother go to bed upset. However, the brother claims the teasing made his teenage years miserable, even to the point of crying. The author now feels angry that his brother hasn't moved on, especially since the brother is now popular and not shy. The author also gave a thoughtful gift, but the brother's reaction suggests lingering resentment.\n\nFrom the brother's perspective, even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the impact was significant. Bullying, even in a sibling relationship, can have long-term effects. The brother's emotional response indicates that the teasing affected his self-esteem and social confidence during critical developmental years. The author might not have realized the depth of the hurt caused, but that doesn't negate the brother's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now frustrated because he believes the issue was minor and shouldn't still be a problem. He gave a gift, which the brother appreciated but still brought up the issue. The author's anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness is part of the question here. The user is divided: they think the author isn't in the wrong but are seeking validation.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here, but morally and emotionally, it's more nuanced. The author's actions as a child, while not malicious, contributed to emotional harm. The brother's holding onto the hurt is understandable given the impact on his self-esteem. The author's current frustration might be justified if he believes the issue is overblown, but he should consider the brother's perspective and the long-term effects of his past behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions had consequences. Even if unintended, the teasing affected his brother's emotional well-being. The brother's right to feel hurt is valid, but the author's role in causing that pain is part of why he might be in the wrong. The key here is recognizing that intent doesn't always align with impact. The author's current anger at the brother's lack of forgiveness might be misplaced if he hasn't fully acknowledged the harm he caused.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's actions contributed to the brother's pain, and his frustration now may not account for the deeper emotional impact. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his teasing had lasting negative effects, even if unintentionally. However, the brother's continued resentment is also a factor. But the question is about the author's wrongness, not the brother's. The author's initial actions and current response both play a role in the situation.\n"
