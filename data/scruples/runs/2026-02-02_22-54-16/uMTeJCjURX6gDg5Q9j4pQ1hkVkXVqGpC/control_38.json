In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who feels the other hasn't forgiven him for past teasing. The author is frustrated because his brother is still upset after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. He teased his brother about anime and other hobbies. The brother, however, says this made his teenage years miserable, leading to crying and feeling embarrassed. Now, the brother confronts him, and the author is annoyed that the issue hasn't been resolved.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, bullying is generally wrong even if it's between siblings. The key factors here are the impact on the brother. The author might not have intended harm, but the brother clearly suffered emotionally. The fact that the brother is holding a grudge for a decade is significant. However, the author's reaction to being confronted is also an issue. He's angry that his brother hasn't moved on, which could indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nThe author's initial behavior (teasing that made his brother cry) is problematic. Even if it wasn't meant to be malicious, the effect was harmful. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional impact is real. The author's frustration at the brother's unresolved feelings might show he's not taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother holding a grudge for 10 years without trying to reconcile might be an issue. But the question is about the author's wrongness. Since he did the bullying and isn't fully acknowledging the harm, he's more likely in the wrong. So the answer is probably A (Yes).\n"
