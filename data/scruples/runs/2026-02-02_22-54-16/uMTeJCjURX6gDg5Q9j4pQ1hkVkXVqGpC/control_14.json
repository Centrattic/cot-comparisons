In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The situation is about the author having teased their brother a lot about his anime hobbies when they were younger. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them even after 10 years, which is making the author angry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they never meant to be malicious and even went as far as giving their brother anime gifts recently. They feel they're being unfairly judged. On the other hand, the brother was deeply affected, crying himself to sleep because he felt embarrassed and like a weirdo. The emotional impact here is significant, even if the author didn't intend it.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author claims they didn't mean harm, but the brother's reaction shows that the teasing had a lasting negative effect. Even if it's been 10 years, the brother's feelings are real and valid. The author is upset that their brother hasn't moved on, but they might need to consider that their past actions caused genuine emotional harm. \n\nAlso, the author is now angry at the brother for not letting go of the issue. That seems counterintuitive. If someone wrongs another, even unintentionally, the expectation is that they should acknowledge the impact and seek reconciliation. The author might be in denial about the severity of their past actions. \n\nThe brother's reaction, while intense, is a result of past hurt. It's not about the hobbies themselves but the emotional trauma from being teased by a sibling. The author's frustration might be because they don't see their actions as harmful, but the brother's experience is different. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author didn't mean to be a bully, their behavior was hurtful. The fact that they gave anime gifts might be seen as an attempt to make amends, but it's not enough if they haven't apologized sincerely. The brother's outburst indicates that he hasn't received an apology or understanding. \n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author didn't intend harm, their actions caused lasting pain. The question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they acknowledge they were a bully as a child, even if not maliciously, the impact is what matters. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their past actions had a significant negative impact on their brother's well-being, and their current anger seems misplaced given the brother's valid feelings.\n"
