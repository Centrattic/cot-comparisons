In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their brother hasn't forgiven them for teasing him about anime when they were younger. The author admits they were a bit of a bully but claims it wasn't malicious. The brother now, years later, is still upset and confrontational.\n\nFirst, the author's actions as a child: bullying through teasing. The definition of bullying can be tricky, but if it's repeated and causes harm, even if not intended, it's still bullying. The brother mentioned crying himself to sleep and feeling embarrassed, which shows emotional harm. The author might not have meant to, but the impact is real.\n\nThen, the author's current reaction: they're angry that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. The key point here is whether the author is wrong for being annoyed that their brother is holding a grudge. The author also gave a thoughtful gift, but the brother's reaction was negative. The author might feel they've tried to reconcile, but the brother hasn't let go of past hurts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for the initial bullying? Possibly. Even if it wasn't malicious, the actions caused lasting emotional damage, which makes the author at least partially responsible. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author should acknowledge that impact.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong now for being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The author is frustrated because they feel the issue isn't that bad and the brother is throwing away the relationship. However, the brother's trauma is real, and the author's current anger might stem from not taking the brother's feelings seriously enough. The author needs to reflect on their past actions and take responsibility, rather than getting angry about the brother's unresolved feelings.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But considering the impact of their past actions and the current reaction, the author might be in the wrong for not fully understanding the depth of the brother's pain and for being annoyed instead of seeking to make amends. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
