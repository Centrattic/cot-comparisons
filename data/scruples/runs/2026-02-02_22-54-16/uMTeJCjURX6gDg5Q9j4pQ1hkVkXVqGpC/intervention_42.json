In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who teased the other for liking anime, and now the older brother is upset that the younger one hasn't forgiven him after 10 years.\n\nFirst, the older brother admits he was a bit of a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. He says he never let his brother go to bed upset and didn't think it affected him that much. But the younger brother reveals that he was crying himself to sleep and felt embarrassed, leading to years of coldness. The older brother is now angry that the younger hasn't moved on after a decade.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The older brother may not have meant harm, but the effect on his sibling was significant. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the fact that it caused emotional distress and a strained relationship over a decade is a problem. The older brother is now upset because he feels the younger is holding onto this and ruining their relationship. However, the younger brother's feelings of being targeted and made to feel like a \"weirdo\" can't be dismissed just because the older brother didn't intend it.\n\nAlso, the older brother acknowledges he was a bully, which implies some level of wrongdoing. Even if the teasing was light-hearted in his mind, it clearly had a lasting negative impact. The fact that the younger brother is now in university, popular, and not shy might suggest that the issue isn't about his current personality but about the past trauma. The older brother's frustration at being called an asshole might be valid in that he feels misunderstood, but the harm caused is real.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author (the older brother) might be in the wrong because the impact of his actions was significant, even if his intent wasn't malicious. The fact that the younger brother still feels hurt 10 years later shows that the teasing had lasting effects. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But wait, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. However, according to the story, the author admitted to being a bully, which is a clear indication of wrongdoing. So even if intentions were good, the actions were harmful. So answer A.\n"
