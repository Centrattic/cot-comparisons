In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's brother still being upset about being teased as a child.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, even if it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about his anime interests. The brother was affected deeply, to the point of crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The author didn't realize the impact until their brother opened up after 10 years. Now, the author is upset that their brother hasn't forgiven them and is angry about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's past actions (bullying through teasing), the brother's emotional response, and the author's current reaction to the unresolved tension. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nBullying, even if not intended to be malicious, can cause lasting harm. The brother's experience of crying and feeling embarrassed shows that the teasing wasn't harmless. The author didn't consider how their actions affected their brother, which is a sign of not being fully in the right. However, the author did try to make amends by giving thoughtful gifts, showing they care now.\n\nBut the author is now angry because their brother hasn't moved on. The brother's feelings are valid, and holding onto hurt from childhood is common in siblings if not addressed. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the depth of the hurt they caused. So, while the brother's reaction is extreme, the author's initial actions were wrong. They should take responsibility and maybe work on reconciling instead of being angry about the lack of forgiveness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because their past actions caused significant harm, and their current anger doesn't account for their brother's valid feelings.\n"
