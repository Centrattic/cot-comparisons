In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother who was teased by his older sibling about anime, and the older sibling is now upset that the younger one hasn't forgiven them after 10 years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the older brother's actions were wrong. The author admits to being a bully, even if not maliciously. They teased their brother about his hobbies, which the younger brother took personally. Even if it was just teasing, if it caused emotional harm and led to years of coldness, that's a problem. The key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt, but the effect was harmful.\n\nThen there's the current conflict. The author is annoyed that the younger brother hasn't forgiven them. The younger brother explains that he was made to feel like a \"weirdo\" and cried himself to sleep, which the author finds hard to believe given his current popularity. However, the author's denial of the severity of their actions could be an issue. They might be minimizing the emotional impact of their teasing, which is part of the problem.\n\nThe author is now angry that their brother hasn't moved on. The question is whether being annoyed at the brother's unresolved anger makes the author the asshole. The author's actions (teasing) caused lasting harm, and their reaction to the brother's anger is dismissive. Even if the teasing wasn't intended to be cruel, the fact that it had such a lasting effect means the author is at least partially responsible. Their frustration at the brother not letting go might be valid, but they should take responsibility for their past actions first.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's initial bullying behavior is a major factor. They might not have intended harm, but they did cause it. Their current reaction of being angry that the brother hasn't forgiven them could be seen as not taking responsibility. The younger brother has every right to feel hurt and need time to heal. The author's annoyance at that might be misplaced because they haven't fully addressed their own role in the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They were responsible for the initial harm and are now frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on, which shows a lack of understanding of the emotional impact they caused.\n"
