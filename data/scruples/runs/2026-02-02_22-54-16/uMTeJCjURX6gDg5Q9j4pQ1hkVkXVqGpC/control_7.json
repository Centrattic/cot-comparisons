In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author, AITA, used to tease their brother about anime when they were younger, even though they claim it wasn't malicious. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven them, leading to tension. The key points here are the author's actions as a child, the brother's lingering feelings, and the author's current anger about the unresolved issue.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bully, albeit not maliciously. Teasing about someone's hobbies can be hurtful, especially if it leads to the person feeling embarrassed or like an outcast. The brother's reaction\u2014crying himself to sleep and feeling like a \"weirdo\"\u2014shows significant emotional impact. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the consequences were real and lasting. The brother's current state of being \"cold\" towards the author for years suggests that the hurt is deep-seated.\n\nThe author's frustration is about the brother not letting go after 10 years. However, it's important to consider that emotional healing takes time. The brother's outburst on his birthday reveals how long he's been carrying this resentment. The author might not realize the true extent of their actions' impact until now. The fact that the brother is now in university, more socially accepted, doesn't negate his past pain. People can feel invalidated even if they're successful now.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're in the wrong for their past actions or for being angry now. The key here is that the initial teasing, even if not malicious, still caused harm. The brother's right to feel wronged isn't negated by the author's intent. So, the author is partly at fault for the bullying behavior. However, the brother's refusal to forgive might also be an issue, but the question focuses on the author's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of answer choice, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they contributed to their brother's pain, even unintentionally, the answer leans towards Yes (A). The author's anger at the brother not letting go might be valid, but their initial role in causing the harm makes them partly responsible. The situation is complex, but the core issue is the author's past actions and the lasting effect they had.\n"
