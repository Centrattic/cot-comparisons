In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author teasing their younger brother about anime when he was a nerd, leading to long-term resentment.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bit of a bully, but claims it wasn't malicious. They teased their brother about his hobbies, specifically anime, and didn't let him go to bed upset. However, the brother still hasn't forgiven them a decade later. The author feels it's over and is annoyed that the brother is still holding onto it, even though the brother expressed feeling embarrassed and cried because of the teasing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions as a child/teen, the brother's emotional response, and the current conflict over forgiveness. The author is defensive now, feeling wronged because they think the teasing wasn't that bad, and they're angry the brother hasn't let it go. The brother, on the other hand, feels deeply hurt and is holding onto past pain.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't intended to harm, the effect on the brother was significant. The author might not have realized the impact, but that doesn't negate the brother's feelings. However, the brother's continued resentment without moving past it could also be an issue. The author's current anger at the brother for not forgiving them might be seen as dismissive of the brother's valid hurt.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The actions taken in the past (bullying, teasing) likely contributed to the brother's emotional distress. Even if it was not malicious, the act of bullying, especially in a sibling relationship, can have lasting effects. The author's failure to recognize the severity of the impact until recently might mean they were unaware, but they should take responsibility for the harm caused. Their current frustration about the lack of forgiveness could be seen as not taking the brother's feelings seriously.\n\nOn the flip side, holding a grudge for a decade is also a problem. The brother's reaction might be disproportionate, but it's his feelings that were hurt. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, still led to lasting emotional damage. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the initial bullying, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The immediate conflict is the author being annoyed that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The brother's valid hurt feelings could mean the author is still in the wrong by not addressing the issue properly or by being defensive. Alternatively, the brother's inability to move on is his issue. But considering the initial actions caused harm, the author's past behavior is a key factor here.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who caused the original pain is often the one at fault, even if the other party is also making things hard. The author's current annoyance might be a reaction to the brother's unresolved feelings, but the root cause is their own past actions. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their past behavior contributed to the brother's hurt, and their current attitude is dismissive of that pain.\n"
