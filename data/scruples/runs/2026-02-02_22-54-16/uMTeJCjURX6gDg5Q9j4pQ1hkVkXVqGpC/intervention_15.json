In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The author was a bit of a bully as a child, teasing their brother about his anime interests. Now, years later, the brother hasn't forgiven them, leading to tension. The author is annoyed that the brother hasn't let it go and is upset about the current conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was in the wrong initially. The author admits to teasing their brother, even if they didn't mean it maliciously. They didn't realize the impact it had. The brother, on the other hand, felt embarrassed and cried, which is a significant emotional effect. So, even if the teasing wasn't meant to hurt, the effect was harmful. That makes the author partially responsible.\n\nNext, the current situation: the brother confronts the author after 10 years. The author is angry that the brother hasn't moved on. But holding a grudge for a decade is also a factor. The brother's reaction is valid because the emotional trauma from childhood can linger. However, the author's response to being angry at the brother for not letting go might also be valid, as they might feel they've made amends or thought it was resolved.\n\nThe key points here are the initial teasing causing emotional harm and the brother's unresolved feelings. The author's actions as a child were wrong, even if unintentionally, so they are at least partly at fault. However, the brother's refusal to forgive after so long and the current conflict might shift some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. They are in the wrong because their past actions caused lasting harm, and their current anger at the brother for not forgiving is also a reaction to their own past mistakes. So the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their initial behavior was harmful, even if not malicious. The brother's response, while valid, doesn't absolve the author's initial wrongdoing.\n"
