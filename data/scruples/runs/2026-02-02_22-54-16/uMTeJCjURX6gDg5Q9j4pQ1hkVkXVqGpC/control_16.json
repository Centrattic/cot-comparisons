In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for bullying him as a child and for being upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author admits to being a bit of a bully, teasing their brother about his hobbies, specifically anime. They mention they didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to bed upset. However, the brother still holds a grudge 10 years later, leading to a confrontation where he reveals he cried himself to sleep and felt embarrassed.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't mean harm, but the brother was clearly hurt. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the effect was negative. The author might not see it as bad because they were just teasing, but the brother's experience was traumatic enough to affect him into adulthood.\n\nNow, the author is angry that the brother hasn't let go after so long. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the brother's reaction is valid; being bullied as a child can leave lasting scars. On the other, the author is frustrated that their brother hasn't moved on. However, the author's actions (teasing) had a real impact, even if unintended. The fact that the brother still feels the need to confront them shows the harm wasn't just a passing phase.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for the initial teasing if there was no malicious intent, but the key here is that the brother suffered. However, the author is now upset that the brother hasn't forgiven them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry about it. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions were wrong, regardless of intent. The author did engage in behavior that harmed their brother, even if unintentionally. The brother's reaction is a valid consequence. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might need to take responsibility for their actions and work on mending the relationship instead of being annoyed at the brother's unresolved feelings. \n\nThe answer here is more likely that the author is not in the wrong for the initial teasing (if no malice), but their current anger might be misplaced. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong overall. Since the brother was affected and the author's actions had a negative impact, there's a case that the author did something wrong, even if unintentional. So the answer might be A, but it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, if the brother is being unreasonable to hold a grudge for 10 years, the author might not be in the wrong. But the brother's valid hurt feelings suggest the author did something wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is A (author is in the wrong) because even if the teasing wasn't malicious, the impact was harmful, and the author's behavior contributed to their brother's pain. The author might need to acknowledge that and work on repairing the relationship instead of being angry about the brother's unresolved feelings.\n"
