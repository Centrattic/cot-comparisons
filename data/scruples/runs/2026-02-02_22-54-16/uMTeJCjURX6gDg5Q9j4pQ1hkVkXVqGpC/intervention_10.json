In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a sibling who used to tease their younger brother about anime and nerdy hobbies, which the brother now claims caused him emotional distress. The brother hasn't forgiven them for years, and the author is upset that the issue is still unresolved a decade later.\n\nFirst, the author admits they teased their brother, even if it wasn't malicious. The key points here are intent versus impact. The author thought their teasing was harmless, but the brother experienced it as bullying, leading to crying and feeling like a \"weirdo.\" The brother's emotional response is significant here. Even if the author didn't mean to harm, the effect was real and lasting. \n\nThe author might argue that they never intended to hurt and that the brother is overreacting. However, the brother's feelings are valid regardless of intent. The fact that the brother was affected so deeply suggests that the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were still harmful. \n\nAlso, the author is frustrated that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years. But it's possible the brother needed more time to process and address the hurt. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings could be seen as dismissive of the brother's trauma. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the teasing wasn't meant to be cruel, the author should consider how their actions impacted their sibling. The fact that the brother still feels this way indicates that the author's behavior had a lasting negative effect. The author might not be a malicious bully, but their lack of awareness or acknowledgment of the harm caused could place them in the wrong. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reaction to the brother's outburst\u2014being angry that the brother hasn't let it go\u2014might come across as insensitive. Instead of recognizing the brother's pain, the author is focused on their own frustration. This could indicate a failure to take responsibility for their past actions. \n\nSo, while the author may not have intended harm, the impact on their brother was significant and long-lasting. The author's current frustration doesn't negate the brother's valid feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the initial teasing and for not adequately addressing the brother's feelings in the present.\n"
