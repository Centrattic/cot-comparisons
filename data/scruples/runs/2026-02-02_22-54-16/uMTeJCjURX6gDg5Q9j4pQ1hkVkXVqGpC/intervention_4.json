In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed that their brother hasn't forgiven them for past teasing. The situation involves childhood bullying through teasing about anime and video games. The author claims they never meant harm and the brother still hasn't forgiven them, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. Teasing a sibling about their interests, even if not malicious, can still be hurtful. The key point is the brother's emotional response\u2014crying himself to sleep and ongoing resentment. The author's defense is that they never intended harm and that they thought the brother was okay with it. However, the brother's experience shows lasting effects, which the author hadn't considered.\n\nNext, the author is upset that the brother hasn't moved on after 10 years, especially since the brother is now popular and confident in his interests. The author gave a thoughtful gift, but the brother reacted negatively. The question is whether the author's current annoyance is justified. The author's frustration stems from feeling that the past issue is being blown out of proportion. But maybe the author should reflect on the impact of their past actions, regardless of intent. Even if the teasing wasn't malicious, it caused real harm. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's annoyance at the lingering resentment might be dismissing the brother's experience. The author could have contributed to the situation by not recognizing the depth of their brother's hurt earlier. So, even if the author didn't mean to harm, the ongoing effect is real. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not addressing the issue sooner and for not fully understanding the brother's perspective. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions had lasting negative effects, and their current annoyance might be misplaced given the brother's valid hurt feelings.\n"
