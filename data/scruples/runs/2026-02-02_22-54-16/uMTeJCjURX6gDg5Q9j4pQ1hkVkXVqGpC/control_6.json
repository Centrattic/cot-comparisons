In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother who was teased a lot by his older sibling about his interests in anime and video games. The older brother, who's 26, is now annoyed that his younger brother, 23, still hasn't forgiven him for that childhood teasing, which happened over 10 years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The key points are that the older brother used to tease his younger sibling a lot, which the younger brother found hurtful to the point of crying. Even though the older brother claims it wasn't malicious and that they didn't let the younger go to bed upset, the impact has lasted years. The younger brother hasn't forgiven him and called him out on his behavior, leading to a confrontation where the older brother is now angry that the younger hasn't moved on.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the older brother here. From what's described, the teasing was ongoing and affected the younger brother's self-esteem. Even if it wasn't meant to be cruel, the effect was there. The fact that the younger brother was crying and felt embarrassed for years suggests that the behavior was harmful. The older brother might not have realized the extent of the harm at the time, but as an adult, he should understand that such behavior can have long-term effects.\n\nThe author is also upset that the younger brother hasn't let go of the issue after 10 years. However, the younger brother has valid reasons for still being hurt. The older brother's frustration might stem from not seeing the lasting impact of his actions. The key here is that even if the teasing was not malicious, the harm was real. The author's current annoyance at the younger brother for not forgiving him might be misplaced because he hasn't fully acknowledged the damage he caused.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions as a child were wrong, and his reaction now of being angry because the younger brother hasn't forgiven him might also be part of the problem. He's not taking full responsibility for the past behavior and is instead focusing on the younger brother's inability to move on. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
