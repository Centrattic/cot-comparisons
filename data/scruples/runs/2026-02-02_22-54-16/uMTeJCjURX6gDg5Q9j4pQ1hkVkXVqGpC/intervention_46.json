In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother. The brother hasn't forgiven him for teasing him about anime as a child, even after 10 years. The author is frustrated because they never meant to be malicious and don't see why the brother is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits to teasing their brother, who was into anime. They say they didn't mean it maliciously and never let him go to bed upset. But the brother felt embarrassed and cried because of it. The author is now angry that the brother hasn't moved on after so long.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, teasing can be a form of bullying, even if not intended. The brother's emotional response is significant\u2014crying and feeling like a weirdo. The author's actions, while maybe not overtly cruel, did have a lasting negative impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the effect is what matters here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset that the brother hasn't let go of the past. But holding onto such feelings for a decade might be seen as the brother's issue. However, the author's responsibility lies in the initial actions. Just because the brother hasn't forgiven them doesn't mean the author is in the right, but maybe the brother is being unreasonable in not moving on.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they admitted to bullying behavior, which caused real harm, even if unintended, that makes them at least partially responsible. The fact that the brother still feels hurt 10 years later shows the impact was significant. So even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, their actions caused lasting emotional damage. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their past actions. However, the brother's refusal to forgive could be his own problem.\n\nWait, but the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But based on the analysis, the author did engage in behavior that hurt their brother, even if unintentionally. So maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that the brother is overreacting. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions, not the brother's reaction. The author's actions caused harm, so they are in the wrong, even if they didn't mean to.\n"
