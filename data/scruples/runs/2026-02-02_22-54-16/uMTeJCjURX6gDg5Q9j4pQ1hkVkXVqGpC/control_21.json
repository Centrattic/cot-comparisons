In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author, who's 26, had a brother who's 23. As kids, the author used to tease the brother about his anime interests, which the brother claims led to him crying and feeling embarrassed. Now, the brother hasn't forgiven the author, and the author is upset that after 10 years, the brother still brings it up and seems to be cutting off their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The author admits to teasing the brother about his hobbies, specifically anime, which the brother found hurtful. Even though the author claims it wasn't malicious and they never let the brother go to bed upset, the brother's experience was that the teasing caused significant emotional pain. The key here is the impact of the teasing on the brother. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the fact that it caused the brother to cry and feel like a \"weirdo\" suggests that the teasing was harmful. Intentions matter, but the consequences are also important in determining if someone was wrong.\n\nNext, the brother's reaction. The author is frustrated that after 10 years, the brother hasn't moved on. However, the brother's feelings are valid because he was a victim of bullying. The author's defense is that the teasing wasn't malicious, but the brother clearly felt it was. The fact that the brother was in university and the author didn't maintain much contact might indicate a breakdown in the relationship, but that's not necessarily the brother's fault. The author might be angry at being confronted now, but the brother's right to express his hurt feelings isn't invalid because it's been a while.\n\nNow, considering the author's current anger. The author is upset that the brother hasn't let go, but holding onto past hurt isn't inherently wrong. The brother's decision to voice his feelings after years could be a necessary step for him to address unresolved issues. The author's frustration is understandable, but it's not a justification if they contributed to the problem.\n\nThe brother's assertion that he cried himself to sleep is a strong indicator that the teasing had a detrimental effect. The author's claim that the brother isn't shy now doesn't negate the past emotional impact. People can overcome past hurt and become confident, but that doesn't erase the pain they experienced.\n\nIn terms of forgiveness, it's a personal choice. The brother isn't obligated to forgive the author, especially if he hasn't been adequately apologized to or if the author hasn't taken sufficient responsibility. The author's actions, even if not malicious, were harmful. The key is whether the author has acknowledged the harm and made amends, which isn't clear here. The author's anger at the brother's unresolved feelings might be misplaced if the author hasn't fully addressed their role in the issue.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended harm, the teasing caused real pain. The brother's feelings are valid, and the author's current anger seems to be more about the brother's unresolved feelings rather than the brother's right to feel hurt. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the lasting impact of their actions and for being defensive now. So, the answer is A.\n"
