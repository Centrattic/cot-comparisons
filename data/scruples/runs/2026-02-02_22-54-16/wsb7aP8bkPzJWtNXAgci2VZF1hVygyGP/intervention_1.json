My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, especially since they're only 18 and dealing with their parents' divorce.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated. That's a big deal. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, including severe depression and obesity, and she's been abusive and angry towards the dad. The affair started around the time she was in the hospital, which adds another layer. The dad ended the affair after she came back and they tried to work things out. But then the mom snoop on his phone, found out, and things escalated into a nasty divorce. She's been using the sheriff's deputies and sending videos to his department, which is pretty extreme. \n\nThe author is being pressured by the mom to take her side, but they're naturally leaning towards the dad because of how the mom is acting. The dad is trying to make peace, while the mom is hostile and manipulative. The author feels torn but can't help but support the dad. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for taking the dad's side? Well, considering the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is the one being abusive and using legal threats unreasonably. The author isn't in a position of power here; they're just a teenager caught in the middle. Choosing a parent who is showing remorse and trying to fix things versus one who is acting out in anger and mental instability doesn't seem like a clear-cut wrong choice. \n\nMaybe the author isn't in the wrong. The dad's fault is past, and the mom's current behavior is problematic. The author is reacting to the situation as it is now. They're also under pressure from the mom, which isn't fair. The key factors are the dad's accountability and the mom's manipulation. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
