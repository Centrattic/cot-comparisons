My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. The situation is pretty complex. The parents are both 35, the author is 18, and the parents had the author when they were teenagers. \n\nThe dad got a PhD and became a professor, which seems like he's working hard. The mom has had mental health issues, including periods of being morbidly obese, angry, and even admitted to a mental institution. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student when she was in the institution. After the mom was released, the dad ended the affair, but the mom found out through his phone and the divorce became contentious.\n\nThe mom is acting out, like calling the police on the dad and sending videos to his workplace. The dad is trying to settle the divorce, offering everything, while the mom is being manipulative, giving the author letters to deliver, and making the author relay negative messages to the dad. The author feels compelled to take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues and is being vindictive. The author is caught in the middle, trying to navigate both parents' behavior. The author isn't ignoring the dad's wrongdoing but is taking his side given the mom's toxic actions. \n\nIs the author at fault? Taking sides in a divorce can be tricky, especially when one parent is abusive or manipulative. Since the author is an adult, their decision to support the dad who is remorseful and the mom who is acting out might be seen as understandable. However, the dad did cheat, which is a major factor. But the context of the mom's mental health and behavior complicates things. The author isn't excusing the dad's cheating but is considering the broader circumstances. \n\nIn these situations, taking a side isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on the behavior and well-being of all involved. The mom's actions are harmful, and the dad is trying to make amends. The author's choice to support the dad might be seen as a way to protect their mental health and avoid further conflict. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
