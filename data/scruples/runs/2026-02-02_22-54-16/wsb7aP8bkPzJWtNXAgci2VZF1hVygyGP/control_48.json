My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, about to graduate high school, and her parents are going through a messy divorce. Her dad cheated on her mom when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad then tried to reconcile, but the mom discovered the affair and the divorce became very hostile. The mom has been acting out, including calling the police on the dad, sending videos to his employer, and giving the author nasty letters to deliver to him. The dad has apologized and wants to resolve things, while the mom seems vindictive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting her dad. The key points here are the dad's infidelity, the mom's mental health issues, and the dynamics of the author's relationship with both parents. \n\nThe dad admitted his mistake and is trying to make amends by offering everything possible to get the divorce finalized. The mom, on the other hand, is using the divorce as a way to exact revenge or emotional pain on the dad, even going as far as involving law enforcement in a deceptive way. The author feels she can't help but take her dad's side given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, taking sides in a parental conflict isn't inherently wrong. However, the dad's cheating is a significant factor. But the author's perspective is that her dad's actions were partly a result of the stress and challenges in their family dynamic, including the mom's behavior. The mom's actions post-divorce are more about causing harm than resolving issues. \n\nThe author hasn't taken any active negative steps against the mom, just aligning with her dad's side emotionally. The mom is the one using the child as a pawn by giving her letters and making demands. So, while the dad did wrong by cheating, the author's support for him isn't necessarily wrong because the mom's behavior is more destructive. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's support is understandable given the context. The dad acknowledged his mistake and is trying to fix things, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative. The author isn't causing harm but is reacting to the situation. It's a complex case, but not in the wrong.\n"
