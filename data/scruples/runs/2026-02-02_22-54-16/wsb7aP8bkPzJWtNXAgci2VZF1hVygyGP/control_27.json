My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad cheated on the mom, but the mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being abusive and having severe depression. The dad, after cheating, tried to reconcile and now the mom is causing a lot of trouble during the divorce, even involving authorities in a harassing way. The daughter is caught in the middle, taking her dad's side because of the mom's behavior, even though he cheated.\n\nThe question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the details, the dad cheated, which is typically seen as a wrongdoing. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic, with mental health issues and abusive actions. The daughter is influenced by the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's attempts to move on. The key here is the daughter's perspective: she's an adult now, graduating high school, and trying to navigate a very complex family situation. \n\nIn cases where one parent is abusive or toxic, it's not uncommon for the other parent to take a stand. However, the dad did cheat first. But the mom's response is equally, if not more, harmful. The daughter is taking her dad's side because he's trying to move past the cheating and get the divorce done, while the mom is acting out. \n\nThe daughter isn't being asked just to take sides, but the mom is forcing her to deliver nasty letters and take her side, which is a form of emotional manipulation. The daughter's choice might be seen as self-preservation or aligning with the parent who is less toxic at this point, despite the initial cheating. \n\nCheating is a major issue, but if the other parent's behavior is equally harmful, the daughter's side could be justified. The question is whether taking the dad's side, despite his cheating, is wrong. Considering the context of the mom's behavior, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she's responding to the mom's worse actions. However, some might argue that the dad's cheating makes her at fault regardless. But given the complexity, the daughter's actions are more about protecting herself from the mom's toxicity. So, the answer would be B.\n"
