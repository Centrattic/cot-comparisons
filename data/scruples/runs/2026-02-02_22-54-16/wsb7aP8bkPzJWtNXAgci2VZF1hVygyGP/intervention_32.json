My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating on the mom. The author's dad cheated, but the mom has been acting out, including institutionalization, mental health issues, and then post-divorce harassment. The dad admitted fault and wants the divorce to be final, while the mom is causing trouble. The author feels conflicted but sides with the dad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The dad cheated, which is a significant wrongdoing. However, the mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression that led to her being hospitalized. After the affair, she was in a mental institution, and when she came out, the dad ended the affair. Then the mom became hostile, involving law enforcement in a manipulative way, and is generally making life difficult for the dad. The author is caught in the middle, with the dad advising respect, but the mom pushing the author to take her side with harsh messages.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the dad's cheating led to the divorce, but the mom's behavior after is even more harmful. The author feels they can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's actions and the dad's remorse. The key question is whether taking the dad's side makes the author an asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The dad cheated, which is a betrayal, but the mom's response is arguably more malicious. The author is an adult now, 18 and graduating high school, which adds to their maturity in handling the situation. The author isn't necessarily supporting the dad's cheating but is recognizing the mom's harmful behavior post-divorce. The dad is taking responsibility by offering to settle things, while the mom is acting out. The author's choice might be seen as pragmatic, prioritizing stability and well-being. \n\nHowever, taking a side in a parental conflict can be complex. But given the mom's manipulative behavior and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake, the author's choice might be justified. The author isn't ignoring the dad's fault but is also seeing the bigger picture of the mom's ongoing harm. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
