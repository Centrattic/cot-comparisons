My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom, which is a major issue. But the mom has a history of mental health problems, including morbid obesity, depression, and acting out badly towards the dad and the author. The mom's behavior escalated when the dad cheated, leading to a very contentious divorce. The dad admitted his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is using the divorce to harass him, making false accusations and involving authorities. The author feels caught in the middle, with the dad asking for respect towards the mom, but the mom forcing the author to take her side and deliver harsh letters.\n\nSo, the author is siding with the dad because they see the mom as abusive and manipulative. The question is whether taking the dad's side makes the author the asshole. \n\nIn many similar cases, people argue that a child shouldn't be forced to take sides in a divorce. But here, the mom is actively pushing the child to take her side and threatening or being abusive towards the dad. The dad is trying to be respectful and wants the divorce to be amicable. The author is reacting to the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's efforts to move forward. \n\nCheating is a serious fault, but the mom's ongoing mental health issues and manipulative actions in the divorce complicate things. The author is in a tough spot, but their choice to support the dad, given the mom's actions, might be understandable. However, taking sides can still be seen as problematic if it's not balanced. But in this case, the mom's behavior is extreme and the dad is trying to make amends. \n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate, and clearly loves both parents but finds the mom's behavior unbearable. The dad's cheating is a mistake, but the mom's actions are more harmful in the present. The author is protecting their own well-being and supporting the parent who is trying to do the right thing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're in a tough situation but are responding to the mom's toxic behavior and the dad's efforts to resolve things amicably.\n"
