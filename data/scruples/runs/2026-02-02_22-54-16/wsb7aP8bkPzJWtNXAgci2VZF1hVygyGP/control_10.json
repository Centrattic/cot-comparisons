My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. The situation is pretty complicated. The parents are both 35, the author is 18, female, about to graduate high school with honors. The parents were teenagers when they had her, stayed together with mixed results. The dad got a PhD and became a professor, which required a lot of effort. The mom had a history of being abusive and having mental health issues, including being admitted to a mental institution. The dad cheated on the mom with a younger grad student when the mom was hospitalized. After the mom recovered, the dad ended the affair but the mom found out through phone snooping. The divorce process is very contentious, with the mom harassing the dad, even involving the police. The dad is trying to settle, while the mom is being difficult, asking the author to deliver harsh messages. The author is torn but sides with the dad because of the mom's behavior. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking the dad's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad cheated, which is clearly wrong. But the mom had a history of being abusive, mental health issues, and is now using the divorce as a way to torment the dad. The author is caught in the middle, being pressured by both sides. The dad acknowledges his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is manipulative and toxic. The author is taking the side of the parent who, despite cheating, is trying to resolve the situation respectfully, while the other parent is actively harmful. \n\nThe key here is that the author is taking the side of the parent who is trying to move past the cheating and is more cooperative, even though the dad did cheat. The mom, on the other hand, is the one engaging in abusive and manipulative behavior. The author's side is influenced by the reality of both parents' behaviors, not just the cheating. So, while the dad did wrong, the mom's actions are worse in the context of the divorce. The author isn't ignoring the dad's mistake but is weighing the overall situation. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author is being unreasonable. The author is responding to both parents' actions and choosing the side that's more respectful and cooperative. The mom's demands to take her side and deliver harmful messages are manipulative. The author is not obligated to take a side, but when they do, it's towards the parent who is trying to be reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to the reality of the situation where the other parent is worse. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
