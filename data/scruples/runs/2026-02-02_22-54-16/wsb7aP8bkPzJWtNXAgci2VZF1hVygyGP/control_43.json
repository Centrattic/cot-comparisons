My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce even though he cheated. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. That's a big deal. But there's a lot of backstory. The parents had the daughter when they were teenagers. The dad worked hard to get his PhD and became a professor. The mom has mental health issues, sometimes being abusive and neglectful. She's been in a mental institution before. The dad's affair happened around the time the mom was in the institution. Then the dad tried to reconcile but the mom snoop on his phone, found out, and the divorce became really messy. The mom is acting out, threatening, and involving authorities in a harmful way. The dad wants to end the marriage but the mom is dragging it out. The daughter is being pressured by both sides. The mom wants the daughter to take her side and deliver mean letters, while the dad asks her to be respectful to the mom.\n\nSo the author is taking her dad's side because she sees the mom's behavior as toxic and abusive. The dad admitted his mistake, but the mom's actions are making the situation worse. The daughter feels she can't help but take her dad's side because of the mom's treatment towards both her and the dad.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the dad cheated, but the mom is mentally ill and has a history of abuse. The daughter is caught in between, and the dad is trying to move on, while the mom is being manipulative. The daughter is taking her dad's side because she sees the mom's actions as more harmful.\n\nIn many cases, when a parent is abusive or has mental health issues, children might take the side of the other parent, especially if that parent is making efforts to make amends. The dad cheated, but the mom's behavior is more destructive. The daughter isn't supporting the cheating; she's acknowledging the dad's mistake but sees the mom as the bigger problem. So, the daughter isn't in the wrong because she's reacting to the mom's harmful behavior, even though the dad did something wrong. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
