My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. So, by typical standards, that's a wrongdoing. But the mom has a history of mental health issues, including severe depression, and she's behaved in ways that are abusive and harmful. The dad ended his affair once he started trying to reconcile with the mom, and when the mom found out, the divorce became contentious. The mom has been acting out, involving authorities, and putting the kid in the middle by making her deliver nasty letters to the dad. \n\nThe author, an 18-year-old daughter, is caught between both parents. The dad is honest with her, acknowledges his mistake, and wants to move on. The mom is emotionally unstable and manipulative, making the daughter feel like she has to take her side. The daughter is taking her dad's side because he admitted fault, tried to make amends, and the mom's behavior is toxic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The key points here are the dad's initial cheating, but also the mom's ongoing abusive behavior. The daughter is not in a position to judge adults in a complex situation. She's being manipulated by the mom into taking her side, which might not be healthy. However, taking her dad's side, even if he cheated, might be because he's being more responsible and honest. \n\nIn many cases, taking a parent's side can be complex. But here, the mom is using the daughter against the dad, which is a form of alienation. The daughter might feel conflicted but has a right to side with the parent who is being more transparent and is trying to resolve things. The dad's cheating is a past mistake, but the mom's ongoing behavior is a current problem. The daughter's choice might not be based on who is \"right\" in the relationship but who is being more supportive and honest. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's navigating a difficult situation where both parents have flaws, but she's choosing the one who is more cooperative and honest, especially when the other parent is being toxic and manipulative.\n"
