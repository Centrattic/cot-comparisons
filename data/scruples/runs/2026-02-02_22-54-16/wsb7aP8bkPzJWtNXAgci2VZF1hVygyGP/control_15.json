My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. That's a big deal. But from the author's perspective, the mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression, becoming morbidly obese, and being abusive towards the dad. After the affair, the mom seems to have escalated things by involving the police in a threatening way, which was really harsh. The dad, on the other hand, admitted his mistake and tried to make amends by offering to settle the divorce in his favor to move on.\n\nThe author is caught in the middle. The dad wants the author to be respectful to the mom, while the mom is pushing the author to take her side and deliver hostile messages. The author feels conflicted but ends up taking the dad's side because of the mom's behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, taking a side in a family conflict can be tricky. The dad cheated, which is a clear wrong action. However, the mom's subsequent actions might have made things worse. The author is an 18-year-old about to graduate high school, so they're still forming their own views. Choosing to support the parent who showed remorse and tried to resolve things might be natural. The mom's behavior seems more vindictive and harmful, especially after the affair. The dad's willingness to let go and move on, despite the costs, might make the author's stance understandable. The key here is that the author isn't taking sides out of loyalty but because of the mom's ongoing toxicity. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's choice is influenced by the mom's harmful actions and the dad's attempts to reconcile and move forward.\n"
