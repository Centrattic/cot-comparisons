My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation fully. The dad is a professor who got a PhD, and the mom has mental health issues, including depression and obesity. The dad had an affair with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. After the mom recovered, the dad broke off the affair. The mom then found out through his phone, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is acting out, involving the police, sending videos to his department, etc. The dad is trying to move on, while the mom is being hostile and manipulative towards the daughter, making her deliver nasty letters.\n\nThe daughter is 18, graduating high school. She knows her dad cheated but feels he's trying to make amends, while her mom is being abusive and manipulative. The dad tells her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom pushes her to take sides. The daughter is taking her dad's side because of his efforts to resolve things, and the mom's behavior is toxic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The key factors here are the dad's infidelity versus the mom's ongoing mental health issues and abusive behavior. The daughter is caught in the middle, and she's choosing the parent who, while having made a mistake, is trying to move forward and is being targeted by the other parent.\n\nIn these situations, it's common for children to side with the parent who is more emotionally stable or less abusive. The dad admitted his mistake and is trying to fix things, while the mom is emotionally abusive and manipulative. The daughter's choice to take her dad's side is understandable, especially since the mom is pressuring her to take her side through toxic means.\n\nHowever, taking sides can be seen as unfair if the other parent is also at fault. But here, the dad's cheating was a one-time mistake during a vulnerable time for the mom, whereas the mom's behavior is ongoing and abusive. The daughter might be justified in supporting the parent who is making amends and is less harmful.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers the intent and ongoing behavior. The dad's mistake was a past action, while the mom's actions are current and damaging. The daughter's choice to support her dad isn't necessarily wrong because she's reacting to the mom's manipulation and the dad's efforts to heal. So, the answer would likely be B (No), she's not the asshole.\n"
