My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital for depression. He later tried to reconcile, but the mom became abusive, involving the police and spreading malicious content. The author is being pressured by the mom to take her side and deliver harsh letters, while the dad is asking the author to be respectful. The author feels the dad's actions were justified due to the mom's behavior and is taking his side.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The dad cheated, which is a serious issue. But the mom's behavior post-divorce is extreme and toxic, creating a hostile environment. The author is caught in the middle, trying to navigate between two problematic parents. The key question is whether the author's support for the dad makes them the asshole, despite his cheating.\n\nSome might argue that taking the dad's side is wrong because he cheated. But others might see it as understandable given the mom's vindictiveness and the dad's attempts to make amends. The author isn't condoning the cheating but is responding to the overall context of the parents' conflict. The mom's actions are arguably more harmful and manipulative, pushing the author towards the dad's side. The author is also a minor, which adds to the complexity of their position.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at intent and context. The author isn't involved in the cheating or the divorce decisions, so their support is more about aligning with the parent who's trying to move on, rather than excusing the infidelity. The mom's behavior seems to be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
