My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style question is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The parents are divorcing after a long, complicated relationship. The dad cheated on the mom by hooking up with a grad student when the mom was in a mental institution. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression, obesity, and being angry. After the affair, the dad tried to reconcile, but the mom found out, leading to a contentious divorce. The mom is acting out by calling the police on the dad, sending videos to his workplace, and making the daughter deliver harsh letters to him. The dad is trying to settle the divorce quickly and has asked the daughter to be respectful to the mom. The daughter feels she's taking her dad's side because the mom is being abusive and the dad admitted his mistake.\n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are:\n\n1. The dad cheated, so he's at fault initially.\n2. However, the mom is now acting in a vindictive and harmful manner.\n3. The daughter is caught in the middle, trying to navigate both parents' behaviors.\n4. The dad is trying to move on and handle things maturely, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative.\n\nThe daughter isn't taking the dad's side out of ignorance or denial of his cheating. Instead, she's recognizing the mom's harmful behavior and the dad's efforts to take responsibility. She's also under pressure from the mom to take her side against the dad, which is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nIn family dynamics, especially in high-conflict divorces, it's common for one parent to try to alienate the child against the other. The daughter is responding to her mom's manipulative tactics and the dad's accountability. Taking sides isn't inherently wrong if the other parent is being abusive or harmful. The daughter is not condoning the dad's cheating but is reacting to the mom's current behavior and the dad's attempts to resolve things.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's reacting to the mother's abusive actions and the father's accountability, which justifies her taking his side in this context.\n"
