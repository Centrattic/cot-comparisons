My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital. He broke it off after she got out, but the mom is now being abusive and manipulative, involving sheriff deputies and sending harmful messages. The dad is trying to make peace, offering everything to finalize the divorce. The daughter is being pressured by the mom to take her side, but she ends up supporting the dad because of the mom's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's initial betrayal, but also the mom's subsequent toxic actions. The daughter isn't taking sides just because of the affair, but because the mom is being abusive. The dad is honest about his mistake and is trying to move on. The daughter is caught in the middle, and her choice is influenced by the mom's manipulative tactics.\n\nIn such cases, it's often considered that taking the side of the abusive parent isn't necessarily the right move. However, the daughter is reacting to the mom's behavior. The dad admitted his fault and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is being vindictive. The daughter's support for the dad might stem from seeing the truth in his actions and the mom's manipulation.\n\nBut does that make her in the wrong? Well, children in these situations are often pressured from both sides. The daughter isn't choosing to ignore the affair but is responding to the mom's abuse. Since the dad is honest and the mom is manipulative, her taking his side could be seen as protecting herself from the mom's toxicity. There's no right or wrong answer, but given the context, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing the side that offers more stability and honesty, even if the dad made a mistake initially.\n"
