My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a divorce between their parents, where the dad cheated, but the mom is also acting out in really negative ways. The author is an 18-year-old who's taking their dad's side, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The dad cheated on the mom by hooking up with a grad student while the mom was in a mental institution. The mom has a history of severe depression, anger issues, and being abusive towards the dad. After the affair, when the mom found out, the divorce became very contentious. The mom is using the kids to send messages and even involved law enforcement in a manipulative way. The dad is trying to move on and is offering to give up everything to get the divorce done.\n\nThe author is being pressured by the mom to take her side, but instead, they're siding with the dad. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. \n\nFrom what's described, the dad admitted his mistake and wants to resolve things, while the mom is the one being abusive, manipulative, and causing unnecessary conflict. The author isn't just taking sides because of the cheating; they're recognizing the ongoing harm the mom is causing. The dad is also encouraging the author to be respectful to the mom, which adds complexity. However, the mom's behavior is clearly toxic.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's common for children to feel torn. But if one parent is being abusive or manipulative, supporting the other side isn't necessarily wrong, especially when the other parent is trying to make peace. The author is an adult now (turning 18), so their judgment might be more mature. They're not just blindly taking a side but acknowledging the dad's fault but also the mom's ongoing issues.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong for taking their dad's side. The dad's cheating is a mistake, but the mom's behavior is worse. The author's choice to side with the dad despite his mistake is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
