My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating. First, I need to look at both sides of the story.\n\nThe dad cheated on the mom and then tried to reconcile, but the mom was really unstable, with mental health issues. She was admitted to an institution and had periods of being abusive and angry. After the affair, the mom seems to be acting out, making false accusations, involving authorities, and trying to get the author to take her side. The dad, on the other hand, admitted his mistake, wants to move on, and is offering everything to finalize the divorce.\n\nThe author is caught in the middle. The mom is pressuring her to take her side, even giving her mean letters to deliver. The dad is asking her to be respectful. The author is frustrated with the mom's behavior and can't help but support the dad. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author's feelings are valid. The mom's actions are harmful and manipulative, and the dad's cheating was a mistake but he's taking responsibility. The author isn't endorsing the affair, but rather siding with the parent who seems to be trying to move forward and be respectful. \n\nIn such situations, it's common for children to feel torn. The author's choice to side with the dad, especially given the mom's toxic behavior, isn't necessarily about justifying the affair but about supporting the parent who's making amends. The question is whether taking the dad's side makes her an asshole. Considering the context, it's more about the mom's ongoing harmful actions versus the dad's attempts to fix things. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for taking her dad's side given the mom's behavior and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake.\n"
