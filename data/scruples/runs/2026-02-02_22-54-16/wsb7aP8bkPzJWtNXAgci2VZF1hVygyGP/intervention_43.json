My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, looking at the backstory: the dad had an affair with a grad student about 10 years younger. The mom had severe mental health issues, got hospitalized, and after coming out, the dad tried to stay committed. The cheating didn't cause her mental health issues, but he took advantage when she was away. Then, the mom discovered the affair through his phone, leading to a nasty divorce. \n\nThe mom is portrayed as being very difficult, with a history of being morbidly obese, angry, and cruel to the dad. She's also been mentally unstable, even sending deputies to the dad and making false accusations. She's pressuring the author to take her side, giving her letters to pass to the dad and making hurtful comments.\n\nThe author's dad, on the other hand, acknowledges his mistake, tried to reconcile after the affair, and is being reasonable in the divorce. He's been supportive of the author and told her to be respectful to the mom. The author is caught in the middle, but she's clearly taking her dad's side because she sees the mom's behavior as abusive and the dad as trying to make things right.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are that the dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues and has been abusive towards the dad. The author is influenced by the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake and the mom's manipulative behavior. \n\nIn such situations, it's common for children to take sides based on their perception of fairness and the behavior of each parent. The author isn't choosing sides just because of the affair, but because she sees the mom as being more harmful and the dad as trying to do the right thing despite his mistake. The mom's actions, including manipulating the author and being abusive, likely justify the author's decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for taking her dad's side given the circumstances. The dad's infidelity is a mistake, but his subsequent actions and the mom's continued harmful behavior play a significant role here. The author's choice is influenced by the overall dynamic and the need to support the parent who is trying to make amends and being reasonable in the divorce.\n"
