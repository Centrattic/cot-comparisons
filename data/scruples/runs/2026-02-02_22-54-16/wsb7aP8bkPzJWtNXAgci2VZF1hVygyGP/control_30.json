My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom. That's generally considered wrong in most relationships. But there's a lot of backstory here. The mom had mental health issues, sometimes abusive behavior towards the dad. She got admitted to a mental institution. The dad had an affair during a time when the mom was going through a hard period, but he broke it off after she recovered. Then, after the divorce started, the mom is acting out, using manipulative tactics, involving the police, sending videos to his workplace, and pressuring the daughter to take her side.\n\nThe daughter, who's 18 and graduating high school, is caught in the middle. The dad is being honest and trying to move on, while the mom is being abusive and controlling. The daughter feels she's taking her dad's side because he admitted fault and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is being hostile and manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Taking sides can be complex. The dad's cheating is a big deal, but the mom's behavior after the affair is even more toxic. The daughter is caught in a situation where one parent is being honest and trying to move on, while the other is using psychological abuse. In such cases, children often align with the parent who is more stable and less toxic. The dad's actions were wrong, but he took responsibility. The mom's behavior is more about control and retaliation, which isn't justified.\n\nSo, considering the context, the daughter isn't in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The answer is B.\n"
