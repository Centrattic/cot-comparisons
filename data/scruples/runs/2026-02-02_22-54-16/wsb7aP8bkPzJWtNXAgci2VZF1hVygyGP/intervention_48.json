My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are getting divorced after a long, complicated marriage. The dad cheated, which is a big deal, but then he broke it off with the other person and tried to reconcile. The mom had mental health issues, got hospitalized, and then after the affair was discovered, the divorce became really contentious. The mom is acting out, harassing the dad, even involving the police in a fake threat scenario. The author (an 18-year-old daughter) is caught in the middle, with the dad telling her to be respectful, and the mom demanding her support and giving her negative letters to deliver.\n\nThe author is taking her dad's side, feeling that he's the one who wants to move on, even though he cheated, while the mom is being destructive. The question is if the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here. The dad cheated, but then tried to make amends. The mom has mental health struggles and is retaliating with extreme behavior. The daughter is being pressured by both parents but is siding with the dad. \n\nI need to consider whether taking one parent's side in a situation like this is inherently wrong. The dad admitted his mistake and tried to work things out. The mom is being abusive and manipulative. The daughter isn't taking the side of the one who wronged them, but rather the one who is being targeted in a harmful way. \n\nAlso, the daughter is an adult, about to graduate high school, so she's in a position where she can make her own decisions. The mom is clearly in a bad mental state, and the dad is trying to handle the situation responsibly. The daughter's support might be a way to help the dad survive the toxic environment created by the mom.\n\nCheating is a serious issue, but the context here is complex. The dad's actions led to the divorce, but the mom's reaction is extreme and malicious. The daughter's empathy towards the dad, given the mom's behavior, makes sense. It's hard to say the daughter is in the wrong when she's trying to support the parent who is being unfairly targeted, even if that parent had a past mistake. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The daughter is navigating a difficult situation, and her choice to support the dad, who is being treated poorly by the mom, isn't wrong. The dad's cheating is part of the problem, but the mom's subsequent behavior is arguably worse. The daughter isn't excusing the cheating, but she's acknowledging the broader context and the abuse from the mom. That's a reasonable stance.\n"
