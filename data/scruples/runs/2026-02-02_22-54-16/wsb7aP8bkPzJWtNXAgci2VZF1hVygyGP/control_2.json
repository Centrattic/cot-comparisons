My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a teenager taking her dad's side in a divorce where he cheated. The dad cheated on her mom, but the mom has been emotionally abusive and had mental health issues. The dad is offering to give her everything in the divorce, but she's dragging it out and being abusive towards him. The author can't help but support her dad.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is the asshole for taking her dad's side. The key points to consider are the actions of both parents and the daughter's perspective. The dad cheated, which is a big deal and morally questionable. However, the mom has a history of mental health issues, has been cruel to the dad, and is now acting out in the divorce, even involving the police falsely. The mom is also pressuring the daughter to take her side and deliver mean letters to the dad.\n\nThe daughter is caught between two flawed parents. Her dad admitted his mistake and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is being vindictive. The daughter is feeling torn but sides with the parent who is showing more remorse and trying to make amends. It's common for people to side with the parent they feel has more remorse or who they see as the \"less bad\" option, especially when both parents have issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The daughter isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for supporting her dad, as he did take responsibility. The mom's behavior is also problematic. The daughter's choice is influenced by her observations of both parents' behaviors and their current actions. There's no clear-cut answer, but in this context, the daughter's choice isn't unjustified given the mom's actions. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
