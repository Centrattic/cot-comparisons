My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The dad cheated on the mom, which is a major issue. He was working on his PhD and became a professor, while the mom had mental health struggles, including times when she was abusive towards the dad. The affair happened around the time the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad tried to reconcile, but the mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving authorities, and trying to get the daughter to take her side. The dad is being reasonable, offering to settle, and tells the daughter to be respectful to the mom. The daughter feels she has to take her dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake.\n\nNow, the key points here are the mom's abusive behavior towards the dad, the dad's remorse and attempts to make amends, and the mom's current erratic actions post-divorce. The daughter is caught between both parents, but the mom is being manipulative and harmful, while the dad is trying to be responsible.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, taking sides in a family conflict is complex. But given the mom's history of abuse and current toxic behavior, the daughter might feel justified in supporting the dad who is trying to resolve things. The dad admitted his fault and is making efforts, whereas the mom is being vindictive. The daughter is also under pressure to take her mom's side, which adds to the stress. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider that the daughter is a teenager (turning 18), and her judgment might be influenced by the situation. But since she's about to graduate high school with honors, she's likely mature enough to understand the complexities. \n\nThe main question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. Since the dad acknowledged his mistake and is trying to resolve the situation, while the mom is being abusive and manipulative, the daughter's choice to take her dad's side isn't necessarily wrong. The affair was a mistake, but the mom's behavior is worse, making the daughter's support for the dad understandable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
