My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for taking her dad's side during the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The dad cheated on the mom, which is a big deal. But there's also a lot of backstory about the mom having mental health issues, being abusive, and the dad working hard to get his PhD and career. The mom is described as having periods where she's really unkind to the dad and the child, and now she's using the divorce to harass him. The dad acknowledges his mistake and wants to move on, while the mom is acting out, even involving law enforcement in a questionable way.\n\nThe OP, who's 18 and about to graduate high school, is caught in the middle. The dad tells her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side and even giving her hostile letters to deliver. The OP feels it's easy to side with the dad because of the mom's behavior and the dad's efforts to reconcile after his mistake.\n\nNow, the question is whether the OP is in the wrong. The key points here are the dad's infidelity versus the mom's ongoing mental health struggles and abusive behavior. The dad did cheat, but the mom's actions post-divorce are extreme and potentially abusive. The OP is choosing her dad's side, which could be seen as understandable given the mom's actions. However, the dad's initial cheating is a significant issue. But the situation is complex, with the mom's mental health and the dad's subsequent effort to make amends. The OP isn't responsible for the dad's actions, but she's reacting to the mom's behavior. \n\nIn these types of situations, it's common for children to take sides based on which parent is more supportive or abusive. The dad is trying to move forward and take responsibility, while the mom is acting out. The OP isn't necessarily in the wrong for aligning with the parent who seems to be more stable and supportive despite the cheating. The mom's actions post-divorce are problematic, which might justify the OP's stance. So, the answer is likely B (No), because the OP is responding to a difficult situation and the mom's behavior complicates things.\n"
