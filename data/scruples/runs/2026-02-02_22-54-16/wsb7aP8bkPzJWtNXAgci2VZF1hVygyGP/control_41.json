My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a teenager taking her dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated on her mom. The mom has a history of mental health issues, being morbidly obese, and being angry. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad broke it off later, but the mom is now causing a lot of drama, even involving the police and sending videos. The author feels she's taking her dad's side because he admitted fault and is trying to end the marriage, while the mom is being abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The dad cheated, which is a major issue. But the mom has her own problems, including mental health struggles and a history of being abusive. The author is caught in the middle, pressured by both parents. The mom is demanding the author take her side and even gives her letters to deliver, which are negative towards the dad. The dad is asking the author to be respectful to the mom, but the mom's behavior seems more toxic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are that the dad admitted fault and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is engaging in hostile behavior. The author isn't taking sides out of ignorance but because she sees the dad's wrongdoing and the mom's ongoing abuse. The dad's cheating was a mistake, but he's taking responsibility. The mom's actions post-divorce are more about retaliation and harm. \n\nIn terms of the author's perspective, she's 18, about to graduate high school, so she's likely looking to move forward. Taking her dad's side might be a way to avoid further conflict with the mom who is clearly being harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting herself and aligning with the parent who is trying to make things right. The dad's cheating was a choice, but he's owning up to it, whereas the mom is using the situation to cause more pain. \n\nSo, considering all this, it seems the author isn't the asshole. She's reacting to the mom's abusive behavior and the dad's attempts to resolve things. The answer should be B (No).\n"
