My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether taking the dad's side in the divorce, despite him cheating, makes them the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital for depression. The dad broke it off after she got out, but the mom, who has mental health issues, is being really hostile and causing problems during the divorce. The mom is sending the kid nasty letters to give to the dad and making demands. The dad, on the other hand, is being more reasonable, trying to get the divorce done and telling the kid to be respectful to the mom.\n\nThe kid is 18, graduating high school, and has seen both parents' behaviors. The dad had a history of working hard to get his PhD and is now a professor. The mom has had periods of being great, but also times of being abusive and mentally unstable. The kid is taking the dad's side because the mom is being toxic and the dad is trying to move on. \n\nNow, the question is whether the kid is wrong for taking the dad's side. The key points here are the mom's behavior\u2014she's been abusive, manipulative, and has mental health issues. The dad cheated but then stopped, tried to reconcile, and is being reasonable post-cheating. The kid is caught in the middle, and the mom is pressuring them to take her side, which they're refusing to do.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, taking sides in a parental conflict can be tricky. However, if one parent is being abusive or manipulative, it's less about taking sides and more about supporting the healthier parent. The dad admitted his mistake, is trying to resolve things, and isn't pressuring the kid. The mom is the one being unreasonable, using the kid as a go-between for hostile messages. The kid's choice to support the dad seems justified given the mom's behavior. The dad's infidelity is a factor, but the mom's subsequent actions are arguably worse.\n\nSo, the kid isn't in the wrong for taking the dad's side. The answer should be B (No).\n"
