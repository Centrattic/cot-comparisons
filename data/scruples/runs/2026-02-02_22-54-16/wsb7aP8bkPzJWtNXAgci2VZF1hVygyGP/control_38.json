My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their father's side in a divorce where the father cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is 18, about to graduate high school. The parents had the child when they were teenagers. The father got a PhD and became a professor, while the mother has had mental health issues, including periods of obesity, depression, and anger. The father cheated by hooking up with a younger grad student during a time when the mother was hospitalized. The mother then found out, leading to a messy divorce with her harassing the father, even involving law enforcement in a deceptive way. The father is trying to move on, while the mother is resistant, making the author feel caught in the middle.\n\nThe author feels torn between parents. The father admitted his mistake and wants to end the marriage amicably, while the mother is acting out, even making the author deliver harsh letters to the father. The author can't help but side with the father, given the mother's behavior and the father's attempts to reconcile and move forward.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the father's side. Let's consider the dynamics here. The father did cheat, which is a major betrayal. However, the mother's mental health issues and her subsequent actions (like the sheriff's deputies incident) are also problematic. The author is a minor, trying to navigate a toxic situation. The father is encouraging respect for the mother, while the mother is pressuring the author to take her side and even uses the child as a messenger in her attacks.\n\nIn such cases, it's common for children to feel allegiance to the parent who is trying to maintain a positive relationship and who is not engaging in manipulative or harmful behaviors. The father, despite his initial mistake, is trying to make amends and is being reasonable in the divorce. The mother's actions are more emotionally abusive, not just towards the father but potentially towards the child as well by assigning the child to deliver negative messages.\n\nThe author's choice to side with the father could be seen as a natural response to the mother's manipulative tactics and the father's genuine efforts to resolve the situation. The father's cheating is a significant issue, but the mother's ongoing harmful behavior might outweigh that in the context of the child's well-being. The child is not responsible for the parents' actions, and siding with the parent who is being more constructive isn't necessarily wrong, especially when the other parent is being toxic.\n\nThere's a balance here. The father made a mistake, but he's taking responsibility and trying to move forward. The mother's actions are more harmful and ongoing. The author isn't choosing sides based on the infidelity alone but based on the overall behavior and treatment towards the author and each other. The author isn't in a position to judge the full context of the parents' relationship, but their personal experience with both parents' actions is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're responding to the mother's manipulative and harmful behavior, and the father's efforts to repair the relationship post-cheating. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
