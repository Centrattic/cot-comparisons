My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is an 18-year-old girl whose parents are getting divorced. Her dad cheated on her mom, but her mom has been mentally unstable and sometimes abusive. The dad got a PhD and is a professor, but he cheated with a younger grad student when the mom was hospitalized. Now the mom is acting out, making false claims, and trying to involve the author in her drama by giving her letters to deliver to the dad and demanding she take her side. The author feels she's taking her dad's side because of his cheating, but also because the mom is being abusive and the dad is trying to make peace.\n\nFirst, the dad admitted to cheating. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so the author taking his side despite that might seem odd. But the mom's behavior is also extreme\u2014she's been in a mental institution, is currently causing trouble, and is trying to manipulate the daughter. The daughter is told to deliver harsh letters from the mom to the dad, which is pressuring her to take sides. The dad is trying to be respectful and wants the divorce to be finalized, showing responsibility.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are the mom's mental health and abusive behavior versus the dad's infidelity. The author isn't excusing the dad's actions but is also seeing the mom's toxic behavior. The dad is trying to move past his mistake, while the mom is escalating the conflict. The daughter's actions are influenced by the dad's honesty and the mom's manipulation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is likely not in the wrong. The dad acknowledging his mistake and trying to resolve things shows accountability. The mom's behavior is more harmful and manipulative. The daughter is caught in the middle, and taking her dad's side in this context, given the mom's actions, isn't necessarily wrong. People can have complex reasons for taking sides, especially when one parent is being abusive. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
