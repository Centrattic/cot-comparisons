My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about supporting their father in a divorce where he cheated, but the mother is also described as having mental health issues and being abusive. The author is 18 and feels conflicted about taking their dad's side.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The father cheated, which is generally considered a wrong action. But the mother has a history of being verbally abusive, getting very angry, and even making false accusations. The father acknowledged his mistake and is trying to make amends by offering everything to end the divorce. The mother, on the other hand, is using the divorce as a way to retaliate and harm the father, including involving sheriff deputies and sending videos to his workplace. \n\nThe author is not taking sides in a way that's causing direct harm; they are just being respectful to the father and not delivering the letters from the mother. The mother is pressuring the author to take her side, but the author is resisting, which makes sense given the mother's actions. The father is admitting fault, and the author is trying to support him despite his infidelity. \n\nCheating is a significant issue, but the mother's behavior is also problematic. The author's position isn't about excusing the father's actions but rather understanding the context. They are not in a position to control the parents' actions but can choose their own supportive stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking their father's side. \n\nIn many cases, children in such situations are caught in the middle and have to make a choice based on their perception of the situation. Since the mother is being toxic and the father is taking responsibility, the author's support for the father isn't necessarily wrong. The key points are the mother's mental health issues, her abusive behavior, and the father's acknowledgment of his mistake. The author isn't being malicious; they're responding to the ongoing conflict and their father's efforts to resolve it. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not at fault for supporting their father when the mother is acting in a harmful manner. The author's actions are a personal choice in a complicated family situation where both parents have flaws, but the mother is being more damaging in the divorce proceedings.\n"
