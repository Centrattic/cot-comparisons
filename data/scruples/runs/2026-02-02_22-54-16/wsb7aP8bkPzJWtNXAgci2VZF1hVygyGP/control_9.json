My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side during the divorce, even though the dad cheated on their mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are both in their 30s, and the author is an 18-year-old about to graduate high school. The dad got a PhD and is a professor now. The mom has struggled with mental health issues, including depression, obesity, and anger. She was hospitalized for severe depression. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital, and then tried to reconcile after breaking it off. The mom found out through snooping, which led to a nasty divorce. She's been causing a lot of issues, like calling the cops on the dad, sending videos to his department, and demanding the author take her side. The dad, on the other hand, admits his mistake and wants to move on.\n\nThe author is taking the dad's side because of the mom's behavior, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole. \n\nHmm. Let's think about the dynamics here. The dad cheated, which is definitely wrong. But the mom has a history of mental health problems and has been abusive towards the dad. The author is caught in the middle, and the mom is pressuring them to take her side, even giving them letters to deliver. The dad, on the other hand, is asking the author to be respectful to the mom and not take sides. \n\nNow, taking sides in a divorce can be complicated. The author is a teenager, which is a tough age, and being caught between two parents who are both flawed. The dad's cheating is a clear wrong, but the mom's actions are also harmful. The author is likely trying to protect the dad from the mom's harassment. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the dad did cheat, so the author is supporting the one who committed infidelity. However, the mom's behavior is equally toxic. The author might feel more empathy towards the dad because he's being targeted by the mom's actions. The key here is whether the author is wrong for taking sides. \n\nIn many cases, it's considered healthy for children to maintain a relationship with both parents, but when one parent is abusive or toxic, it's reasonable to distance oneself. The mom's actions, like involving the police falsely and spreading the video to his workplace, are serious. The dad is trying to end the marriage amicably but is being harassed. \n\nThe author is 18, an adult now, graduating high school. They might be making a mature decision to support the dad who is trying to move on. The mom's demands for the author to take her side and deliver negative messages could be seen as manipulative. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, it's a judgment call. However, the dad's cheating is a past mistake, while the mom is currently engaging in harmful behavior. The author is trying to avoid being dragged into the mom's vendetta. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're navigating a complex family situation where both parents have flaws, but the dad is trying to move forward, while the mom is being abusive. Taking the dad's side in this context is understandable given the mom's actions.\n"
