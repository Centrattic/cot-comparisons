My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated by hooking up with a grad student while the mom was in the hospital. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including depression and anger. After the affair, the dad tried to reconcile but then the mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving the police, and trying to get the daughter to take her side. The dad has admitted fault and is trying to resolve things, while the mom is being manipulative.\n\nThe daughter is 18, about to graduate high school. The dad told her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side. The daughter feels she's taking the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's admission of guilt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nIn these situations, taking sides in a divorce can be complex. The dad cheated, but the mom has been abusive and mentally unstable, even to the daughter. The daughter isn't being asked to reject the mom entirely but is choosing the dad because of his acknowledgment of fault and the mom's manipulative behavior. \n\nIs it wrong for the daughter to take the dad's side? Well, the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to fix things. The mom is the one being vindictive. The daughter isn't supporting the cheating as right, but she's understanding the context. People often take sides based on who is being more harmful. Since the mom is the one being abusive and manipulative, the daughter's choice might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No). The daughter isn't in the wrong because she's responding to the mom's behavior and the dad's accountability.\n"
