My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is 18, about to graduate high school, and caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. Her dad cheated on her mom, who has a history of mental health issues. The dad got a PhD and is a professor now. The mom has had periods of being great and others where she's been obese, angry, and abusive towards the kids and the dad. The cheating happened when the mom was hospitalized for depression, and the dad took advantage of that situation. After the mom got out, the dad tried to reconcile but then broke it off. The mom found out about the affair and the divorce became very contentious, with her using manipulative tactics like involving the police and sending the dad in handcuffs to his workplace. \n\nThe author is taking her dad's side, even though he cheated. The dad is being respectful and trying to make amends, while the mom is aggressive, demanding the author take her side, and sending her to deliver harsh letters. The author feels she can't help but side with the dad because of the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with her dad despite his infidelity. \n\nFrom a typical moral standpoint, cheating is a serious issue. However, in many cases, if one parent is abusive or manipulative, the other's actions might be seen as a response. The dad here did cheat, but the mom's behavior is also extreme. The author is in a tough spot, being a teenager or young adult, and her judgment might be influenced by the mom's manipulative tactics. \n\nThe key points are: the dad cheated, but the mom has a history of mental health issues and abusive behavior. The dad is trying to be responsible and make amends, while the mom is using the child as an intermediary in the conflict. The author's loyalty might be swayed by seeing the dad's efforts and the mom's toxicity.\n\nIn some perspectives, taking sides in a divorce can be complex. The fact that the author is being pressured by the mom to take her side might lead her to feel more empathy towards the dad. However, the dad's infidelity is a clear wrong, but the context (mom's prior abuse) might mitigate that. \n\nConsidering that the mom is using the child for emotional manipulation, the author's sympathy towards the dad might be justified. Also, the dad is taking responsibility and trying to move forward. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, as both parents have flaws, but the mom's actions are more harmful. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because the situation is nuanced, and the mom's behavior is a significant factor. However, it's a tough call since cheating is a big deal. But given the context of the mom's actions, the author's perspective is understandable.\n"
