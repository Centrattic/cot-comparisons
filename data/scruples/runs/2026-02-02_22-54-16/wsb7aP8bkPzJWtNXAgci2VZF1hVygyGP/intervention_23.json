My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether taking the dad's side in the divorce, despite him cheating, makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The author's parents are divorced. The dad cheated when the mom was in a mental health crisis. The mom has a history of mental health issues, including periods of being very unstable, which affects her behavior towards both the dad and the author. After the affair, the dad tried to reconcile, but the mom discovered it and the divorce became contentious. The mom is reportedly acting out, using extreme measures, and putting pressure on the author to take her side. The dad, on the other hand, is trying to move on and has been respectful towards the mom, even offering to give up things to get the divorce finalized.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school, and feels caught between both parents. The dad has been open about his mistakes and is trying to fix things, while the mom is manipulative and using the child as a middleman. The author can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior, which seems toxic and harmful.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The dad admitted his wrongdoing, tried to make amends, and wants the divorce to move forward. The mom is being abusive, both emotionally and possibly legally (like involving the police without cause). The author is a minor in this scenario, and the parents' actions have a significant impact on them. Choosing a parent isn't necessarily wrong when one parent is clearly in the wrong or being abusive. The author isn't taking sides just because the dad cheated; they're taking his side because the mom's actions are harmful and he's trying to resolve the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's abusive behavior towards the author and the dad, the dad's acknowledgment of his mistake, and the overall toxic environment created by the mother. The author is a teenager dealing with their parents' divorce, which is already hard, and the mom's actions exacerbate that. The author isn't being disrespectful to the mom; they're trying to escape the harassment and support the parent who is making a genuine effort.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're responding to the mom's manipulative and harmful behavior, and the dad is taking responsibility for his actions. Choosing the parent who isn't trying to emotionally abuse them isn't being an asshole.\n"
