My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student, which is a big deal. The mom has mental health issues, has been admitted to a mental institution, and has been abusive and neglectful at times. The dad, on the other hand, became a professor, worked hard, and is now trying to reconcile with the mom after the affair but she's retaliating by dragging things out and involving the police.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school with honors. Both parents have had a tough time, with the dad cheating but also the mom being unstable. The author is being pressured by the mom to take her side, but feels empathy for the dad because of the mom's behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the dad's side.\n\nIn these situations, emotions run high. The dad's infidelity is a clear wrongdoing, but the mom's behavior is also toxic and abusive. The author is caught in the middle, and taking sides is a common issue in parent divorce scenarios. The key points are that the mom is manipulating the author into hating the dad, while the dad is remorseful and trying to make things right. The author's feelings are understandable given the mom's behavior\u2014like the incident with the sheriff's deputies and the video. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because taking sides in a complex, emotionally charged family situation is not a black-and-white issue. The mom's actions are harmful, and the author's natural inclination to support the parent who is more present and remorseful is human. While the dad did cheat, the context of the mom's instability and his subsequent attempts to fix things matter. The author isn't responsible for their feelings, especially when one parent is actively trying to undermine the other. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
