My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated by hooking up with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. The mom has mental health issues and acted out, including false accusations and harassment. The daughter is 18, and her dad is taking responsibility, offering to give her everything to finalize the divorce. The mom is the one being difficult, sending the daughter letters to give to the dad, and being abusive. The daughter feels she's taking her dad's side because he admitted fault and is trying to make amends, while the mom is being toxic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for supporting her dad despite his infidelity. The user thinks she's not in the wrong. \n\nI should consider the context: the dad cheated but took responsibility. The mom's behavior is more harmful, with mental health issues leading to abusive actions. The daughter is in a tough position, caught between a parent who admitted fault and tried to fix things, and a parent who is emotionally abusive. \n\nTaking a side is complicated here. The daughter isn't taking the dad's side just because he's her dad, but because he's shown remorse and is trying to move on, while the mom is actively being harmful. The daughter might be protecting herself from her mom's negativity. \n\nAlso, the daughter is about to graduate high school, so this is a time of independence. Her choice to support her dad might be influenced by wanting to avoid further conflict and to have a healthier relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple answer. But since the daughter is reacting to her mom's toxic behavior and the dad's accountability, it's more about the dynamics of the situation rather than just the affair. The daughter isn't ignoring the dad's mistake but is considering both parents' actions. So, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
