My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is the asshole for taking their dad's side in the divorce even though the dad cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the dad is a professor with a PhD, the mom has mental health issues, including periods of depression and obesity. The dad cheated when the mom was in the hospital. The mom then found out, leading to a nasty divorce. The dad broke off the affair, tried to reconcile, but the mom is hostile and making things difficult. The author, an 18-year-old daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad wants her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side with threats and letters.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are the dad's infidelity, but also the mom's behavior post-divorce. The dad admitted his mistake and tried to make amends, while the mom is acting out, involving authorities, and harassing him. The daughter is influenced by both parents' actions and their treatment of each other.\n\nThe user wants a judgment on the daughter's side. In these types of cases, it's common for the child to empathize with the wronged parent, but here the dad's infidelity is a problem. However, the mom's subsequent actions are also problematic. The daughter isn't the one cheating or causing the initial issue, but she's choosing sides in a conflict where both parents have flaws. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the person's own actions. The daughter isn't cheating or causing harm; she's taking sides. Since she's a minor and the situation is complex, taking her dad's side isn't inherently wrong, especially when the mom is being abusive. The dad's cheating is a factor, but the mom's response is also extreme. The daughter's empathy towards her dad, given the mom's hostile behavior, seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not the asshole.\n"
