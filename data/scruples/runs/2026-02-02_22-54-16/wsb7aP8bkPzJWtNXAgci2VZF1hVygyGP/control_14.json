My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce, given that he cheated. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe parents are divorcing because the dad cheated on the mom, who has mental health issues. The dad got a PhD and is a professor. The mom has had periods of being really unwell, even being hospitalized. After the affair, when the mom was recovering, the dad tried to reconcile but later broke it off. The mom found out through his phone, leading to a messy divorce with her acting out, like calling the police on him. The dad is offering everything to end the divorce, while the mom is causing trouble. The author, an 18-year-old daughter, is taking her dad's side despite his cheating, and the mom is pressuring her to take her side with letters and demands.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the dad's infidelity and the mom's mental health and behavior. The author is torn between the two. Taking a side in a divorce is complicated, especially when one parent has committed an act like cheating, but the other has mental health issues and maybe is acting out in a harmful way.\n\nThe dad admitted fault and is trying to move on. The mom is using the daughter to deliver messages and is being manipulative. The daughter feels she's taking the dad's side because he's the one who cheated, but the mom's behavior is also toxic. The daughter isn't necessarily wrong for sympathizing with the dad, especially since he's acknowledged his mistake and is trying to be respectful. The mom's actions seem more harmful, and the daughter might feel caught in the middle.\n\nIn these situations, it's common for children to feel pressured to take sides. The daughter isn't in the wrong for taking her dad's side, especially when the mom is being manipulative and her behavior is more damaging. The dad's cheating is a wrongdoing, but the daughter is not at fault for choosing to support the parent who is trying to resolve the situation peacefully, even if he made a mistake. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
