My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a teenager taking their dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The dad cheated on the mom with a grad student much younger, which is a clear infidelity. The mom has mental health issues, including severe depression and obesity, and has sometimes been abusive towards the dad. The dad ended the affair and tried to commit again, but the mom found out and the divorce became really contentious. The mom is portrayed as someone who's actively trying to hurt the dad, even using the police to make him look bad. The dad is sorry and wants to move on, while the mom is being vindictive.\n\nThe author, who is 18 and close to graduating high school, is torn. The dad tells them to be respectful and go easy on the mom. The mom, however, forces the author to deliver harsh letters and side with her. The author feels they can't take the mom's side because the dad cheated, but the mom's behavior is also terrible. The author ends up taking the dad's side and questions if they're wrong.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Taking sides in a divorce can be complex. The author isn't a legal entity, but their personal feelings are valid. The dad admitted fault, and the mom is acting out. The author is caught between two problematic parents. The key points are: the dad cheated, but he's trying to make amends; the mom is mentally unstable and toxic. The author isn't choosing sides out of obligation but based on their observations. The question isn't about legal responsibilities but about personal feelings. Since the dad is the one who cheated, but the mom is equally, if not more, toxic in her behavior, the author's choice to side with the dad isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't ignoring the dad's mistake but is acknowledging the mom's vindictiveness. Since they're a teenager, their emotional response is influenced by their experiences. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're navigating a difficult situation where both parents have flaws, and their choice to side with the parent who's more proactive in moving forward isn't inherently wrong.\n"
