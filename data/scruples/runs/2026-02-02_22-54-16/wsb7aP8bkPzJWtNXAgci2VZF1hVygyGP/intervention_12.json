My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce even though he cheated. The author provided a detailed Reddit-style post.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated, but the mom has been emotionally unstable and even abusive. The mom is causing ongoing issues, like calling the police on the dad and sending threatening messages through the author. The dad, on the other hand, admitted his mistake and is trying to make things right by offering everything to finalize the divorce. The author feels torn but ends up taking the dad's side because they see the mom's behavior as the bigger problem.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong for choosing the dad's side. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and wants to know my opinion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking sides in a family conflict is complex. The dad cheated, which is a significant betrayal. However, the mom's actions are also harmful\u2014she's emotionally abusive, manipulative, and even involved law enforcement in a questionable way. The author is caught between both parents' poor behavior. \n\nIn many cases, people take sides based on who they perceive as the primary wrongdoer. Here, the dad admitted his mistake, while the mom is continuing to act out. The author might feel that the dad is trying to resolve things, whereas the mom is dragging it out for her own sake. The author's empathy towards the dad could be because the mom's actions are more overtly harmful and ongoing.\n\nBut is taking the dad's side wrong just because he cheated? The key here is that the author isn't condoning the cheating but is recognizing the mom's worse behavior. The author's choice might be about who is causing more harm in the present. Since the dad is seeking resolution and the mom is being toxic, the author might feel justified in supporting the dad.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should remain neutral or support the mother, especially since she was the one wronged by the dad's infidelity. But given the mom's actions, it's understandable why the author would side with the dad.\n\nIn terms of societal views on such matters, there's often a push for neutrality in parental conflicts, but real-life situations are rarely that simple. The author is an adult now, graduating high school, so their judgment is more mature. They might have a realistic view of both parents' behaviors and are making a choice based on their observations.\n\nSo considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking the dad's side. They are responding to a complex situation where both parents have flaws, but the mom's current actions are more harmful. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
