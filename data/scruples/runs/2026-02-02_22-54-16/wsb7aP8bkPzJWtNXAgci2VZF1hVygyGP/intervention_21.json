My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The parents are divorced, the dad cheated, but there's a lot of backstory. The mom has mental health issues, was admitted to a mental institution, and has been abusive and unstable. The dad, on the other hand, worked hard to get his PhD and became a professor. The affair happened when the mom was in the hospital, and the dad ended it afterward. The mom then became aggressive, involving the police and spreading the video to his department. She's been actively trying to ruin his life post-divorce.\n\nThe author, an 18-year-old daughter, is caught in the middle. The dad asked her to be respectful to the mom, but the mom is pressuring her to take her side, even giving her letters to deliver. The author feels compelled to take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking her dad's side despite his infidelity. \n\nIn these kinds of cases, it's not as simple as just who cheated. The mother's mental health issues and actions post-divorce seem extreme and harmful. The dad admits his mistake and is trying to make amends by offering everything to end the divorce. The daughter is likely affected by her mom's instability and the dad's attempts to be responsible. \n\nThe daughter isn't taking the side because the dad is innocent, but because the mom's behavior is toxic and the dad is taking responsibility. It's a tough situation where the daughter has to protect her relationship with her dad, who is more stable and is seeking to end the conflict. The daughter's choice might be influenced by self-preservation and the need for a stable environment, especially as she's about to graduate high school and transition to adulthood.\n\nSo, considering the mom's actions and the dad's efforts to resolve things, the daughter taking the dad's side isn't necessarily wrong. People can empathize with both sides, but the daughter's well-being and her dad's genuine remorse might make her choice understandable. The answer would likely be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
