My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a daughter taking her dad's side in a divorce where the dad cheated. The parents are getting divorced after a messy situation. The dad had an affair with a younger grad student while the mom was in a mental institution. Then the mom, upon getting out, tried to reconcile but ended up making things worse by involving the police and harassing the dad. The daughter is being pressured by her mom to take her side, but she ends up supporting her dad instead. The question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad did cheat, which is a serious issue. But he admitted his mistake and is trying to make amends by offering everything to get the divorce final. The mom, on the other hand, has been struggling with mental health issues, has had periods of being abusive to both the dad and the daughter, and is now acting out in what seems like vindictive ways post-divorce. The daughter is caught in the middle, with the dad asking her to be respectful to the mom, while the mom is aggressive and demanding support.\n\nThe daughter's choice to take her dad's side might be influenced by the mom's behavior. If the mom has been abusive and is now trying to manipulate the daughter into taking her side, the daughter might be acting in self-defense or aligning with the parent who is more emotionally stable and taking responsibility. The dad, despite his mistake, is trying to handle the situation maturely by offering everything for the divorce. The mom's actions, like involving the police deceptively and sending the video to the department head, seem like they're meant to damage the dad's reputation, which is not healthy.\n\nHowever, the daughter is also a minor, and in some cases, taking sides can complicate family dynamics. But given the mom's behavior and the dad's willingness to accept responsibility, the daughter's choice might be understandable. It's a tough situation, but the key points are the dad's acknowledgment of his fault and the mom's vindictiveness. The daughter is not necessarily in the wrong for choosing to support the parent who is more cooperative and less harmful, even if the dad initially made a mistake. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
