My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking her dad's side in the divorce despite him cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, female, graduating high school. Her parents had her when they were teenagers. Her dad got a PhD and is a professor. Her mom has mental health issues, sometimes abusive towards the author and the dad. The dad cheated on her mom with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. After the mom's release, the dad tried to reconcile but the mom found out about the affair through his phone. The divorce has been messy, with the mom using the police and harassment. The dad is trying to settle, but the mom is making it difficult. The author is taking her dad's side because he admitted fault and the mom is being abusive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for taking her dad's side. The key points here are the dad's infidelity and the mom's mental health and behavior towards both the author and the dad. The author is in a difficult position, caught between a parent who cheated and another who's emotionally abusive. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, taking sides in family conflicts is complex. The dad's cheating is a betrayal, but the mom's behavior is also harmful. The author's perspective is that the dad's actions caused the divorce but he's trying to resolve it, whereas the mom is acting out of spite. The author feels sympathetic towards the dad's efforts and the mom's actions are making her life hard. \n\nIs the author wrong for taking her dad's side? Well, she's an adult now, graduating high school. Her judgment might be influenced by the mom's treatment of her and the dad's remorse. Society often judges cheating as a negative, but the mother's mental health and abusive behavior also play a role. The author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing to support the parent who's being more reasonable post-divorce. However, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her relationship with the dad who's trying to make amends. The Reddit format often looks for whether the person's actions were justified, and here, the author isn't doing anything harmful. She's not taking sides in a way that harms others but is reflecting her feelings based on the situation. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
