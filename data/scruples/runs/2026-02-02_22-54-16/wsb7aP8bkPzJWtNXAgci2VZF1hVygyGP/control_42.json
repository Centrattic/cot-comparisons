My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are both 35, the author is 18. The dad got a PhD and became a professor, which required a lot of work. The mom has had mental health issues, including severe depression, mood swings, and even being admitted to a mental institution. The dad had an affair with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. After the mom was released, the dad ended the affair and tried to stay committed. The mom found out through his phone, leading to a nasty divorce. The mom is acting out, making false accusations, involving the police, and sending the dad in handcuffs to his department head. She's also pressuring the author to take her side, giving her letters to deliver, and making hurtful comments. The dad has been apologetic, told the author to be respectful to the mom, and is trying to move on.\n\nThe author feels they can't help but take the dad's side because of the mom's behavior and the dad's regret. The question is if that's wrong.\n\nI need to consider if siding with the dad, despite his cheating, is justified here. The dad cheated, but the mom has significant mental health issues and is acting out in destructive ways. The author is caught in the middle, and the dad is trying to make amends. The mom is manipulative and hostile, while the dad is more conciliatory. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for children to side with the parent who is more emotionally stable or who shows remorse. The dad's actions were wrong, but he's owning up to them and trying to fix things. The mom's behavior is erratic and harmful, which might make her actions more hurtful to the child. The author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing the parent who is less toxic in their interactions, even if there's guilt over the dad's infidelity. The situation is complex, and taking into account the mental health aspects, the author's choice is understandable. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
