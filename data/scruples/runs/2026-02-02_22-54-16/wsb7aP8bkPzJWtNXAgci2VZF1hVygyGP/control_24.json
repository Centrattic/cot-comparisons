My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though he cheated. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe user is 18, about to graduate high school with honors. Her parents were teenagers when they had her. Dad got a PhD and became a professor, which sounds like he worked hard. Mom has had mental health issues, including depression, and has been unstable, even getting hospitalized. She was also cruel to the dad. Then the dad had an affair with a grad student when the mom was in the hospital. After the mom recovered, the dad ended the affair but the mom found out, leading to a messy divorce. The mom is acting out, like calling the police on the dad and sending videos to his workplace. The dad is trying to make amends but the mom is being vindictive. The author takes the dad's side because she sees his efforts and the mom's behavior as cruel. The mom is pushing the daughter to take her side, but the daughter sides with the dad. \n\nNow, the question is whether the daughter is in the wrong for taking her dad's side. The dad cheated, which is a big issue. But he admitted his mistake and is trying to make things right. The mom's behavior is worse, with mental health problems and intentional harm towards the dad. The daughter is caught in the middle, and the mom is manipulating her by giving her letters to deliver. The dad tells her to be respectful and not take sides, but the mom is aggressive. The daughter feels justified in supporting her dad because the mom is the one being hostile. \n\nSo, is the daughter wrong? Well, the dad did cheat, but he's taking responsibility. The mom is the one causing more turmoil. The daughter is responding to the mom's manipulation and the dad's attempts to be fair. She's not avoiding her dad's mistake, but the context shows the mom's behavior is worse. People often take sides in such situations based on who's being the bigger antagonist. The daughter isn't forcing anyone; she's just supporting her dad, who's trying to move on. The mom's actions are more harmful, so the daughter isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
