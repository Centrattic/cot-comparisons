My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the parents are both 35, and the author is 18. The dad's cheating is a clear ethical issue, but there's context. The mom has a history of mental health struggles, including periods of being \"morbidly obese, miserable, angry\" and even getting admitted to a mental institution. The dad took advantage of her being away during that time. After the mom's recovery, the dad ended the affair but made efforts to stay committed. However, the mom then snoop on his phone, found out, and initiated a nasty divorce. \n\nThe dad acknowledges his mistake and is trying to resolve it amicably, offering everything to get the divorce finalized. The mom, on the other hand, is acting out in various ways, including false accusations and harassment. She's even gotten deputies to confront the dad and sent a video to his department head. The mom is pressuring the author to take her side, giving her letters to deliver and making harsh statements. \n\nThe author feels torn but sides with the dad because of the mom's behavior and the dad's remorse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the dad's cheating is wrong, but the mom's actions post-divorce are extreme and abusive. The author is trying to navigate a difficult situation where one parent is being unreasonable and the other is seeking to make amends. The dad asked the author to be respectful, but the mom is actively antagonizing the author and trying to get her to take her side. \n\nIn family dynamics, it's common for children to feel caught between parents. Taking one side might be necessary if the other parent is being manipulative or harmful. The author isn't just defending the dad's actions but is reacting to the mom's toxic behavior. Since the dad admitted fault and is trying to move on, while the mom is engaging in vindictive actions, the author's choice to support the dad seems like a self-preservation strategy. \n\nThere's no clear-cut answer, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing the dad's side when the mom's actions are more harmful and manipulative. The dad's cheating is a mistake, but the author isn't responsible for that. The focus is on the mom's attempts to involve the author in her conflict, which is often seen as more problematic. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
