My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce, even though the dad cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The dad had an affair with a grad student, which coincided with the mom being in a mental institution. The dad broke it off after the mom was released, but the mom's behavior became really toxic. She's been sending deputies to arrest him, spreading false information, and is generally causing a lot of drama. The mom is also described as being mentally unstable, with periods of depression and anger towards everyone, including the author.\n\nThe author is 18, about to graduate high school, and is caught in the middle. The dad has admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is being very negative and demanding the author take her side. The author feels sympathetic towards the dad because of his efforts to make things right and the mom's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether taking the dad's side makes the author an asshole. The key points here are the dad's cheating, but also the mom's toxic behavior. The author isn't being disrespectful to the mom; they're acknowledging the dad's mistake but also the mom's part in the situation. The author is in a tough spot, and choosing a side might be influenced by the mom's abusive behavior. However, the dad did cheat, so there's a valid reason to criticize him.\n\nBut the author isn't denying the dad's fault. They accept that he messed up but also see the mom's side as being equally problematic. The main issue here is the mom's toxic actions post-divorce, which are making the author's life hard. The author is choosing the side that's less toxic and more respectful, even though the dad had an affair. \n\nIn many cases, taking sides in a divorce can be complex, especially when one parent is being abusive or manipulative. The fact that the author is aware of both parents' faults but is choosing the side that's more constructive might not be wrong. The dad is taking responsibility, while the mom is acting out. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for aligning with the more accountable parent, even if they had a past mistake. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're navigating a difficult situation where one parent is being more harmful, and they're choosing to support the parent who is trying to make things right despite past errors.\n"
