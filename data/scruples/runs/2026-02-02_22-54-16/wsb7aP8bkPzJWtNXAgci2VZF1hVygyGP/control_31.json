My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. \n\nLast year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just \"took advantage\" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. \n\nI know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to \"work it out\" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. \n\n\nMy dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me \"tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him\" and stuff like that. \n\nWith that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their dad's side in the divorce despite the dad cheating. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated, which is a major point. The mom had mental health issues, was admitted to a mental institution, and there's a lot of mutual harm here. The dad tried to reconcile after the affair, but the mom continued to make things difficult, even involving law enforcement in a questionable way. The author mentions that the dad admitted his mistake and is trying to move on, while the mom is acting out, maybe as a way to cope with her own issues. \n\nThe author is caught in the middle, pressured by both parents. The mom wants the author to take her side and even gives her letters to deliver, which is a form of manipulation. The dad, on the other hand, is honest about his actions and wants the author to be respectful to the mom. The author feels sympathy for the dad because of the mom's behavior, even though he cheated. \n\nThe question is if the author is wrong for taking the dad's side. Considering that the dad cheated, but the mom is also being abusive and manipulative, the author's choice might be influenced by the mom's toxic behavior. However, taking the side of the cheater is generally frowned upon, but the context here shows that both parents have flaws. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're reacting to a very difficult situation where the mom is being harmful. The dad's honesty and efforts to move on might make the author's support understandable. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
