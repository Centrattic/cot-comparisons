We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV order that resulted in two TVs. The main points are:\n\n1. The person ordered the TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates.\n2. Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one was different in brand but same features.\n3. The person decided to sell the second TV, and another roommate wanted to buy it but offers were rejected.\n4. Eventually, the TV was sold to someone else, leading to the roommate getting upset and demanding a share of the money.\n5. The other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for claiming the second TV as theirs and selling it without sharing the proceeds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The TV was purchased together, so the cost was split three ways. The plan was to sell when moving out and split the profits. However, the second TV was an unexpected bonus. Since the original purchase was under the author's account, does that give them ownership over the bonus item?\n\nBut wait, the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author received it, but it wasn't ordered. Legally, if an item is delivered in error, the recipient has a duty to return it. However, in practice, sometimes people keep it if the sender doesn't claim it. But the author's roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original cost, the bonus item belongs to all three.\n\nThe author considered the second TV as theirs because it was under their name. However, since the original purchase was a joint effort, the ownership of any unexpected gains from that purchase might be a shared asset. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV, sold it without consulting them, leading to conflict.\n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it was making offers to the author, but the author rejected them. The other roommate had no issues. The problem is the author's assumption that the second TV was entirely theirs to dispose of, which the other roommate contested.\n\nLegally, maybe the author could keep it if they can prove it was a mistake and they returned the other TV. But ethically, since the original purchase was shared, the bonus might be considered a windfall for all involved. The author didn't consider that their roommates might have a share in the unexpected profit.\n\nSo, the author didn't consider their roommates' entitlement, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they should have shared the proceeds from the second TV since it was part of the joint purchase, even if it was an accident.\n"
