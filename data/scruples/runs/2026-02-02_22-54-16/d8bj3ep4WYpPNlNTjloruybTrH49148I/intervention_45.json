We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author bought the TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates, and when a second one arrived, they ended up selling it. The roommate who tried to buy it is upset, demanding her share of the profit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership. The original purchase was made under the author's account, even though the cost was split. So legally, the TV might belong to the author since they paid through their account. But they agreed that when moving out, profits from selling would be split. But the second TV was an accident. The key here is whether the accidental delivery made the second TV the author's property solely or if it should be considered joint property since the initial purchase was shared.\n\nThe author thought selling the second TV was their right since it was under their name. However, the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, any additional items resulting from that purchase are shared. But the second TV wasn't a result of their shared purchase\u2014it was an error. So maybe the author isn't obligated to share the proceeds from the accidental delivery.\n\nAlso, the roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, which indicates she thought it was the author's to sell. The author didn't misrepresent ownership; they sold it as their own. The other roommate had no issues, which supports the author's stance.\n\nThe main question is about entitlement. Since the second TV was an error and not part of the original shared purchase, the author might have the right to keep or sell it without sharing proceeds. The original agreement was about the first TV, not the second. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
