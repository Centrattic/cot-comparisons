We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then selling it.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime. They split the cost with two roommates. The second TV was a free one, probably a mistake by the seller. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled to the second TV because the original purchase was in their name. They tried to sell it, and one roommate kept offering to buy it, but the author eventually sold it to someone else. The angry roommate is now upset and demands a share of the money.\n\nSo, the key points are: the original purchase was the author's, but the cost was split. The second TV was an error. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. The question is whether the roommates should get a share of the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nI need to consider ownership. The original TV's cost was split, so maybe the ownership is shared. But the second TV, being a mistake, might not be part of that agreement. The author ordered it under their own account, so maybe they have sole ownership. However, since they were splitting costs for the original, maybe the second TV's ownership is a gray area. \n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't clarify ownership of the second TV with the roommates. If they thought it was theirs, but the roommates might have expected a share since the original was a shared purchase, then the author's assumption might have been wrong. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's purchase, so the author might have the right to it. \n\nThe angry roommate is upset because she felt entitled, but if there was no agreement about the second TV, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The author didn't owe them a share unless there was an understanding. Since the author sold it without consulting, maybe they should have discussed it, but the entitlement claim might not hold. \n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the second TV was a mistake, and the author's ownership was based on their purchase. However, communication could have been better.\n"
