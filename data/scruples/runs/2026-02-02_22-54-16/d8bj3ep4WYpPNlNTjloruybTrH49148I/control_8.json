We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV purchase shared by three roommates. The key points are:\n\n1. The TV was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways.\n2. An extra TV (same model) was delivered by accident.\n3. The author decided to sell the extra TV, keeping the profit, not sharing it. One roommate was upset and demanded a portion, while the other wasn't.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since the TV was ordered under their name and the original purchase was split, the extra TV was their property. The roommate who wanted to buy it approached the author directly, implying ownership. However, the upset roommate felt entitled to a share of the profit from the second TV.\n\nNow, considering the shared purchase aspect. Even though the TV was ordered under the author's account, the initial purchase was a joint effort. The roommates agreed on splitting costs and profits upon moving out. The second TV, being a free item due to an error, might be considered part of the shared purchase since it resulted from the original order. The author didn't consult the others about the second TV, which could have led to the conflict. The roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, any additional items from that order are communal property. Selling the second TV without consulting them might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since there was an agreement to split profits from the original TV. The author's decision not to share the second TV's profit could be viewed as breaking that agreement implicitly, even if the agreement didn't specifically mention a second TV. The upset roommate's reaction stems from feeling entitled to a share, which the author didn't consider. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving the roommates in the decision about the second TV.\n"
