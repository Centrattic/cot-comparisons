We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about claiming a second TV is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates who split the cost of a TV. The main issue is that an accident delivery happened, resulting in two TVs. The author ordered the TV under their Amazon, which might be the key point here.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered by the author, and the cost was split three ways. The free TV was delivered, and the author decided to sell it. The roommate who wanted to buy it was persistent, but the author sold it instead. The other roommate was okay with it.\n\nThe question is whether the author had the right to sell the second TV. Since the original purchase was under their name, the second TV might have been a result of an Amazon error. If the order was placed by the author, even though the cost was split, the ownership of the second TV might be their responsibility. However, since they were splitting the cost initially, maybe there's an expectation of shared ownership of any additional items? But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates, which could be a problem. Also, the roommate's reaction is based on feeling entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. But legally, if the second TV was a result of an error and the order was under the author's name, it might be their property. Ethically, though, maybe they should have discussed it with roommates. The author didn't consider sharing the profits, which led to conflict. So, the answer might hinge on the initial agreement and whether the second TV was part of that agreement. Since the original agreement was only for one TV, the second is an unexpected bonus. If the author didn't communicate properly, they might share some blame, but technically, since they paid for it via their own account, they might not be wrong. But the conflict arises from the roommate feeling entitled. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement and the author was acting on their own decision, even if they didn't consult others. However, some might argue that since they split the cost of the first, they should have shared the second. But since the second was an accident and the order was under the author's name, it's their responsibility. So B makes sense.\n"
