We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The main points are: the TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, the cost was split three ways, and the second TV was sold by the author. The roommate felt entitled to a share of the money, but the author didn't think they were.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was made under the author's account, but the cost was split among three roommates. So the initial TV is a shared purchase. The second TV was an error, so it's unclear who it belongs to. The author decided to sell it, thinking it was theirs, but the roommate argued they should get a share.\n\nLegally, if the second TV was a mistake, the ownership might not be clear. Since the cost was split, maybe the second TV is also a shared asset? But the original purchase was under the author's name. However, since the roommates were part of the purchase, maybe they have some claim. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV, which could be a point against them. Also, the roommate who tried to buy it from the author might have thought it was a shared asset, hence their entitlement.\n\nBut the author didn't consider the roommates when selling the second TV. If the initial agreement was that the TV was a shared purchase, maybe the second one should also be considered shared. However, the author might have thought that since the second TV was a mistake and not part of the original purchase, it's their personal property. The confusion here is whether the second TV is part of the shared agreement or not.\n\nEthically, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates first. Not doing so might have led to the conflict. The roommate who tried to buy it felt it was the author's, but others might not agree. The author's decision to sell it without consulting might be seen as taking it for themselves, hence the AITA aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be legally in the wrong (since it was their account), ethically they might have a responsibility to share the second TV proceeds, especially since the cost was split. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the ownership of the second TV is solely the author's, but if the shared purchase implies shared ownership of any mistake deliveries, then A. But the initial agreement was only for the first TV. So the author might be in the right.\n"
