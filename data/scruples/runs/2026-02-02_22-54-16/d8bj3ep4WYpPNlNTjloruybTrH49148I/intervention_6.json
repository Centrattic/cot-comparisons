We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that Amazon accidentally delivered. The situation is that they bought one TV with roommates, split the cost, and then got a free one. The author sold the free TV and the other roommate got upset, thinking she was entitled to a share.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the agreement they had. They agreed to split the cost of the original TV and when they moved out, split the profits from selling it. But the second TV was an accident. The author didn't order it, but it came with the same name. The author decided to sell it, and the roommate wanted a cut. \n\nSo, was there an agreement about the second TV? The original agreement was about the TV they ordered. The second one wasn't part of that. The author ordered it under their Amazon, so maybe the free one is their property. The roommate tried to buy it from the author, but the author sold it. The other roommate felt entitled because they split the cost of the original. But the second TV wasn't part of that purchase. \n\nThe author thought the free TV was theirs because it was delivered to their name. Legally, if something is delivered to your name, it's yours, even if you didn't order it? Maybe. But maybe there's a responsibility to inform others if there's a mistake. But in this case, the author didn't know it was a mistake initially. They thought it was a bonus. The roommate's argument is that since they split the cost of the original, they deserve a share of the free one. But the free TV wasn't part of their purchase. \n\nThe author didn't do anything wrong by keeping the free TV. They had no obligation to share it unless there was an agreement. The original agreement didn't mention the second TV. The roommate's reaction seems unfair. The author was trying to do the right thing by selling it and not giving a cut. The other roommate's anger is misplaced. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
