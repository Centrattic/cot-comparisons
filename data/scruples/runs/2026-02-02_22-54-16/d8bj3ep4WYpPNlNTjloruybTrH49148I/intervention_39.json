We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The situation involves roommates splitting the cost of the original TV, ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then a second TV showed up, identical but different brand. The author decided to sell the extra TV and didn't share the profits with the other roommate who got upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the agreement between the roommates. The original TV was a joint purchase with shared costs, and they agreed to split profits when selling. But the second TV was an error. The author thought it was theirs to handle, but the roommate felt entitled to a share.\n\nWait, the original cost was split three ways for the first TV. The second TV was a mistake, so it wasn't part of the original agreement. But the author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. So legally, maybe the second TV is their property since it was delivered to their name. But the roommate argued they should have a share because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nThe author didn't consider the other roommate's claim, but the other roommate approached the author directly to buy the TV, indicating they thought it was the author's. The author sold it, and the roommate got angry about not getting a portion. \n\nIs there an ethical obligation to split the proceeds? The original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV was an error, so maybe it's the author's to handle. However, since they were roommates, maybe there's an expectation of sharing. But the author didn't have an agreement about the second TV. The other roommate's demands seem to come from feeling entitled, but without prior agreement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, answer B, the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake TV wasn't part of the original deal, and the roommate didn't have a right to it unless they had an agreement. The author handled it without sharing the profit, but there's no indication they should have. The roommate's reaction is more about their own expectations not being set beforehand.\n"
