We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV ordered by one roommate, split costs with two others. Then, two TVs were delivered. The author took the second TV, sold it, and the other roommate got upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So, technically, the purchase was a joint decision even though the author placed the order. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. Now, the question is whether the second TV belongs to the author or should be split among roommates.\n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered to the shared house and had their name on it. But since the purchase was a shared expense, maybe the second TV is a mistake in the joint order. The roommates might argue that the free TV is a result of the group's purchase, so they should all share the benefit. However, the author might argue that since they placed the order and the mistake was on Amazon's end, they have the right to the second TV.\n\nThe key points here are: the initial agreement about splitting costs and profits, the ownership of the second TV, and the expectations each party had. The author didn't inform the roommate about the second TV's existence until after selling it, which led to conflict. Even though the roommate was trying to buy it from the author, that doesn't necessarily mean the author had exclusive ownership. The author might have assumed they could do with the second TV as they pleased, but since the purchase was a group effort, the roommates might feel entitled to a share of the extra TV's value. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the free TV was a result of the group's purchase. Despite the order being under their name, the shared cost implies shared ownership of the purchase. The mistake in delivery might be considered an unexpected benefit that should be split among all contributors. The author's decision to sell the TV without consulting the others could be seen as selfish, even if they believed it was theirs. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). However, if the mistake was entirely Amazon's fault and the original order was the author's, then the second TV might belong to them. But the shared expense complicates that. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so the second TV's value should be shared.\n"
