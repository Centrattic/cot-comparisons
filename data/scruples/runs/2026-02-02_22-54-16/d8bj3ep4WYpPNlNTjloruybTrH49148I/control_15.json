We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The author took the second TV, sold it, and the roommate who tried to buy it from them is upset, demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the initial agreement. They agreed to split the cost of the TV, and when moving out, sell it and split the profits. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon account, but they all agreed to share the cost. So the original TV is a shared purchase, even though the author paid for it initially. \n\nThe second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The question is whether this second TV belongs to the author or if it's considered part of the shared purchase. Since the second TV was an accident, maybe it's considered a separate item. However, the cost wasn't split for it. The author took it upon themselves to sell it, thinking it was theirs. But if the original purchase was a joint one, maybe the second TV is also part of that arrangement? Or maybe not, because the second TV wasn't ordered intentionally. \n\nThe author's roommate argued that they're entitled to a share. But the original purchase was split three ways, so maybe the second TV, being a mistake, would also require splitting the proceeds? However, the author didn't order the second TV, so maybe it's their property since it was delivered to their name. Also, the roommate was trying to buy it from the author, which might imply that the roommate thought the author had the right to sell it. But the author ended up giving it to someone else. \n\nThe key points are: the original TV was a shared purchase, the second was a mistake. The author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. But since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, maybe it's the author's to handle. However, the roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, any errors related to that purchase (like an extra TV) should be shared. \n\nI think the author made a mistake by not consulting the roommates about the second TV. Even though the original purchase was shared, the second TV being a mistake might be considered the author's property because it was delivered to their name. However, the fact that the roommates were involved in the original purchase and the mistake might affect them as well. The author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates to clarify ownership. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't inform the roommates and took the second TV as their own without considering the shared context, then maybe they should have split the proceeds. But if the second TV was a mistake and not part of the original agreement, then the author isn't obligated. However, since they were sharing the original purchase, maybe the second TV's value should also be shared. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether the second TV is considered part of the original purchase. Since it was an accident, it's unclear. The author might have thought it was theirs because it was delivered to their account. But the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they should have discussed the second TV. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not communicating and assuming they could handle it alone.\n"
