We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation: They moved into a house with two roommates. They bought a TV together, split the cost. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one is different in brand but same features. The author decided to sell the second TV, not considering the roommates. One roommate kept trying to buy it but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else. The roommate who wanted it is upset and demands her share of the money. The other roommate isn't.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong because the original TV was bought under their name, and the second one was a mistake. They didn't think the roommates were entitled to the second TV's money.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: The original purchase was a joint decision, split the cost. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author took the second one and sold it without consulting the roommates. Now, the roommate is upset because she thought she was entitled to a share.\n\nWait, but the original TV was bought with shared funds, so maybe the second TV, being a mistake, is also considered communal property? Even though it came under the author's order? Because the initial purchase was a shared expense. If the mistake was due to the order placed under the author's account, but funded collectively, does that mean the second TV also belongs to all three?\n\nThe author might have made an assumption that since the original was under their name, the second one is theirs too. But since the cost was split, maybe the roommates have a claim. Especially since the original agreement was that when moving out, they'd split profits from selling the original TV. But the second one was a free extra. The problem is the author took the second TV and sold it, not considering the roommates might expect a share.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't owe them, the fact that the initial purchase was a shared expense might imply that any unexpected gains (like the second TV) should also be shared. Otherwise, it's a windfall, but the question is whether the roommates have a claim.\n\nIn some cases, if something is bought jointly, any errors or extra items would be considered communal. The author might have acted out of self-interest without considering that. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates.\n\nBut the author argues that the original TV was ordered under their name, so the second one was automatically theirs. However, since the initial purchase was a joint decision and funds were split, the author might not have exclusive ownership over the second TV. Therefore, the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates and perhaps split the proceeds from selling it.\n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider that the roommates might have a claim to the second TV's value since the original purchase was shared. The mistake in delivery could be considered a communal gain, so the author should have shared the proceeds.\n"
