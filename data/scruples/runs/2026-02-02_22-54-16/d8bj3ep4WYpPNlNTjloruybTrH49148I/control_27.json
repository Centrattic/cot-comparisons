We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it without splitting the proceeds with their roommate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the person moved in with two roommates, they bought a TV together, split the cost, and agreed on splitting profits when they sell. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was identical in features but a different brand. The person decided to sell the second TV, and one roommate was upset about not getting a share, while the other was fine.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The original TV was bought by all three roommates, with costs split. The agreement was that when they move out, they'd sell the original TV and split profits three ways.\n2. The second TV was an accidental delivery. The person assumed it was theirs because it was ordered under their Amazon and sold it without consulting the roommates.\n3. One roommate kept trying to buy it from the author but was turned down. Then, when the author sold it to someone else, that roommate got angry and demanded a share.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, and since the roommate approached them specifically about buying it, they didn't think the others were entitled to a share. But the roommate felt entitled to a portion, leading to conflict.\n\nHmm. Let's think about ownership and agreements. The original TV was a shared purchase with a clear agreement. The second TV was an error. The author ordered the original TV under their Amazon, which might imply they took ownership of the purchase. But the cost was split, so maybe the ownership was shared. But the second TV was an accident. The question is whether the second TV was their property to claim or if it belonged to everyone since it was delivered to the shared house.\n\nIn legal terms, if something is delivered to a shared address, especially where multiple people are paying for a purchase, it might be considered joint property unless there's a clear agreement otherwise. The author ordered it under their Amazon, but since the cost was split, maybe the roommates had an interest in the purchase. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase; it was an error. The author might have had the right to keep it since it was a mistake, but if the delivery was to the house, perhaps all residents have a claim.\n\nBut the author's roommates might argue that since they were part of the original purchase and the second TV was delivered to their shared home, they have a right to it. The author didn't consult them about the second TV, which could be seen as a problem. Even if it was an accident, if it's on their property, maybe it's considered communal property. The author took it upon themselves to sell it without discussing with everyone, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the original purchase was under the author's account, and the second TV might have been a result of their order. So perhaps the author had the right to handle it. The problem is that there was no prior agreement about handling unexpected items. The author assumed it was their to sell, but the roommate felt it should be shared because it was in the house. The key issue here is communication and prior agreement. Since there was no agreement about how to handle unexpected deliveries, the author might have acted in good faith but without considering others' perspectives.\n\nIn terms of ethical obligation, even if the author believed they owned the second TV, the roommates might feel that since the purchase was for shared use and the TV was delivered to their shared address, they should have a say. The author didn't consider this, leading to the conflict. So, maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not discussing the second TV with everyone, even if they thought it was theirs.\n\nBut then again, the original agreement was only about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author might have been within their rights to take it, especially since it was their name on the order. However, since the house is shared, maybe the delivery was a mistake that could have been addressed collectively. The author didn't check with the roommates, which could be seen as a mistake.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did fail to communicate and consider their roommates' potential claims over the second TV. Since the roommates were involved in the original purchase and the TV was delivered to their shared home, the author should have discussed the second TV with everyone before selling it. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not considering the roommates' expectations, even if they believed they had the right.\n"
