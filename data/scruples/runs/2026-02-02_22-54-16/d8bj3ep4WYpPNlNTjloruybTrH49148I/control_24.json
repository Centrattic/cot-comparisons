We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident. The main points are:\n\n1. They moved in with roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost.\n2. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, which had a discount.\n3. Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but similar.\n4. The author decided to sell the second TV, and a roommate tried to buy it but was refused.\n5. The author eventually sold it to someone else, and the roommate got angry, demanding a cut of the money.\n\nThe key here is whether the roommates had a right to the second TV. Since the original TV was bought together and split the cost, maybe there's an assumption that any additional items from the same order would be shared? But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author didn't order it, but it was delivered. \n\nThe author thought they could claim it because their name was on the order. However, since the original purchase was a joint decision, maybe the roommates expected any unexpected items to be shared as well. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which might have been the issue. The roommate who got angry felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, even though the second TV was a mistake.\n\nSo, the author might have made a mistake by assuming they could keep the second TV without discussing it. Even though it was under their name, the context of shared purchase could imply shared ownership of any unexpected items. The author's action of selling it without consulting others led to conflict. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering their roommates' expectations, even if they didn't think the roommates were entitled to it. Answer A.\n"
