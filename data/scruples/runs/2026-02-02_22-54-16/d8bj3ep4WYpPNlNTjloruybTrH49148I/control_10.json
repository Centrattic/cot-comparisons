We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. So the situation is that they bought a TV with roommates, split the cost three ways. The original TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon accidentally delivered another identical TV (different brand but same features). They thought it was theirs, proposed selling it, and eventually sold it to a third party. One roommate was upset and demanded her cut, while the other didn't mind.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is whether the author is entitled to the second TV. Since they ordered the first one under their Prime, maybe the second one was a mistake from Amazon. But they split the cost with two roommates, so the original purchase was a shared expense. The second TV might be a duplicate, but was it actually theirs? Or was it someone else's mistake?\n\nWait, the author says the second TV was a different brand but identical in features. That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a different brand but same model? Or maybe it's a different product entirely that was mistakenly sent. The key is that they received two TVs, but only ordered one. The first one was paid for by splitting the cost. The second one's ownership is unclear.\n\nThe author thought they could sell the second TV because they believed it was theirs. But the roommate argued that she was entitled to a portion of the proceeds. The other roommate didn't have a problem. The crux is about the ownership of the second TV. If the original purchase was split, does the second one also belong to all three? Or is it the author's because it was delivered to their name?\n\nIn many cases, when multiple people split a purchase, any additional items received by the same order might be considered part of the shared purchase. But since the second TV was a mistake by Amazon, maybe it's separate. However, the author might have been responsible for the order, so perhaps they should have checked if the second one was actually part of their purchase. If they accepted it without verifying, maybe they're responsible. But if it's a genuine mistake by the seller, the author might have the right to keep the proceeds.\n\nAlso, the author's intentions: they thought selling it was the right thing and didn't consider the roommates. The roommate felt entitled because they split the original cost, so maybe they felt the second TV was part of the shared purchase. The author didn't think of that. But if the second TV wasn't part of the original order, perhaps the author isn't obligated to split the profit. However, the fact that the cost was split might imply that any additional items from the same order are also shared. The author might have been wrong in assuming the second TV was theirs to sell without consulting the roommates. Even if the second TV was a mistake, if the original purchase was a joint effort, maybe the mistake should be shared as well. The author could have kept the second one for themselves, but since the original was a shared expense, maybe the mistake is a shared gain. So, if they sold the second TV, they might be obligated to split the proceeds. The author didn't do that, leading the roommate to be upset. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not considering that the second TV was part of the shared purchase. The roommate who tried to buy it was making offers, but the author didn't consult the others. The author's decision to sell it without input could be seen as selfish, even if they thought it was theirs. The ethical obligation here is a bit tricky. If the second TV was a result of the original shared order, then the profit might be considered shared. But if the second TV was a separate mistake, maybe the author can keep the proceeds. However, the author didn't check with the roommates, so transparency could be an issue. The roommate's reaction is based on feeling entitled due to shared expenses. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the second TV was part of the original order. If it wasn't, and it was a mistake, the author could keep it. But since the original purchase was a joint effort, maybe the mistake should be shared. The author didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the second TV's ownership with the roommates before selling it. Even if they thought it was theirs, the shared context might imply shared ownership. So the answer is A.\n"
