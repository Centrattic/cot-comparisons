We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates and a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The main issue seems to be about ownership of the second TV and the sale proceeds.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So even though the author paid for it, the initial agreement was to split costs and profits from selling later. The second TV arrived by mistake. The author sold it, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money. The other roommate isn't a problem.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Second TV**: Since the second TV was a mistake by Amazon, the author might not have had any claim to it. However, the fact that it was delivered under their name could imply some responsibility. But the original purchase was shared, so maybe the second one is also a shared issue?\n\n2. **Agreement with Roommates**: The author and roommates had an agreement about splitting costs and profits from the original TV. The second TV's ownership wasn't discussed. The author assumed they could sell it, but the roommate felt entitled because of the shared cost.\n\n3. **Actions Taken**: The author sold the second TV and didn't share the proceeds. The other roommate didn't mind, but one was upset. The author didn't consider the other roommate's claim, which might be where the conflict arises.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. If the second TV was a mistake, maybe the correct procedure would be to return it as an error. But since the author kept and sold it, there's a possibility that the roommates should have a share since the original purchase was shared. However, the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share the profits. Alternatively, since the purchase was split, maybe the roommates have a claim to the second one as well, especially if the delivery error was Amazon's fault.\n\nThe roommate's anger might stem from feeling that the second TV was part of their shared purchase. The author might not have considered that the shared cost of the first TV could imply shared ownership of any accidental duplicates. However, the original agreement was about the first TV. The second one wasn't part of that agreement. The author might have the right to sell it since they ordered it under their account, but the roommates might feel entitled because of the shared cost. It's a bit ambiguous. The answer hinges on whether the shared cost extends to accidental duplicates. If the roommates contributed to the first TV's cost, maybe they should share in the second one's benefits if it's a result of the same purchase (even if accidental). However, if the second TV was a mistake, it's unclear if the roommates should have a claim. The author might not be in the wrong because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, but there's a lack of communication here. The author didn't consider the roommates' feelings, which could be a gray area. But legally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it might depend on the roommates' expectations.\n"
