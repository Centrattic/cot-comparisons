We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice, and the person claimed the second one as their own, sold it, and now a roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. The agreement was to sell the TV when they move and split the profits. Then, Amazon sent a second TV. The author thought they could sell it because it was \"theirs,\" but the roommate felt entitled to a share.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about ownership and the initial agreement. The TV was ordered by the author but paid for by all three roommates. So even though it was under the author's account, the cost was shared. The second TV is a mistake, but since the original was a shared purchase, maybe the second one should also be considered communal? \n\nThe author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, which led to conflict. The roommate who tried to buy it was turned down, and then the author sold it to someone else. The other roommate had no issues. The question is whether the author was wrong to claim the second TV as their own.\n\nOwnership of the original TV was split, so the second TV might also be part of that shared agreement. The author might have assumed they owned it because it was under their name, but since the purchase was a group decision, maybe the second TV is also part of that shared property. Therefore, selling it without splitting the proceeds could be wrong. \n\nBut there's ambiguity. The author might not have considered that the second TV was a mistake and thus not their responsibility. However, the initial agreement might imply that any additional items from that purchase are shared. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled, but the roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original cost. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision to sell without consulting might have been the issue. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the second TV was part of a shared purchase, and the author should have discussed it with the roommates before selling.\n"
