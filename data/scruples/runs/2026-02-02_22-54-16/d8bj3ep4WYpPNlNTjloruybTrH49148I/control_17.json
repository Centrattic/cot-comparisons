We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The main person ordered it using their Amazon Prime because it was discounted. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one is the same model but a different brand. \n\nThe person thought since they ordered it under their Amazon, the second TV was theirs. They tried to sell it and another roommate kept offering money, but they turned her down. Eventually, they sold it to someone else, and the roommate got angry, demanding her share. The other roommate didn't care.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The original TV was ordered under the AITA's Amazon, but the cost was split. 2) The second TV came as a mistake. 3) The AITA sold the second TV, thinking it was theirs. The roommate argued she's entitled to a share.\n\nNow, the question is whether the AITA is in the wrong. Let's consider a few angles. First, when they bought the first TV together, the cost was split, so maybe the ownership was shared from the start. But the AITA ordered it under their name. However, the second TV was a mistake by the seller. The AITA might think since it was a duplicate sent to their address, they can claim it. But since the cost was split for the original TV, maybe the mistake was due to the shared account or address? Wait, the AITA ordered it under their Amazon, so maybe the seller confused the order? \n\nIf the second TV was a mistake, then technically it might belong to the person who received it. But if the order was placed using the shared address (since they live together), maybe the seller intended to send one TV but sent two. But the AITA took the second one and sold it. The roommate's issue is that since the original cost was split, she feels entitled to a share of the second TV's sale. But was the second TV also a result of the shared purchase? Or was it a mistake that the AITA's order caused?\n\nWait, the original TV was ordered under the AITA's Amazon, but the cost was split. So maybe the AITA had the authority to make the purchase, but the ownership was shared. The second TV being a mistake might have been a result of the order made by the AITA. So maybe the mistake was on the AITA's account, leading to an extra TV delivered to the shared address. Therefore, the second TV's ownership isn't clear. \n\nThe AITA might argue that since it was delivered to their address and under their order, it's theirs. However, the roommate might argue that since the purchase was a joint decision, the mistake affects the group. So, the second TV's ownership is ambiguous. The AITA sold it without discussing with the roommates, which might have been the issue. Even if they thought it was theirs, not consulting the others could be a problem. \n\nThe roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. The agreement was to split profits when moving out, but this was a free TV. The AITA might not have considered that the mistake was due to the original purchase, which was a shared expense. So maybe the roommates have a claim to the second TV as well. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if legally the AITA might have a claim, ethically, not discussing the second TV with roommates could be seen as wrong, especially since they were part of the original purchase. The AITA might have made an assumption that the second TV was solely theirs without considering the shared context of the original purchase. \n\nSo, the answer would be AITA is in the wrong (A) because they didn't consider that the second TV might be a shared asset due to the original joint purchase, even if ordered under their account. The roommates have a valid claim to a share since the mistake might have been tied to the group's purchase decision.\n"
