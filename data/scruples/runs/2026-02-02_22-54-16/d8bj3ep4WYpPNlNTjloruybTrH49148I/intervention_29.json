We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was from a different brand but same specs. The author proposed selling the second TV, and after some back and forth, they sold it. One roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, offers were declined, and eventually the author sold it. The angry roommate claims she's entitled to a share of the money because the original cost was split three ways. The author didn't think they were entitled to the extra TV's proceeds.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: The original TV was bought by all three, split the cost. The second TV was an accident by Amazon. The author ordered it under their Amazon, but the cost was split. Now, the question is whether the second TV belongs to the author or is a joint purchase. \n\nWait, but the original purchase was made by the author, but the cost was split. So maybe the intention was that the TV was a shared purchase. However, the second TV was an error. Since the author's name was on the order, maybe Amazon sent an extra. The author might have a claim to the second one because it was their account. But the roommates might argue that since they were part of the original purchase, they have a right to the second one as well. \n\nBut the author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates before selling it. The angry roommate tried to buy it from the author but was turned down. Then the author sold it. The roommate felt entitled to a share of the proceeds. \n\nSo the main issue is ownership of the second TV. If the original purchase was a joint one, even though ordered by the author, maybe the second TV is also joint property? But since the second TV was an error, perhaps the author is the rightful owner because it was their account. \n\nBut the problem is the cost was split three ways. So maybe the roommates paid part of the original cost, expecting that the TV was for all three. The second TV, being a mistake, might have been a result of the original order. If the original order was paid by the author's account but with contributions from others, then the second TV might be considered an overage for all involved. \n\nHowever, the author ordered the second TV under their own account, so maybe they have the right to it. But the roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim. \n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates when selling the second TV. The main question is whether the second TV was part of the joint purchase or a separate item. If the second TV was a mistake, perhaps it's the author's responsibility to handle it, but since they were using their Amazon account, maybe it's their property. \n\nThe roommates might feel entitled because they paid part of the original cost, but the second TV wasn't part of their agreement. The author's reasoning is that the second TV was an error, and they took the initiative to sell it. But by not consulting the roommates, maybe they should have considered their contributions. \n\nAlternatively, since the original TV was a joint purchase, the second TV might also be considered part of that shared purchase, especially since the cost was split. The author might have a responsibility to share the proceeds. But the author didn't think of it that way. \n\nIn the end, the author sold the TV without consulting the roommates. The angry roommate is upset because she tried to buy it from the author but was refused. The other roommate had no issues. So the problem is between the author and one roommate. \n\nThe author argues that the TV was theirs because it was their account and they didn't see the entitlement. The roommate argues that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the second TV was part of the same order paid by the author's account, maybe they have the right to it. However, since the cost was split for the original TV, maybe the second TV is a windfall that should be shared. But the author didn't consider that. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the second TV was their property, but they could have handled it better by discussing with roommates. However, the way the author acted (selling it without considering the roommates' feelings) might have been careless, even if not necessarily wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the second TV is considered part of the joint purchase. If the original purchase was a joint one even though ordered by the author, then the second TV might also be joint. But if the author's account was the only one used, maybe it's theirs. The author's decision to sell it without consultation could be seen as not considering the roommates' contributions, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating, but not entirely wrong if they believed it was their property. The roommates' expectations might not have been clear. It's a tricky situation. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Given that the author ordered it under their account and the second TV was an error, perhaps it's their property, so B (not in the wrong). However, the roommates' contributions might complicate that. But the original agreement was to split the cost, not necessarily the windfall. The author might not be in the wrong for claiming the second TV as their own, especially since it was their account. So answer B.\n"
