We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house, which they bought under their Amazon account.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates split the cost of a TV ordered through the author's Amazon Prime. They agreed that when moving out, they'd sell the original TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered a second TV, identical in features but a different brand. The author proposed selling the second TV, and after some back and forth, sold it. One roommate got upset and demanded a share of the money.\n\nKey points: The original TV was ordered under the author's account, and the second one came by accident. The roommates didn't need another TV, so the author sold it. The main issue is whether the author should have shared the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates.\n\nThe author argues that since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement and was their own purchase (as it was under their Amazon), they weren't obligated to share. The roommate, however, felt entitled because they had split the cost of the original TV.\n\nLegally, if the second TV was a mistake by the seller, ownership might still belong to the author since it was delivered to their address under their account. However, ethically, sharing the windfall might be expected in a shared living situation. The original agreement was about the first TV, so the second might not be covered. The author didn't ask for the second TV, but by selling it without sharing, they might have caused resentment.\n\nBut the author didn't take any money from the original TV beyond their share. The second TV was a bonus. The roommate's insistence on a share could be seen as unreasonable if there was no prior agreement about unexpected items. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a gray area. The main issue is whether the roommates had a right to the second TV's proceeds when there was no agreement about such a scenario. The answer likely depends on the existing agreements and the nature of shared purchases.\n"
