We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a second TV being delivered accidentally when they ordered one, and then the person sold it without splitting the profit with their roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, even though the cost was split three ways with the roommates. The second TV was a free bonus, so it wasn't part of the original purchase. The author decided to sell the second TV, and one roommate was upset about not getting a share of the money, while the other was okay.\n\nThe key points here are: the original agreement was that when they move out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV was an unexpected extra. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled to a share of the second TV's sale because it wasn't part of the original purchase. The roommate who was trying to buy it thought it belonged to the author, and after it was sold, she got angry about not getting any money.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author had a right to keep the profit from the second TV. The original purchase was split three ways, but the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author ordered it under their own account, so maybe they had the right to handle the second one as their own. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so expecting them to share the profit might not be fair. The author didn't lie; they just assumed that since it was their name on the order, it was their property. The other roommate wasn't upset, which might indicate that the issue was only with one person. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates first. The original agreement was about the first TV, but the second one wasn't part of that. The author might have made a mistake by not communicating, but the fact that it was a free TV and not part of their purchase could mean they're not in the wrong. The roommate's anger over not getting a share seems unreasonable since they didn't pay for the second TV. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
