We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, which accidentally resulted in two TVs. The author sold the second TV and kept the money, leading to a conflict with one roommate who felt entitled to a share. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was purchased under the author's Amazon account, with the cost split three ways. The delivery mistake gave them an extra TV. The author decided to sell the second one, and when the roommate tried to buy it but was rejected, the author sold it to someone else. The roommate then got angry about not getting a share of the money.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in keeping the money from the second TV. Let me think about the factors here. The original purchase was the author's responsibility, and they ordered it under their account. The second TV was an error, not an intentional purchase. The author shared the initial cost with roommates, but the extra TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The agreement was about the first TV's profits upon selling, but the second TV wasn't discussed. \n\nThe author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates initially, which might be a point against them. However, since the second TV came as a mistake, the author might have felt it was their property to decide what to do with. The roommate who got angry felt entitled because they split the original cost, but the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. \n\nThe other roommate didn't have an issue, which suggests that there might not be a consensus among the roommates. The author's reasoning is that the second TV was their property since it was under their name, and they didn't owe the roommates a share. The roommate's reaction seems to stem from expecting a split based on the initial purchase, but the second TV was an unexpected bonus. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, since the original agreement was about the first TV, the second TV's ownership isn't covered. Legally, if the package was addressed to the author, they might have the right to it. Ethically, it's more gray. The roommate's expectation might be based on splitting expenses, but the second TV wasn't part of that. The author might have been negligent in not discussing the second TV with the roommates, but if the roommate approached the author specifically about buying it, the author could argue it was their decision to sell to someone else. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mistake was Amazon's, and the author acted on their own property. The roommate's entitlement might be unfounded since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The key is whether the roommates had an understanding about unexpected purchases. Since they didn't, the author's action might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
