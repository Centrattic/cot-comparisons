We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a package that was delivered by mistake and then selling it. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person moved into a house with two roommates. They agreed to buy a TV together, split the cost three ways, and later sell it when they move out. The person ordered the TV under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one, a different brand but same specs, was sold by the author. One roommate wanted to buy it, got turned down, and when the TV was sold, she got angry and wanted her share of the money. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled to the second TV's proceeds.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the original TV purchase was shared, but the second TV was an accident. The author took the second one as their own. The question is whether they should have split the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The original purchase was a joint agreement, but the second TV was an error. The author might have thought since the second TV came under their name, it's theirs. But maybe the roommates expected that any extra items resulting from the purchase would be shared. The problem is that the initial agreement was about the original TV, not the second one. However, since the original purchase was shared, maybe there's an implicit agreement that any additional benefits from that purchase would be shared as well. But since it was an error, maybe the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nWait, but the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. Amazon made a mistake and sent an extra one. The author didn't ask for it. So in that case, the author might have the right to claim it since it was delivered under their account. But the roommates might argue that since the purchase was a shared expense, the error should be handled collectively. However, the original agreement was about the original TV, not the second. The author didn't intend to get an extra TV, so maybe they're not in the wrong for keeping the proceeds. \n\nBut then again, maybe the roommates feel that since they contributed to the initial purchase, any accidental benefits should be split. However, the author didn't do anything wrong to cause the second TV. It was a mistake. So if the author sold the TV, which they received due to someone else's error, they might not be obligated to share the proceeds. \n\nI think the answer depends on the initial agreement. The roommates agreed to split the cost of the TV, but there's no mention of discussing what to do with any unexpected items. The author acted in good faith, thinking the second TV was their own since it was under their name. The roommate's anger comes from feeling entitled to a share, but maybe there's no explicit agreement for that. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
