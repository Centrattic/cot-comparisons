We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault here. Let's go through the details.\n\nSo, the person moved in with two roommates. They agreed to buy a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime and they split the cost. Then, when delivered, there were two TVs. The second one was different in brand but same specs. The person decided to sell the second TV, thinking it was theirs. The roommate kept trying to buy it from them, but they turned down offers, then eventually sold it to someone else. When the other roommate found out, she got angry and demanded her share of the money. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds from the second TV.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the person's Amazon account. They split the cost with roommates. The second TV was an error by Amazon. Now, the key question is whether the second TV belongs to the author or if it's a shared item since the original purchase was a joint effort.\n\nThe author might argue that since the order was placed under their name, the error is Amazon's, and they had the right to handle the second TV. But the roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, any additional item resulting from that order is a shared asset. The roommates could see the second TV as part of the joint purchase, hence they should share the proceeds.\n\nBut the author didn't mention discussing ownership of the second TV. They might have assumed it was theirs because the order was under their name. However, since the initial purchase was a joint effort, the second TV might be considered a joint asset too. The author didn't consult with the roommates about the second TV, so they might have acted unilaterally. The fact that one roommate was trying to buy it suggests she thought it was the group's property. The author might be wrong for not considering that and selling it without agreement.\n\nAlso, the original agreement was to split costs and profits when they move out. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, but since it was a result of the same purchase, maybe the proceeds should be shared. The author didn't share, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author may be at fault for not discussing the second TV with roommates and for not sharing the proceeds since the original purchase was a joint one. Even though the order was under their name, the contribution from roommates might make the second TV a shared asset.\n"
