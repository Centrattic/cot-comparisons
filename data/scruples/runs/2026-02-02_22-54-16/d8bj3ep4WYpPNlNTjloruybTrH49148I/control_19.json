We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them buying a TV with roommates, splitting the cost, and then receiving an extra TV by mistake. They sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, and now one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main question is whether the author (the person asking) did something wrong. Let's look at the facts. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. They agreed that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split profits. Then, Amazon accidentally sent two TVs. The author assumed the second one was theirs because it was under their account, sold it, and didn't give the money to the roommate who wanted it. The roommate felt entitled to a share, but the author didn't think they were.\n\nSo, the core issue is ownership of the second TV. The original TV was a joint purchase, so maybe the second one, being an error, could be considered joint property too? But the author ordered it under their name. However, since the cost was split, maybe the roommates have a claim. Also, the error might mean the second TV wasn't actually intended for the author, so perhaps there's a responsibility to return it or split proceeds.\n\nThe author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. Even though they paid for the original TV, the error resulted in an unexpected second item. If the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a shared ownership of the error? If the error was Amazon's, the responsibility might lie in returning the item. The author sold it without checking, which could be an issue.\n\nThe roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a portion. The author's defense is that the original TV was bought under their name, so the second one was theirs. But the joint purchase complicates things. Even if the order was under one person's account, the shared cost might imply shared ownership of any errors. Also, the author didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV, which could be a mistake.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, even if the author didn't think the roommates were entitled, they might have a moral obligation to split the proceeds since the error was an accidental gain. The roommates contributed to the original purchase, so the error's benefit might be considered shared. The author's decision to sell without consulting could be seen as disregarding their roommates' interests.\n\nSo, possible answer: The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the shared nature of the original purchase and the accidental gain, leading to a conflict. Therefore, answer A.\n"
