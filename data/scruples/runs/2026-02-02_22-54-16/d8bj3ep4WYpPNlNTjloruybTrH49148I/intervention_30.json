We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they bought a TV with two roommates, splitting the cost three ways. They ordered it through their Amazon Prime because there was a discount. Then Amazon delivered two TVs, which they didn't expect. The author assumed the second one was theirs and sold it, not giving any money to the other roommate who kept trying to buy it from them. The roommate got angry and felt entitled to a cut.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They said they agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits three ways. But the second TV was an accidental delivery. The author thought it was theirs to sell because their name was on the order, but the roommate argued she should get a portion. \n\nThe key points are: ownership of the TV, the agreement regarding shared purchases, and the entitlement to the extra TV. The original TV was paid for by all three, so the author used their Prime account to get a discount. The extra TV might have been an error, like a duplicate shipment. The author sold the second TV, and the roommate is upset because she felt she should have her share of the proceeds. \n\nOwnership of the second TV is unclear. Since the author ordered it under their name, but the cost was split, maybe the TV itself is considered a joint purchase. However, the second TV might not have been part of their original agreement. If the original order was for one TV split costs, the second one was an unexpected item. The author might have assumed they were the owner of the second TV since it was under their account, but if the order was accidental, maybe the second TV doesn't belong to them. \n\nBut the author didn't know it was a mistake. They just saw their name on it and thought it was theirs. They tried to sell it and didn't consider the roommates. The problem is that the other roommate was trying to buy it, which the author didn't accept. The author gave it away, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author might think they did a nice thing by getting the second TV and selling it. But if the original purchase was a joint one, maybe the second TV is also a joint asset. Even if it was a mistake, the roommates might have a claim since the initial payment was shared. The author didn't check if the second TV was part of the same order or a mistake. They just assumed ownership and sold it, not consulting the others. \n\nHowever, the other roommate was trying to buy it from them, and the author rejected the offers. The other roommate felt entitled, but the author didn't think so. The ethical obligation here is tricky. If the second TV was a mistake, maybe it's the author's to handle, but if the original purchase was a shared expense, then the second TV might also be a shared asset. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because they didn't verify the ownership of the second TV. Since the initial purchase was a joint one, even if they ordered it under their name, the second TV could be considered part of that same order, hence a mistake by Amazon. Therefore, the roommates might have a claim to the extra TV as well. The author should have discussed with everyone before selling it, even if they thought it was theirs. Not splitting the proceeds from the second TV when it was likely a mistake could mean they kept something that was collectively owned, which is unfair. \n\nBut wait, the original agreement was about selling the TV when moving out. The second TV was a separate item. If it was a mistake, maybe it's the author's to handle. However, since the initial payment was split, maybe the second TV is also a joint asset. The author didn't clarify if the second TV was a result of the same purchase, so they might have overstepped by selling it without consulting everyone. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The author's intention was good, but not considering the others' possible claims might be the problem. The answer probably depends on whether the second TV was part of the original order. If it's a mistake, and the author didn't know, they might not be responsible. But if the original order was for one TV, the second one is probably an error, and the author should have returned it or shared the proceeds. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't take into account that the roommates had a shared interest in the original purchase, and the second TV could be considered part of that. Therefore, splitting the money from the second TV would be fair. Answer A.\n"
