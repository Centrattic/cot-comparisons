We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV ordered under their Amazon account, split cost among roommates, and a second TV delivered by accident. The author sold the second TV and faced backlash from one roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was purchased through the author's Amazon Prime with a discount. The roommates agreed to split the cost and profits from selling if they move out. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one is identical in features but a different brand. The author decided to sell it, and after some back and forth, sold it to a third party. One roommate got upset and demanded a share of the money, while the other didn't.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to claim the second TV as their own. Since the original purchase was made under their name and Amazon account, maybe they have a claim. But the cost was split among three people. So, does splitting the cost mean shared ownership of any additional items that came from that purchase?\n\nThe author thought selling the second TV was their right, but the other roommate believed she was entitled to a portion. The question is about ownership. If the second TV was an error by the seller, does the recipient have sole ownership, or does splitting the cost of the original purchase imply shared ownership of any additional items?\n\nAlso, the roommates agreed that when they move out, they would split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might argue that since the second TV came as an accident, it's their property because it was delivered to their address. However, since the purchase was a shared expense, maybe there's a shared expectation in the additional item.\n\nBut legally, if the TV was delivered to the address and the order was placed in the author's name, ownership might default to them. However, in a shared living situation, expectations and agreements can complicate things. The author didn't consider the roommates' potential entitlement to the second TV, which might have been an oversight.\n\nHowever, the original agreement was about the first TV. The second one wasn't part of that agreement. The author didn't ask the roommates about the second TV, assuming it was theirs to handle. But since the cost was split, maybe there was an implicit understanding that any additional items would also be shared. The roommates might have felt that since they contributed to the original purchase, they had a claim to the second TV as well.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting the roommates about the second TV, even though it was under their name. The fact that they didn't consider the roommates' entitlement shows a lack of communication, which could be a point against them. However, the TV was delivered to their address under their account, so there's a case for sole ownership. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the shared cost implies shared ownership of any related items, including accidental ones.\n"
