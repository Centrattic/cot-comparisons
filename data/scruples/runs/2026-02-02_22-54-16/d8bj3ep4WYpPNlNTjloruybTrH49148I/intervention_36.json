We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV, which was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, they received a second TV for free. The author sold the second one, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is ownership of the second TV. The original TV was purchased with a shared cost, but the author ordered it under their own account. The second TV was an accidental delivery. The roommates didn't discuss ownership of the second TV, but the author assumed it was theirs and sold it. The roommate who tried to buy it from the author is now upset.\n\nThe main question is about entitlement to the second TV. Since the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, the roommates might not have agreed on how to handle it. The author's argument is that the TV was delivered under their name, so they felt it was theirs. However, the cost was split three ways for the original purchase, so maybe the second TV's value should be shared?\n\nBut wait, the second TV was a free item due to an error. The original purchase was a shared expense, but the second TV wasn't paid for. If the TV was a mistake, perhaps the ownership isn't clear. The author might not have had the right to sell it without consulting the roommates, especially since the original purchase was a shared expense. Even though the order was under the author's name, the responsibility of the purchase was shared.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to keep the second TV for themselves. They wanted to sell it and didn't consider splitting the proceeds because they thought the second TV was their own. The roommate's frustration comes from feeling entitled to a share of the proceeds. However, if the second TV was an error, maybe the ownership isn't clear, and the author should have discussed it with everyone before selling.\n\nThe other roommate didn't have an issue, so maybe the problem was with just one person. The author might have made a mistake in assuming the second TV was theirs without clarifying. But was there an agreement about the second TV? The original agreement was about splitting the cost of the first TV and splitting profits when selling later. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, as the second TV wasn't part of the original shared purchase. However, since they all benefited from the first TV, the second TV's proceeds might be considered shared property. It's a bit of a grey area, but if the author acted in good faith and thought they had the right, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, since the purchase was shared, the second TV's ownership might be a shared asset. Hmm.\n"
