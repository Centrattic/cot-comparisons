We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, which was split in cost among three roommates. When a second TV was delivered, the author sold it and kept the proceeds, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the original TV was purchased with a shared cost, but the order was placed under the author's account. The second TV was an accident, and the author decided to sell it. The other roommate wanted to buy it but was turned down, and when the author sold it, the roommate got upset and demanded a share of the money.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong in keeping the profits from the second TV. The roommates had agreed that when they moved out, they would split the profits from selling the original TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author argues that since the second TV was delivered under their name (as part of the order they placed), they had the right to sell it. However, the other roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nI need to consider if there was an implicit agreement about the second TV. The original cost was split, so maybe the roommates expected that any additional items related to the purchase (like the second TV) would also be shared. However, since the second TV was an error and not part of the original plan, the author might not have been aware they had to include others. But the author did benefit from the error, and the other roommate might feel that since they contributed to the initial purchase, they have a claim over the second TV.\n\nAlso, the author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. Even though the order was under their name, the TV was bought as a shared purchase. So maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with everyone before selling it. The other roommate's anger stems from feeling that the author unilaterally decided to keep the benefit of the error, which might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initially think the roommates were entitled to it. The original agreement was about the first TV, and the second one was an unexpected free item. If the author sold it without discussing, that might have been a mistake, but it's unclear if there was an agreement about the second TV. \n\nIn terms of ethical obligation, since the cost was split, perhaps the profits from any related items should also be split. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that. The other roommate's entitlement could be based on their contribution to the original purchase, even if the second TV was an error. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't share the proceeds from the second TV, which was part of the same purchase they all contributed to.\n"
