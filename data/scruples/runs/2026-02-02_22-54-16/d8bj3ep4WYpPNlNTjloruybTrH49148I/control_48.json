We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime because it was discounted. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was the same specs but different brand. The author thought they could sell the extra TV, which they did, without giving the money to the roommates. Now, one roommate is upset and demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the TVs. The original TV was bought with a pooled amount where each roommate contributed. But the author placed the order using their Amazon account. That might mean the purchase was made under their name, but since the cost was split, maybe the ownership was shared? However, the second TV was an error by Amazon. The key here is whether the second TV is considered the author's personal property or if it's part of the shared purchase.\n\nThe author thought they were entitled to the second TV because it was their order, but the roommates might argue that since the purchase was a group effort, any errors in the delivery should be addressed collectively. The author sold the TV without consulting the others, which could be seen as not considering their input. Even though the roommate only approached the author, the author didn't involve the other roommate in the decision, which might have been a mistake.\n\nThe question is whether the second TV is the author's to do with as they please. If the purchase was a joint one, even if ordered by one person, the error might affect the entire group's purchase. However, if the error was Amazon's mistake, maybe the second TV was a separate item that belonged to the author. But since the purchase was made with shared funds, the author might have a responsibility to share the benefits of the error with the group.\n\nThe roommate is upset because she thought she was entitled to a portion of the money. The author didn't consider her claim, which might be fair if the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. However, since the purchase was a joint one, the error might be considered a shared gain. The author's decision to sell it without discussing could be seen as acting unilaterally, which might be wrong if the group had a collective interest in the purchase.\n\nAlso, the initial agreement was that when moving out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. The second TV wasn't part of that original agreement. But was the second TV considered an error, making it the author's to handle? If the error was Amazon's, maybe the author has rights to it, but if the purchase was a joint effort, maybe the error benefits the group.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, even though they ordered it. The roommates contributed to the cost, so the error in delivery could be a shared issue. The author's action of selling it without discussion might have disregarded the group's shared interest, even if it was their order.\n"
