We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then sold it. The key points here are about ownership and shared responsibility.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime account, and the cost was split three ways. So the initial purchase was a joint decision, but the order was under one person's account. The second TV was an accidental delivery. The author didn't know about the duplicate until it arrived.\n\nThe roommates agreed to split the cost of the first TV, so they all contributed to that purchase. The second TV, however, wasn't part of that agreement. The author didn't order it, and it was a mistake by Amazon. So the question becomes, who owns the second TV? Since it was delivered to their shared house but addressed to the author's name, does that mean it's his to dispose of?\n\nThe author thought selling it was the right move since they didn't need another TV. The other roommate tried to buy it from the author, thinking it was his. But after the author sold it, the roommate got upset and felt entitled to a share. The other roommate didn't mind.\n\nLegally, since the second TV was sent to the author's address under his account, he might have ownership. The cost wasn't shared for the second TV because it was a mistake. The author didn't agree to share the second TV, so he had the right to sell it. The other roommate's frustration comes from thinking it was a joint purchase, but the author didn't intend that. The author might have been clear about ownership from the start, but the roommate's actions (asking to buy it) show they acknowledged it as the author's.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
