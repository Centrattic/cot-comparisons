We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author bought the TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost with two roommates, and then when a second one arrived, sold it without splitting the profit. The roommate who tried to buy it got upset and now claims they're entitled to a share.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original purchase was made by the author using their Amazon, but they agreed to split the cost with roommates. So the initial TV was a shared purchase. The second TV was an error, and the author took it as their own. The problem is whether the second TV belongs to the author or if it's shared.\n\nThe author argues that since the second TV wasn't part of their original agreement and they didn't expect to get it, they had the right to sell it. The roommate who tried to buy it felt entitled because they thought it was part of the shared purchase. The other roommate didn't have issues.\n\nLegally, if the second TV was an error, it might belong to the person whose name was on the order. Since the author ordered it under their Amazon, maybe they have a claim. But ethically, when they split the cost for the first TV, maybe the second one should be treated as shared property too? Or is the second TV entirely the author's since it was an accident?\n\nThe roommates might have assumed that any additional items from the order would be shared since they split the cost of the first. The author didn't clarify that the second TV was a mistake and took ownership without discussing. That could be the issue. Even though the author didn't intend to keep the money, the fact that they didn't consider sharing the profit from the second TV might be seen as selfish.\n\nBut on the other hand, the second TV wasn't part of their agreement. The author didn't ask for it, so they might not owe the roommates anything. The roommate who was trying to buy it approached the author, thinking it was theirs, which the author accepted. If the author sold it to someone else without consulting, maybe they should have considered splitting the profit, especially since the roommates contributed to the original purchase.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the second TV was their own to handle, but if the roommates contributed to the original cost, perhaps they have a claim to any unexpected gains from the order. It's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't consider that the second TV might be a shared asset, but maybe they should have. The main issue is whether the second TV's value is part of the shared agreement. If the error was Amazon's, the author might have a right to it, but ethically, maybe they should have discussed with roommates first.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase. Since the original purchase was split, but the second TV was an error, the author might have acted in good faith but could be seen as not considering their roommates' interests. Therefore, maybe the author is somewhat in the wrong for not discussing the second TV's ownership and profits.\n"
