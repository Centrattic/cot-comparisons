We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the person moved into a house with two roommates. They bought a TV together, split the cost three ways. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second was a different brand but same features. The author thought it was theirs, proposed selling it, and ended up selling it without splitting the profit. One roommate got upset and demanded her share, while the other didn't mind.\n\nThe key points here are: the original TV was purchased by the author under their account, but the cost was split. The second TV was an error by Amazon. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV and sold it, keeping the money. The upset roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nNow, the author argues that since the second TV was a free bonus and the original was under their name, they had the right to keep it. The roommate, however, argues that since they paid a third of the original cost, they should share in the proceeds of the second TV.\n\nHmm. Legally, maybe the author is right because the second TV was a mistake, and they were the one who received it. But ethically, since they were splitting costs for the first TV, maybe the roommates expected any bonuses to be shared. The author didn't consider the roommates' contributions when claiming the second TV. Even though the second TV was a free item, the initial purchase was a shared expense. If the roommates had known about the second TV, perhaps they would have wanted to split the profit or use it collectively. By selling it without consulting the roommates, the author might have acted selfishly, even if they didn't think the roommates were entitled to it. The roommate's reaction is based on a sense of shared ownership or contribution, which the author might have overlooked. So, even though the author didn't intend to take the money, the action of not sharing the profit could be seen as wrong because of the shared initial expense.\n"
