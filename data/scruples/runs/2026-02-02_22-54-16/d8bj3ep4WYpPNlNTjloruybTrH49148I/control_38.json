We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. When a second TV arrived, the author sold it, and one roommate got upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon, but the cost was split equally. The second TV was an error, and the author decided to sell it. The roommate who tried to buy it from the author is now upset because they think they should get a portion of the sale. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong in keeping the profit from the second TV. Let's consider ownership. The original TV was purchased by the author, but the cost was shared. However, the second TV was a mistake by the seller. Since the author's name was on the order, they might have a claim to the second TV. But since the cost was split, maybe the roommates have a claim too?\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways. So even though the author paid with their Amazon, they each contributed a third. The second TV was an error. The author took ownership and sold it. The other roommate felt entitled because they split the cost. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The original agreement was about the first TV. The second one was an unexpected free item.\n\nSo the author probably thought the second TV was their own since it was under their name. They didn't mention the second TV to the roommates, just sold it. The problem is whether the roommates have any claim to the second TV since they contributed to the original purchase. But the original purchase was for one TV. The second TV was an error, so maybe the author has a right to it. However, since the cost was split, maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since they split the cost, they have a claim to the second TV's profit. But the original purchase was for one TV. The error resulted in an extra TV. The author might have the legal/ethical right to the second TV because it was delivered to their name. However, since the roommates were part of the original purchase, maybe they should have been considered. The author didn't consider them, leading to conflict.\n\nThe other roommate didn't mind, but one was upset. The author's reasoning was that they didn't think the roommates were entitled to the money. But since they were part of the original purchase, maybe there's an unspoken agreement that any profits from the TV (including the second one) should be split? Or is the second TV entirely the author's because it was a mistake and under their name?\n\nI think the key here is that the second TV was an error. The original purchase was split three ways, but the second TV wasn't part of that. The author might have a claim to the second TV because it was delivered to their account. However, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they should have been included in the decision. The author's failure to communicate and the fact that one roommate felt entitled could mean the author should have split the profit. But the author didn't think that way. So, were they in the wrong for not considering the roommates' feelings?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, even though the original purchase was shared, they might be in the wrong. The roommates might have expected that any additional value from the purchase (like an error TV) would be shared. The author's decision to keep all the profit without discussion could be seen as selfish, hence AITA. However, if the second TV was entirely the author's because it was a mistake under their name, then maybe not.\n\nBut the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so they might have a claim to the second TV. The author's reasoning is that the second TV was theirs, but since the original cost was shared, maybe the profit should be shared. Alternatively, since the second TV was a mistake, the author might have to return it or handle it independently. But they sold it, so maybe the profit is their own.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. The author might be in the wrong for not discussing the second TV with the roommates before selling it, especially since the cost was split. The roommate's entitlement could stem from their contribution to the original purchase. So even though the second TV was an error, the fact that the roommates contributed to the original purchase might give them a claim to part of the profit from the second TV. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that.\n"
