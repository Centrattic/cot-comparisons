We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. They ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs by accident. The second one is a different brand but the same specs. The person decided to sell the extra TV, and when they did, one of the roommates got angry and wanted a share of the money. The person didn't think the roommates were entitled to it because the original purchase was under their name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the TVs. The original TV was bought with shared funds, so technically, it's a joint purchase. But the person ordered it under their account. However, since the cost was split, maybe the ownership is shared among all three. Now, the second TV\u2014since it was a mistake by Amazon, does that change ownership? If the delivery was a mistake, maybe the second TV isn't actually owned by them. But the person took possession of it and sold it.\n\nThe problem arises when the roommate who wanted to buy the TV was only approaching the author. The author thought it was their TV to sell. But since the original purchase was a shared decision, maybe the second TV should also be considered joint property. Even though the second TV came as a mistake, if it's the same product, maybe it's part of the original order's mistake. So, if they all contributed to the original purchase, maybe they all have a claim to the second TV as well.\n\nThe author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates. The roommate felt entitled to a portion, which the author didn't agree with. The author's argument is that since they ordered it under their account and the roommate approached them directly, it's their responsibility. But the roommate's argument is that since they all paid for the original TV, they should have a share in the second one too.\n\nLegal perspective: If the second TV was a mistake, the ownership isn't clear. If the original purchase was a joint effort with shared funds, the second TV might be considered joint property as well. Selling it without consulting others could be an issue. However, if the purchase was under the author's account, maybe they have more control. But the fact that the cost was split complicates it.\n\nEthically, even if legally the author could make the claim, ethically, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, they might feel they have a right to the second TV too. The author didn't consider this and sold it, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the roommates' contributions and took ownership without consensus. Even though the purchase was under their name, the shared cost implies shared ownership. The mistake in delivery might mean the second TV wasn't theirs to keep, but they took it and sold it, which could be seen as taking from the shared property. Alternatively, since it was a mistake, maybe they weren't supposed to keep it. But the main conflict is about the roommate's entitlement.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't properly consider the shared ownership aspect of the second TV, leading to the conflict with the roommate. Even though the original TV was split costs, the mistake delivery might have created a situation where the second TV's ownership isn't clear, and selling it without consultation was wrong.\n"
