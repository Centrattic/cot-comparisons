  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're at fault for taking a second TV that was mistakenly delivered to their house. The key points here are the ownership of the original TV and the second one. \n\nFirst, they bought the original TV through their Amazon Prime and split the cost with two roommates. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell it and split the profits. Then, Amazon sent a second TV for free. The user took that and sold it without consulting the roommates, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe main question is whether the second TV belongs to the user or is a shared asset. Since the second TV was an error, it's unclear if it's their property. But the user ordered the original, so maybe they had a claim. However, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, the second one might be considered communal as well.\n\nThe user didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. Even though the original was under their name, the mistake might mean the second TV isn't theirs alone. Selling it without discussing could be seen as selfish. The roommate's reaction is about feeling entitled to a share, which might be valid if they considered the second TV part of their shared purchase.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong for not discussing the second TV's ownership with the roommates before selling it. They should have clarified ownership, especially since it was an error. Not considering the roommates' potential claims could be the issue here.\n"
