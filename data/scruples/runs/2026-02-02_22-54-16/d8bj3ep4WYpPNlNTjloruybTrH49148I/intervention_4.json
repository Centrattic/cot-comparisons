  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for claiming a package that was accidentally delivered to a house shared with roommates that had my name on it?\nSome context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The author decided to sell the second TV and didn't give any money to one of the roommates, who got angry and thought they were entitled to a share.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the original agreement included the second TV. The author mentions they agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split profits. But the second TV was an error. The question is whether that second TV was part of the original purchase. Since it was a mistake, there's no agreement on ownership. The author bought the first TV under their account, so the second one being delivered to their house with their name might be considered their property unless there's an agreement to split it.\n\nThe roommate wanted to buy the second TV from the author, so she thought it was the author's. Then the author sold it without splitting the proceeds. The other roommate had no issue. The problem is, the angry roommate believed she was entitled to a portion. But since the second TV was not part of their original purchase, and the author didn't have an agreement to share the free TV's proceeds, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The error led to an unexpected item, and the author took ownership based on the original order. The roommate's entitlement might be unfounded unless there's a shared ownership agreement for the second TV. Since there's no mention of such an agreement, the author might not be wrong. So answer B.\n"
