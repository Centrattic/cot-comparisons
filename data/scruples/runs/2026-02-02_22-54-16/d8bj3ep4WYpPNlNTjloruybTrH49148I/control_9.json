We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The author bought the TV with their Amazon Prime, split the cost with roommates. Then a second TV arrived. The author considered the second one theirs, sold it, and one roommate got angry about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author had a right to the second TV. The original TV was ordered under their Amazon account, so the first one makes sense. The second one was a mistake by Amazon. Since the author paid for the first, does that mean the second one is their property? Maybe, but maybe the roommate who offered to buy it thought it was shared? \n\nWait, the author mentions that the roommates agreed that when moving out, they'd split the profits from selling the original TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates. The main issue is whether the second TV was a joint purchase or not. Since the author ordered it under their own account, maybe it wasn't part of their shared agreement. \n\nThe roommate who was pushing to buy it thought it was the author's, which the author didn't correct. Then the author sold it without consulting, leading to conflict. The other roommate didn't have a problem. The key point is if the second TV was a mistake and belongs to the author alone. Since it was delivered to the house and the author's name was on the order, maybe it's their property. But the author used the shared house address, so maybe there's a split in ownership? \n\nThe author thought they were doing a nice thing by selling it, but the other roommate felt entitled. If the second TV was a result of a merchant error, the author might have a claim to it. However, if the original purchase was a shared expense, maybe the second TV's value should be shared? But the original purchase was split, but the second was a mistake. The author didn't include the roommates in the decision, which could be the issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the second TV was an error, the author may have a right to it. But if they didn't communicate with roommates and the roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, maybe the author should have shared. Alternatively, since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement, the author might be in the right. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), because the second TV was a mistake and the original purchase was the author's responsibility. However, maybe there's an expectation when roommates split costs that any surplus goes to all. But the author didn't mention the second TV to the roommates, so maybe they had no claim. The roommate's anger might be unfounded. So the answer is B.\n"
