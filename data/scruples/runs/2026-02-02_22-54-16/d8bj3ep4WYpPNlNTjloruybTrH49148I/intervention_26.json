We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the person moved in with two roommates and they all agreed to buy a TV together, splitting the cost. The person ordered it through their Amazon Prime because it was discounted. They had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. \n\nThen, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one is a different brand but same specs. The person assumed the free TV was theirs, maybe because the original order was under their name. They tried to sell it, and one roommate kept offering to buy it but was turned down. Eventually, the person sold it to someone else. The angry roommate then got upset and demanded a cut of the proceeds, thinking she was entitled. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered by the author but paid for by all three roommates. The second TV was an error by Amazon. The author thought it was their own to sell, but the roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nWait, but the second TV was an accident. Amazon sent an extra one. The original purchase was split three ways. If the second TV is considered a windfall or an unexpected gain from Amazon's mistake, does that belong to the person who ordered it, or does the original agreement about splitting costs apply here?\n\nIn the original agreement, they agreed that any profits from selling the TV would be split three ways. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It's an extra item delivered by mistake. The author might argue that the second TV is their own because the error was on Amazon's end, and they didn't intend to order two. But the other roommate might think since they all paid for the original order, the error benefits them all, hence the profits should be split.\n\nHowever, the original purchase was ordered by the author using their Amazon account. If the second TV was a result of the same order, maybe Amazon's mistake was in sending an extra. The author might not be legally or ethically obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV, especially since it wasn't part of the original agreement. But the roommate's argument is that since they contributed to the cost of the original purchase, they should get a share of any windfall from that order.\n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. Legally, if the person ordered the item, they might have ownership rights over the second TV, especially if it's their account. Ethically, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe there's an expectation of shared benefit. But the original agreement was about the TV they bought, not any free items that came as errors. The author didn't intend to order two TVs, so the second one isn't part of their initial purchase.\n\nThe roommate's frustration might stem from not understanding that the second TV is a separate item. The author thought they had the right to sell it as it was under their name. The roommate's entitlement might be based on the initial cost-sharing but not considering the accidental delivery.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They acted based on their understanding of the situation and the original agreement. However, perhaps there was a miscommunication about the ownership of the second TV. If the roommates had agreed that all purchases related to the TV would be shared, even accidental ones, then the author might have an obligation. But since the second TV was an error, it's more the author's property. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
