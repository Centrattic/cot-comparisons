We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV purchase under their Amazon account, shared with roommates, and a second TV being delivered accidentally. The author sold the second TV, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought through the author's Amazon Prime, which they had a discount on. The cost was split three ways, so the roommates contributed their shares. The second TV came as an error, and since it was identical in features but a different brand, maybe it was a mistake in Amazon's order processing. \n\nThe author thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered to their address and their name was on the original order. They proposed selling it, and even though another roommate wanted to buy it, the author sold it to someone else. The key points here are ownership of the original TV and the accidental second one.\n\nSince the original purchase was under the author's account, but the cost was shared, there's a shared ownership aspect. However, the second TV wasn't ordered, so it's unclear if it's the author's to claim. The roommates might argue that since they paid for the original, the error benefits should be split. The author didn't consider that, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut the author might argue that the second TV wasn't ordered by anyone else, and since the original was their order, the mistake was Amazon's. They might feel entitled to the proceeds because they were the ones who handled the order. The other roommate's anger comes from expecting a share, possibly thinking it's a result of their shared contribution. \n\nIn terms of legal ownership, if the second TV was a mistake, it might belong to the person who received it, which was the house. But since they split the costs, maybe the proceeds should be shared. However, the author sold it without consulting, which could be a mistake. But the roommate didn't contribute anything extra for the second TV; the mistake wasn't their fault. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the second TV wasn't their fault, and they handled the sale. However, not discussing it with roommates could be seen as inconsiderate. But the original agreement was to split profits from selling the original TV, not the second one. The second TV was an error, so the author might have a right to keep the proceeds. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled communication better. The main issue is ownership of the mistaken delivery. Since the original was under their name and the second was an error, the author might have a valid claim to the second TV's value.\n"
