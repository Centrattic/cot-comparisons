We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then selling it.\n\nFirst, the context is that they moved in with two roommates, ordered a TV under their Amazon Prime, split the cost, and agreed on splitting the profits when they sell it. The key point here is that the original TV was ordered under their account, and the cost was split. So the ownership of the original TV might be a shared purchase since they all contributed.\n\nBut then, Amazon delivered a second TV. The author thought it was their own, proposed selling it, and eventually sold it. The roommate who wanted to buy it was upset when she found out the money wasn't split. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe main issue is ownership of the second TV. Since it was an error, does the ownership belong to the person whose account was used, or is it shared because they all contributed to the original purchase? The original agreement was about splitting the original TV's cost and future profits, but the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author didn't split the cost of the second TV, so maybe they had the right to claim it. However, since they were roommates, maybe there's an expectation of shared ownership, especially if the error occurred at the house they all share. \n\nBut the original TV was ordered under the author's account, and the second one might have been a result of their order, so maybe the author is the rightful owner of both. However, since the original purchase was split, maybe the second TV should also be considered a shared asset. The roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, leading to the error. But the author didn't split the cost of the second TV, so maybe they aren't obligated to share the proceeds. \n\nThe key is whether the second TV is considered a result of the shared purchase. If the error was due to the initial order split by three, then the second TV might be a shared asset. But since it was delivered to the house and the author's name was on it, maybe it's theirs. The author's roommate's reaction might be unreasonable if the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't agree to split the second TV, and the original agreement only covered the first TV. However, the roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the initial purchase leading to the second TV. \n\nBut since the second TV was an error, perhaps it's the author's to handle as they see fit, especially since it's under their account. The roommate's demand for a share might be based on an incorrect assumption. The author isn't in the wrong because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement and they had the right to sell it without sharing. The answer is B.\n"
