We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake. The main details are that they and two roommates bought a TV together, split the cost, and ordered it under the author's Amazon. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author took the second one, sold it, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon account. The roommates agreed to split the cost, but the purchase was made by the author. The second TV was a free one, possibly a mistake. The author decided to sell it, and the other roommate wanted to buy it but the author didn't accept the offers. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, which upset the roommate who then felt entitled to a portion of the proceeds.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and agreement. Since the original purchase was under the author's account, even though the cost was split, the ownership might be considered the author's because they made the purchase. However, the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, they should have a claim to the second TV as well. But the second TV was a free one that wasn't ordered, so perhaps the author had the right to claim it. The author didn't share the proceeds, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe other roommate (the one who didn't get upset) might have no issues because they weren't involved in the purchase or the negotiation. The problem is between the author and the other roommate. The author's reasoning is that the TV was their name, so they had the right to it. But the roommate argues that since they all paid for the original TV, they should share in the second one's proceeds.\n\nBut legally, if the purchase was under the author's account, the second TV might belong to them. However, ethically, the roommates might expect a share since they contributed to the initial purchase. The author didn't consider splitting the free TV's profits, which is where the roommate's anger comes from.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the second TV was their property to handle. But if the roommates had an agreement that any free items from shared purchases would be split, then the author is in the wrong. Since the original agreement was only about splitting the original TV when selling, the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. So the author is not in the wrong for not sharing the second TV's proceeds. The answer would be B.\n"
