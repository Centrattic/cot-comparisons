We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA) for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The key points here are the purchase setup and the ownership of the second TV.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought using the author's Amazon Prime account, with the cost split three ways. The agreement was that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, the delivery of a second TV happened. The author assumed it was theirs because it was under their account and sold it, giving the money to others only when approached. The other roommate got upset, claiming entitlement to a share.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the second TV, which was an error, should be considered communal property or the author's personal property. Since the original purchase was under the author's account, the second TV might be considered a duplicate under their account, making it their property. However, since the house is shared and the initial purchase was split among roommates, maybe there's an argument that the error benefits all, and they should share it.\n\nBut the author didn't involve the roommates in the decision about the second TV. Even if the original TV was split costs, the second one might be the author's because it was their account. However, the roommates might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim to the error. The author didn't consider their entitlement, which led to conflict. \n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it thought it was the author's, which the author didn't correct. Then, when selling, the author didn't offer the profit to the roommates, leading to the argument. The other roommate had no issues, but the main issue is with the one who felt entitled.\n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the author thought it was their TV, they might have a duty to inform the roommates about the second TV and discuss how to handle it, especially since it was a significant item. The fact that the author didn't consider sharing the profit might be where they went wrong. So, the answer might be A (author is at fault) for not involving roommates in the decision despite the shared living arrangement and initial cost-splitting.\n"
