We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was accidentally delivered twice, split costs, and then the writer sold the second one, leading to a conflict with a roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main points are: the initial purchase was split equally among three roommates, the writer ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The writer decided to sell the second one, and when a roommate tried to buy it but wasn't successful, she got upset and demanded a cut after the writer sold it. The other roommate was okay with it.\n\nThe writer's defense is that the original TV was purchased under their name, and since the roommate approached them directly to buy the second TV, they thought it was theirs. They didn't consider splitting the profit from the second TV because they believed it was their own.\n\nTo determine if the writer is in the wrong, I need to consider the initial agreement. They agreed to split costs and profits when moving out. But the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The writer didn't share the cost of the second TV, so maybe they didn't have to split that profit. However, the issue is whether the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase. If the first TV was a shared purchase because the cost was split, but the second TV was an error, maybe the second one isn't shared. The roommate might argue that since the initial purchase was shared, any duplicates or errors should be considered shared property. However, since the writer ordered it under their Prime, and the duplicate was their own, perhaps they have a claim to it. The roommate's insistence on a cut could be based on a misunderstanding. The writer didn't split the cost of the second TV, so they might not be obligated to share the proceeds. \n\nBut the problem arises from the initial agreement. The roommates agreed that when moving out, profits would be split. However, the second TV wasn't part of the initial purchase. It's an error. The writer might have a right to claim it since it was their order. The roommate's frustration comes from expecting a shared profit, but if the second TV wasn't a shared expense, then the writer isn't in the wrong. Also, the roommate approached the writer directly, indicating she thought it was the writer's. So, the writer isn't obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
