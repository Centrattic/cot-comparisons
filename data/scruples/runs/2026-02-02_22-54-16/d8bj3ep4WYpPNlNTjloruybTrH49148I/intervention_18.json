We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their shared house. The key points are:\n\n1. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime because it was discounted, and they split the cost with two roommates.\n2. An extra TV was delivered, identical in features but a different brand. The author decided to sell it, thinking it was their own.\n3. One roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author turned down offers. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is about ownership. The author ordered it under their account, so legally, it's their property. The roommates split the cost for the original purchase, but the second TV was an error. Since the author didn't ask for it, it's their responsibility to handle it. However, the roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. But the author didn't agree to split the second TV's proceeds. \n\nEthically, maybe the roommates expected a share since they helped pay for the first one. But the author didn't explicitly agree to share the second. The roommate's reaction seems justified if they thought there was an agreement, but the author didn't. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the TV was delivered to the author's account and there was no prior agreement about the second one, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem is communication. The answer is B.\n"
