We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person bought a TV with roommates, splitting the cost three ways. They used their Amazon Prime for the order. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was the same as the first, so they sold it. The roommate who tried to buy it from them got upset and demanded a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was made by the author under their account, even though the cost was split. The key point here is ownership. Since the TV was ordered under their name, even though the cost was shared, the author might have assumed they had control over the TV. However, since the cost was split, maybe there was an agreement that all three had a stake in the original TV. But the second TV was an error by Amazon, so it wasn't part of the original purchase. The author didn't owe the roommates the second TV because it wasn't part of their shared expense. \n\nThe roommate who kept offering to buy the TV thought it was the author's property. The author sold it, and the other roommate is now upset. The author didn't share the profit because they considered the second TV as theirs. The problem arises because the roommates might feel entitled to a share since they contributed to the original purchase. But the second TV was an unexpected error, so maybe the author is within their rights to claim it. However, the fact that they split the cost of the original TV might imply that any additional items from the same order are shared. \n\nWait, but the second TV wasn't part of the original order. The original TV was ordered, and the second was a mistake. So the author's purchase under their name might mean they have ownership of the second TV. The roommates contributed to the original TV's cost, but the second one wasn't their responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong for keeping the second TV, especially since it was an error. However, the roommates might feel that since they helped pay for the original, they should share in any unexpected gains. But legally, if the package is addressed to the author, they can keep it. But ethically, maybe the author should have split the profit since the initial cost was shared. But the author didn't think of it that way. \n\nHmm, there's a conflict between legal ownership and shared responsibility. The author's argument is that the TV was under their name, so they own it. The roommates argue that since they paid part of the original order, they should get a share. But the second TV wasn't part of the original expense. Maybe the author is in the right because the second TV was an error, and they were the one who ordered it. The roommates' contributions were only for the first TV. The author didn't owe them anything from the second TV. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
