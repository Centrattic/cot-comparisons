We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming the second TV and selling it. The situation is that they moved into a house with roommates and bought a TV together, splitting the cost. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The author took the second one, sold it, and the roommate got upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought under the author's Amazon account. They had agreed to split the cost of the first TV. The second TV was an accident, a duplicate. The author thought it was theirs to handle since it was delivered to their house and their name was on the order. But the roommate felt entitled to a portion of the money from selling the second TV.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the second TV. Since the second TV was an error, whose property is it? If the purchase was made under the author's account, then maybe the second TV was also their property. However, since the cost was split, maybe the original purchase wasn't entirely the author's. But the second TV wasn't paid for, so it's an error. The author didn't pay again, so they might have a right to keep it.\n\nBut the roommates might argue that since they shared the cost of the first TV, the second TV is a result of that joint purchase, so they should share in the proceeds. However, the second TV wasn't part of their original agreement. The author didn't ask for the second TV; it was a mistake. So they might not be obligated to share it. \n\nThe author tried to sell it and the roommate kept offering to buy it. The author sold it without the roommate's knowledge. The roommate then got angry. The author didn't think the roommate was entitled to a share. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the second TV was an error, and they weren't responsible for that. They didn't benefit the roommates by keeping the second TV since it wasn't part of their original agreement. The original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV wasn't their responsibility to split. So the answer should be B.\n"
