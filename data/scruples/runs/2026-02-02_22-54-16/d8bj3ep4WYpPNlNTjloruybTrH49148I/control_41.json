We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, which ended up having two TVs delivered. The person who ordered it took the second one and sold it, leading to a conflict with another roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the initial agreement. They split the cost of the TV three ways for the living room. The main TV was ordered under the author's Amazon, and there was a free second TV that came. The author thought they could sell the second one and didn't consider the others' shares. The problem is whether the other roommates had a claim to the second TV.\n\nThe original purchase was for a shared TV, so maybe the second TV is also considered a shared item since the main one was for communal use. Even though the author paid for it initially, since the cost was split, maybe the second TV became a shared asset. However, the second TV was an error by Amazon, so it's unclear if all the roommates intended to purchase a second one. The author might have thought they could keep or sell the second one independently, but the other roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The initial agreement about the first TV. 2) Whether the second TV, which was an accident, falls under the same agreement. 3) How the proceeds from selling the second TV should be divided.\n\nIf the roommates agreed only to split the cost for one TV, then the second one wasn't part of their agreement. But if the second TV was a mistake, maybe it's the author's property to handle since it was delivered to their name. However, since the original TV was for shared use, the second one might also be considered communal property, especially if the error was due to the order being in the author's name but the TV was intended for shared use. \n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it from the author might have thought it was communal, so the author not sharing the proceeds could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. However, if there was no prior agreement about the second TV, the author might not be obligated to share. But maybe there's an implicit understanding that any additional items received due to the original shared purchase should be split equally.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author being at least partially wrong because they didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. Even if they didn't intend to share it, not considering the roommates' possible claims could be seen as selfish. But if the second TV was an error and the roommates weren't involved in purchasing it, maybe the author isn't wrong. The main issue is communication. The author assumed ownership based on the name, but the roommate felt entitled due to the shared cost. The answer depends on whether the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase. If yes, then the author should have split the proceeds. If not, then maybe not. However, since the roommates didn't know about the second TV and it was an error, the author might not be wrong. But the fact that they didn't discuss it with the roommates before selling it probably makes them at least slightly responsible. Maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they should have considered their roommates' contributions and shared the proceeds.\n"
