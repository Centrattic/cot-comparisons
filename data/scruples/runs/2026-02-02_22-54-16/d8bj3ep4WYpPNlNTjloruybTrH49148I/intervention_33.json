We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person moved in with roommates, they all split the cost of a TV ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The author assumed the second one was theirs and sold it, keeping the money. The roommate kept trying to buy it and then got upset when it was sold without her input.\n\nFirst, the original agreement was to split the cost and profits. The key point is whether the second TV was meant for them all or just an error. Since it was delivered to their shared house and had the author's name, it's possible it was a mistake. The author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, which might be the issue. The roommate felt entitled because they split the cost initially. Even though the TV was ordered under the author's account, the initial agreement about splitting profits might extend to any additional items received from that order. The author acted alone without considering the roommates' potential claims, which could be seen as selfish. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But if the second TV was a mistake and the original agreement didn't cover unexpected items, then the author's action is justified (B). The roommate's insistence might be based on a misunderstanding of the agreement. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled, but maybe should have discussed it. Hmm.\n"
