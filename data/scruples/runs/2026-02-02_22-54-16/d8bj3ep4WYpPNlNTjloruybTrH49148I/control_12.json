We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for claiming a second TV that was mistakenly delivered to their house. The context is that they moved in with two roommates, bought a TV together, split the cost, and the second TV showed up. The writer sold the second one and now one roommate is upset and wants a cut of the money. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The original TV was purchased under the writer's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. The second TV was a free additional one from Amazon, probably a mistake. The writer thought they could sell the second one since it was their name on the original order and didn't consider sharing the profit. The roommate who tried to buy the TV was upset when it was sold, demanding a share.\n\nNow, considering the agreements. The original agreement was they would split the cost and when moving out, sell and split profits. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The problem is, was the second TV a shared purchase or the writer's alone? Since the original was ordered under their Amazon account, the second one might have been accidentally sent to their address. The writer didn't inform the roommates about the second TV until after selling it. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. But the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. \n\nBut wait, the original purchase was a joint decision. The TV was bought for the living room, shared space, so perhaps the second TV, even if it was a mistake, became a communal asset once delivered. The writer might have assumed ownership because it was under their name, but the roommates might have a claim since they contributed to the original purchase. However, the mistake delivery might mean the second TV is the writer's property, not communal. \n\nThe key issue is whether the second TV was part of the shared purchase. Since it was an accident, the writer might have been the rightful owner, especially if the purchase was made under their account. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost, so they shouldn't be entitled to the proceeds. However, the writer didn't communicate the existence of the second TV to the roommates, which might have led to the conflict. The roommate who tried to buy the TV approached the writer, indicating they might have thought it was the writer's property, which supports the writer's position. \n\nBut the writer didn't consider the roommates' feelings or inform them about the second TV's arrival. Even though the second TV was a mistake, the writer should have discussed it with the roommates to avoid misunderstandings. The roommate's expectation of a share might stem from the original agreement, not realizing the second TV was a separate item. The writer's failure to communicate led to the conflict. \n\nHowever, the original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The writer wasn't obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV since it wasn't a shared purchase. The mistake delivery made it the writer's property, and they had the right to sell it. The roommate's entitlement was misplaced. The writer isn't in the wrong because they didn't owe them a share, but maybe they could have handled the communication better. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer isn't in the wrong (answer B) because the second TV wasn't part of the shared purchase, and the roommate's demands were unfounded. However, poor communication exacerbated the situation. But legally and based on the agreements mentioned, the writer isn't at fault.\n"
