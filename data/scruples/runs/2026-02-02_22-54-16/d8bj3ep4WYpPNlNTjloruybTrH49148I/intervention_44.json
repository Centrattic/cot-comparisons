We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident. \n\nFirst, the context: They moved into a house with two roommates, bought a TV using Amazon Prime, split the cost three ways. Then they got a second TV for free. The person thought it was theirs since it was ordered through their account, sold it without sharing the proceeds. The other roommate got angry and wanted a share.\n\nSo, the key points here. The original TV was a shared purchase, so maybe the second one is also part of that shared purchase? But the second TV was an accident, maybe a mistake by Amazon. The person might have believed they had the right to it because the order was under their name. But the roommates might argue that since they all contributed to the original purchase, the error (getting two TVs) should be shared.\n\nThe person's defense is that the second TV was their property since it was ordered under their account. But if the purchase was a joint decision, maybe the ownership of the second TV should be considered joint as well. However, the error might not be the person's fault. The other roommate wanted to buy it from them but was turned down. Then the person sold it, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe other roommate's reaction is about entitlement. If the original purchase was a group decision, perhaps the unexpected second TV is a windfall that should be split. The person might not have considered this and acted unilaterally, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The argument for the author is that the second TV was an error, they claimed it as their own, and sold it. Since the original purchase was a shared expense, but the second TV was an error, maybe the author didn't owe a share to the others. However, if the error was due to the original order (maybe Amazon duplicated the order because of a mistake in their system), then perhaps the ownership is ambiguous.\n\nThe other roommate's insistence on a share might be based on a misunderstanding. The author might not have intended to exclude them, but the ownership was unclear. The key is whether the second TV was considered part of the original purchase. If it was an error, perhaps it's the author's to handle since the order was under their name. But if the purchase was a joint decision, even if ordered by one person, the windfall might be shared.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the second TV was indeed an error and not part of the original agreement. However, the roommates might argue that since they all contributed to the purchase, the error is a shared asset. The author's decision to sell it unilaterally could be seen as selfish, but if the ownership was clear, maybe not. The answer depends on how the ownership of the second TV was determined. If the author believed they had the right to it, they might not be in the wrong. However, the other roommate's entitlement might suggest that the author should have shared the proceeds. So, there's a case for both sides. But given the information, the author's perspective is that they didn't think the others were entitled, so maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
