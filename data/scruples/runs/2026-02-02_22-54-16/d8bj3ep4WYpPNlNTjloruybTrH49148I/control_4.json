We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two others. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author claimed the second one as their own, sold it, and now one of the roommates is upset because they wanted a cut of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the agreement they had. The original TV was bought with a split cost, and they agreed that when they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. But the second TV was an accident. The key here is whether the second TV was a mistake and how the roommates' rights to it were established.\n\nThe author ordered the TV under their own account, so the original purchase was their responsibility. But since they split the cost with roommates, maybe there's an implied shared ownership? But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. Amazon sent an extra one by accident, so it's like a windfall. The question is, does the windfall belong to the person who ordered it, or does it become a shared asset because they were contributing to the original purchase?\n\nThe roommates might argue that since they shared the cost, the TV is a shared property, so the second one should be split among them too. But the author might say that since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement and it was delivered to their name, it's their to handle.\n\nThe roommate who tried to buy it from the author thought it was the author's, so the author might have had a reasonable belief that they could do with it what they wanted. However, the fact that they split the original cost could imply that any surplus from the TV (like the second one) is also a shared asset. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, so maybe it's separate.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consider the roommates' potential claims when selling it. Even if the second TV was their own, if there was an expectation of shared ownership in the original TV, maybe the second one should have been treated the same way. But the author thought they could claim it as their own because it was under their name.\n\nSo, the main points are: ownership of the original TV was shared because of the split cost, but the second TV was a mistake. If the second TV is a separate item, perhaps the author could claim it since it was delivered to their account. However, if the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they felt entitled to part of the second TV as well. But the author didn't communicate with them before selling it, which could be a problem.\n\nIn the end, the author might be in the wrong if the second TV was considered communal, but if it was a separate mistake and the author had the right to handle it, then they aren't. Since the problem is that the author didn't consider the roommates, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit confused because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. Hmm.\n"
