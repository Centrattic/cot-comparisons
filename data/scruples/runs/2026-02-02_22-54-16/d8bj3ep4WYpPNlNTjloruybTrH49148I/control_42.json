We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then selling it, without sharing the profits with their roommate.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime. They agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was identical but a different brand. The author thought it was their own and sold it, not sharing the money. The roommate who tried to buy it got upset and demanded a share.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement and the ownership of the second TV. The original TV was split in cost, so maybe they all had equal ownership. But the second TV was an error. The author took it as their own and sold it. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nThe author argues that the second TV was theirs because it was delivered under their name and they ordered the original. But the roommates might argue that since they shared the cost, any additional items from that order should be considered joint property. However, the second TV was a mistake by the seller. If the author's order was for one TV, getting two might mean the second was a mistake. The author might have a right to keep it if it's a delivery error, but maybe they should have checked with everyone first.\n\nThe problem is that the original purchase was split among three people. Even though the author ordered it, the cost was shared. So maybe the second TV, being a result of the same order, should be considered communal property? Or perhaps the error was Amazon's, so the author could claim it as their own since it was their account. \n\nAlso, the roommate was trying to buy the second TV, which the author refused. But when the author sold it to someone else, the roommate got angry. The author didn't consider sharing the profit, which might be the issue. Even if the author owned the second TV, maybe the roommates contributed to the original order, so there's a shared responsibility in that purchase. However, the second TV was an accident, so maybe it's separate. \n\nIt's tricky. If the second TV was a mistake, the author might not be obligated to share it. But the fact that the original purchase was a joint expense complicates things. The author might not have thought about the roommates' contributions affecting the ownership of the second TV. The main issue here is whether the second TV's ownership was clear. If the author's name was on it, and the delivery was under their account, they might have a claim. But the roommates might argue that since the order was part of a shared purchase, the error applies to all. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the second TV is considered part of the original joint purchase or a separate item. If it's the latter, the author isn't in the wrong. If it's part of the original order, then maybe they should have split the profits. The author didn't consider the roommates' contributions when taking the second TV, which might be why the roommate is upset. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the second TV's ownership with everyone upfront.\n"
