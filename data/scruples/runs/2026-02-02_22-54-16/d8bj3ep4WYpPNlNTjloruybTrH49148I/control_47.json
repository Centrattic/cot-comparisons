We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV purchase split among roommates, and a second TV being delivered by accident. The author sold the second TV, and their roommate is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was split three ways, so each roommate contributed equally. The agreement was that when they move out, the TV would be sold and profits split. But when a second TV arrived, the author took it as their own. \n\nThe key points here are ownership and prior agreements. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was shared. The second TV might be a result of an error, but does that mean it belongs to the person whose name was on the order? Maybe, but the roommates paid for half the cost. \n\nThe author thought they could sell the second TV because it was under their name. However, since the purchase was a shared expense, the second TV might also belong to all three, not just the author. The roommates might feel they have a claim because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nThe author didn't consider splitting the second TV's value. Even though the delivery was a mistake, the roommates might expect some sharing. The fact that one roommate kept trying to buy it suggests they felt entitled, but the author rejected those offers. \n\nIn terms of ethics, splitting the profits from the second TV could be fair since the cost was shared. The author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV before selling it, which might have been a mistake. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the roommates had a shared investment, and the second TV's value should be divided among all three. Even though the delivery error might mean the extra TV was a free gift, the shared cost implies shared ownership. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is wrong).\n"
