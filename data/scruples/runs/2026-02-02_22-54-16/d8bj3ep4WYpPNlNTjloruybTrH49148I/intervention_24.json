We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split among three roommates. When two TVs were delivered, the person sold the second one and faced backlash from a roommate who felt entitled to a share.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon account, and the cost was split three ways. The agreement was that when moving out, the TV would be sold and profits split. Then, an extra TV was delivered, which the author sold. The roommate who tried to buy it but was refused is now upset and demands a share of the money.\n\nThe main question is whether the author had the right to claim the second TV as their own. Since the original purchase was under their name, the second TV might be considered a mistake on the seller's part, possibly intended for the author. However, the cost was split, so does the cost sharing extend to the second TV? The author's roommates didn't pay for the second one, so maybe the author has the right to it. But the author also agreed to split profits when moving out, but that was for the original TV. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement.\n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the cost was split, they should have a share of any profits from the second TV. But since the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement and the roommates didn't contribute to it, the author might not be obligated to share. The author didn't intend to keep it but sold it, and the roommate's reaction is about feeling entitled. The author didn't consider the roommates in this case because the second TV wasn't part of the original deal. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified because the second TV was an error and not part of the shared purchase. The original agreement only covered the first TV. The author's decision to sell it without consulting the roommates could be seen as a mistake, but the entitlement to the money might not be there. The roommate's demand seems unfounded since they didn't pay for the second TV. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
