We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The key points here are the initial purchase, the delivery error, and the subsequent actions.\n\nFirst, the TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime. They split the cost with two roommates. So the original TV is a group purchase. But the second TV was an error. The question is about ownership of the second TV. Since it was an error, it's not clear if the house is responsible for both. The author thought it was theirs because it was under their name, but the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim.\n\nThe author tried to sell the second TV, and one roommate was persistent in buying it. The author refused offers and eventually gave it to someone else. The roommate then got angry and demanded a share of the proceeds. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe main issue is whether the second TV belongs to the author alone or is a shared asset. Since the purchase was made with shared funds, even though ordered by one person, the roommates might have a claim. However, the second TV was an error, not part of their original order. So maybe it's a separate item. The author might argue that since it was a mistake, it's their property to handle. But the roommates could feel entitled because the initial purchase was a shared expense. \n\nIn some cases, when a purchase is made jointly, even if ordered by one person, the assets are considered shared. The error might complicate things. If the delivery company sent two TVs by mistake, it's possible that the house is responsible for both, making them shared property. The author might not have the sole right to sell the second TV. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the roommate approached them specifically, thinking it was theirs. But if the original purchase was split among roommates, then the second TV could be considered a joint asset. The author not consulting the roommates before selling might be the issue here. Even if they thought it was theirs, the error might mean that the ownership isn't clear. \n\nSo, considering that the purchase was a shared expense, the second TV being an error (which might have been a duplication of the correct order), the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds with the roommates. The fact that one roommate was trying to buy it and the author refused offers, then sold it without their input, could mean the author acted unilaterally. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
