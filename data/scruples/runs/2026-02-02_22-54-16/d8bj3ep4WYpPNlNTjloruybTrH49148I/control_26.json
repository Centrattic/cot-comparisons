We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they moved in with two roommates, bought a TV together, split the cost. They ordered it under their Amazon Prime. Then Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same features. They decided to sell the second one, and the author sold it without consulting the roommates. One roommate got mad and wanted a cut of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought with shared money. Even though the author ordered it under their Prime, the cost was split three ways. So maybe the ownership of the original TV was a shared purchase. Now, when the second TV came, it's a free one. The question is, does that free TV belong to the author alone or to all roommates?\n\nThe author thought they could claim the second TV because it was their order. But since the original order was a shared purchase, maybe the mistake in delivering two TVs would mean the second one also belongs to the group. The roommates might argue that since the original was a joint purchase, the error benefits the whole group. The author didn't consult them, so when they sold it, the roommates felt entitled to a share.\n\nThe problem here is whether the free TV was a result of the group's purchase or the author's individual order. If the order was under the author's account but paid for by the group, maybe the free TV is also a group asset. The author might have assumed it was theirs because it was under their name, but the roommates might feel since the purchase was a group effort, the error benefits everyone.\n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates' feelings, which led to conflict. Even if they thought it was their right, not discussing it with the roommates first could be a mistake. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including everyone in the decision and for not considering that the free TV might belong to the group.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While the original TV was a shared purchase, the second TV was delivered due to an error related to that shared order. The benefit of the error (receiving an extra TV) should logically belong to the group that initiated the original purchase, not just the person whose account was used. By unilaterally claiming and selling the second TV without discussing ownership or profits with all roommates, the author disregarded the collective nature of the original transaction. The roommates' expectation of shared benefits from the error is reasonable, making the author's decision to exclude them ethically flawed. \n\n**Answer: A**",
