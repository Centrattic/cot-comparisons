We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was accidentally delivered twice. The main points are: the TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime, the cost was split among three roommates, and when a second TV came, the author sold it, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the original purchase: the author ordered the TV under their Amazon account but the cost was split three ways. So, even though the purchase was made under the author's name, the ownership was shared. The key here is whether the second TV, which was a mistake, is considered part of that shared purchase. If the order was for one TV and Amazon sent two, the second one was an error. The roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they all have a claim to the second TV as well. The author thought they could sell it since it was under their name, but if the order was a joint purchase, the second TV might belong to all three. \n\nThe author's roommates had a right to expect that any surplus from the joint purchase would be split among them. The author didn't consult them, which could be seen as a mistake. The roommate who kept offering to buy it might have felt entitled, but the author's refusal and then selling it without agreement might be the issue. The author didn't consider that the second TV was a result of a shared expense and thus a shared asset. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include the roommates in the decision about the second TV. Even though the purchase was under their name, the initial agreement was to split costs and profits. The error in delivery leading to an extra TV could be considered a windfall that should be shared. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
