We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story did the wrong thing by claiming a second TV that was delivered by mistake and then selling it.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author moved into a house with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The author ordered it using their Amazon Prime, which had a discount. They agreed that when they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits three ways or sell it to the roommate who wanted it. \n\nThen, the delivery day came and there were two TVs. The second one was a different brand but same specs. The author thought it was theirs because their name was on the order. They wanted to sell it, and one roommate kept trying to buy it but the author turned down offers. Eventually, the author sold the TV to someone else. The same roommate got upset, thinking she was entitled to a portion of the money. The other roommate had no issues. \n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The original purchase was split among three people. The second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author's name was on the order, so maybe they have a claim to it. However, since the original cost was split three ways, maybe the second TV should also be considered communal property? Wait, but the second TV was an error. The author didn't pay for it, so maybe it's their property to handle? \n\nThe key points here are ownership and agreement. The original TV was a shared purchase, but the second TV was an unforeseen delivery. The author might have assumed it was theirs because their name was on the order. However, since the cost was split, maybe the roommates had a shared expectation in any additional benefits from the purchase. \n\nBut the author didn't ask the roommates about the second TV. They just decided to sell it. Maybe they should have discussed it first. However, the original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. Since the second TV was a mistake, it's unclear if it's the author's to dispose of. \n\nWait, if the second TV was mistakenly delivered, technically it's the author's property because it was shipped to their name. But since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they had an implicit right to any surplus? But the author didn't know about the second TV until delivery. The mistake wasn't their fault. \n\nThe author's roommate might feel entitled because they contributed to the original cost. But the second TV was a free item, not part of the original purchase. The author might not be obligated to share the proceeds from selling a mistakenly delivered item. However, the roommates might see it as a shared resource since the initial purchase was shared. \n\nBut the original agreement was about the first TV. The second TV wasn't part of that. The author might have the right to keep it, but maybe should have checked with the roommates. However, the author didn't know about the second TV until it arrived. The mistake was Amazon's. The author had no reason to believe the second TV was communal. \n\nSo, in terms of legal ownership, the author's name was on the order, so they likely own the second TV. Ethically, even though the cost was split, the second TV was a mistake, so the author isn't necessarily obligated to share it. However, the author could have considered splitting the proceeds if they felt it was fair, but they weren't wrong to not do so if they believed it was theirs. \n\nThe other roommate's reaction seems unfair if the author owned the second TV. The author didn't lie; it was a mistake. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
