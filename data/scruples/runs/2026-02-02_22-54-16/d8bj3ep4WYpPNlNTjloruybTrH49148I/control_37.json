We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a TV that was accidentally delivered twice, and the author sold the second one without splitting the profit with their roommate. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The main points are:\n\n1. The author and two roommates bought a TV together, split the cost three ways, and agreed on how to handle it if they moved out.\n2. The author ordered the TV under their Amazon Prime account.\n3. Amazon delivered two TVs, and the author took the second one, thinking it was theirs, and sold it.\n4. One roommate kept trying to buy it but was turned down. Later, when the author sold it, the same roommate got angry and demanded a cut of the money.\n5. The other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe author is asking if they did the wrong thing by not sharing the profit from the second TV. \n\nSo, the key questions here are about ownership of the second TV. Since the original TV was ordered under the author's account but paid for by all three roommates, there's a shared ownership. The second TV might be an error, but how does that affect ownership?\n\nIf the second TV is considered a mistake by Amazon, it might have been sent as a duplicate. But since the cost was split, maybe the extra TV should have been considered communal property. The author might have assumed it was theirs because it was under their name, but since the purchase was a joint effort, perhaps the roommates should have a share.\n\nAlso, the author agreed that when moving out, profits from selling the original TV would be split. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. However, since the second TV was a result of the same purchase, maybe the roommates had a right to expect a share of any extra value.\n\nThe author didn't consider the roommates when selling the second TV. Even if the original was under their name, the purchase was a shared expense. So the extra TV could be seen as an unexpected gain from the shared purchase, which should be split.\n\nThe angry roommate's argument is that she's entitled to a cut because they all paid for the initial TV. The author's reasoning was that since it was under their name, they could do with it what they wanted. But maybe that's not the case if the roommates contributed to the cost.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the roommates had a shared financial stake in the original purchase, the unexpected second TV might be considered a shared gain. The author might have been wrong to not split the profit from the second TV, even though they ordered it under their account.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the second TV is considered an extension of the shared purchase. If yes, then the author is in the wrong for not sharing the profit. If not, maybe not. But given that the purchase was a joint decision and cost, the author probably should have discussed the second TV with the roommates. Therefore, the answer is A (in the wrong).\n"
