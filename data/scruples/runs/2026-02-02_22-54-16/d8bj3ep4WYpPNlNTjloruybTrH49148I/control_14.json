We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The setup is that they moved into a house with two roommates and bought a TV using their Amazon Prime account, splitting the cost three ways. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The author ended up selling the second one, and one roommate got upset about not getting a share of the proceeds.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The main issue is whether the second TV belongs to the author or if the roommates have a claim to it. The TV was ordered under the author's account, but the cost was split. The second TV was a free one, but it's the same as the first. The author sold it without consulting the roommates, and one is upset.\n\nThe author argues that since the original purchase was under their name, the second TV was theirs to handle. The roommates contributed to the original purchase. The question is about ownership of the second TV. \n\nLegally, if the second TV was a mistake by Amazon, it might be considered the author's property since it was delivered to their address and under their account. However, morally, since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a claim? But the original agreement was about splitting the cost and splitting the profits from selling the TV. The second TV is an unexpected gain. \n\nThe author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV. The roommate who tried to buy it thought it was the author's, but when the author sold it without consulting, that caused conflict. The other roommate didn't have an issue. \n\nMoral obligations can be tricky here. If there was an agreement to split profits from any resale of the original TV, does the second TV fall under that agreement? The second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author bought one TV, got another for free. The roommates might feel they should benefit from that error. \n\nBut the author could argue that since the error was on Amazon's side, and the second TV was in their name, they have the right to handle it. However, since the original purchase was a shared expense, maybe the roommates have some claim to the second TV as well. \n\nThe key is whether the roommates had a right to the second TV. If there was an agreement that any purchases related to the TV would be shared, then the second TV might also be considered communal. The author didn't consult them, so maybe they should have. \n\nBut the author might not have considered it part of the shared purchase since it was an error. The problem is that the roommates contributed to the original cost, so maybe they feel entitled to a share in any profits from the error as well. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommates helped pay for the first TV, they might feel they should share in the windfall from the second. The author sold the second TV without consulting them, which could be seen as selfish. However, legally, the author is the one who ordered it, so they might have a claim. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether there was an agreement about shared ownership of any items purchased for the living room. If the agreement was that all purchases for communal items are shared, then the second TV would be part of that. If not, then the author might be justified in keeping it. \n\nSince the author didn't clarify this and sold it without discussion, maybe they should have considered their roommates. The fact that one roommate was very upset suggests that not consulting them was a mistake. Even if the author thought it was theirs, sharing the proceeds might have been the right thing to do to maintain good relations. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their roommates' possible expectations, even if legally it's their property. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and the roommates contributed to the original cost, leading to a shared responsibility.\n"
