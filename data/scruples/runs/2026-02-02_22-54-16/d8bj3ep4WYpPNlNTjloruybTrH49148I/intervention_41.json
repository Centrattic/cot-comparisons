We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them moving into a house with two roommates, buying a TV with a discount through their Amazon Prime, splitting the cost three ways. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs, and the author sold the second one without giving a share to one of the roommates, who got upset.\n\nFirst, the TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split. The second TV was an accident, so it's a free item. The roommates agreed to split the original TV's cost, and there was an agreement about splitting the profits when selling. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author didn't owe the roommates anything for the free TV since it wasn't part of the initial purchase. The other roommate didn't have an issue, only the one who tried to buy it.\n\nThe author sold the second TV, which wasn't part of the shared purchase. The key here is that the second TV was an unexpected item, and the original agreement was about the first TV. The author didn't share the second TV's proceeds because it wasn't part of the initial deal. The upset roommate's demands might be based on a misunderstanding or assuming ownership without prior agreement. Legally and ethically, since the second TV was an accident and not part of the shared purchase, the author isn't obligated to share it. So, the answer is B.\n"
