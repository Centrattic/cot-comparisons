We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered and then selling it.\n\nFirst, the context: They moved into a house with two roommates. They bought a TV together, split the cost, and agreed on selling it when they moved out. The person ordered it under their Amazon Prime because of a discount. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was the same specs but a different brand. The person decided to sell the second TV, not considering the roommates, and ended up selling it to someone else. One roommate was upset and wanted her share of the money, but the author didn't give it to them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Original TV**: The TV was purchased by three roommates, so even though it was ordered under one person's name, the cost was split three ways. That might imply shared ownership. However, if the agreement was that any profits from selling it would be split after moving out, maybe the original TV's ownership is clear. But the second TV is the issue here.\n\n2. **The Second TV**: It was a free second TV that came by mistake. The author claims it as their own because it was delivered under their name. But the cost wasn't split. However, the roommate argues they should get a share of the proceeds because they contributed to the original purchase. Wait, no, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The original purchase was split three ways. The second TV was an error. So the second TV isn't part of that agreement. The author might think they can keep it since it was an unexpected free item, not part of the original shared expense.\n\n3. **Agreements**: The roommates had an agreement about the original TV, but the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author didn't mention discussing the second TV with roommates. The roommate who wanted to buy it approached the author directly, assuming it was the author's. However, since the original purchase was shared, maybe the second TV's ownership is ambiguous. But since it was a free second item due to an error, perhaps the author has the right to claim it.\n\n4. **Ethics**: The author sold the TV without consulting the roommates. While the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, the roommate might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, even though the second TV was free. But ethically, if the second TV was an error and not part of the original shared expense, the author might have the right to keep it. However, it's possible that the roommate's expectation of sharing the profits wasn't unreasonable if there was an implicit agreement about any TVs in the house.\n\n5. **Communication**: The author didn't discuss the second TV with roommates. The roommate who wanted to buy it approached the author, but maybe the author should have clarified ownership. However, the author might have thought since it was a separate item and not part of the original purchase, it's theirs to handle.\n\nIn terms of legal ownership, if the second TV was delivered to the house and the original purchase was shared, it's possible that all three roommates could claim a right to it. But since the author ordered it under their Amazon account, maybe they have a stronger claim. However, since the cost was split, the original purchase might have been a shared expense, but the second TV wasn't part of that. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as not in the wrong because the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The roommate's anger might stem from not understanding that the second TV was separate. However, the author didn't consider the roommates' potential interest in the second TV. Even if it was a free item, sharing it could have been the ethical choice, especially since the original purchase was shared. But the author didn't think they were entitled to a share, so from their perspective, it's not wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, depending on the agreements and how the second TV was handled, the author might not be in the wrong. The key is whether there was an agreement about the second TV, which there wasn't. So the answer is B.\n"
