We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The original TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime account, and the cost was split three ways. So, they ordered it with their account but everyone contributed to the cost.\n\nFirst, the main point here is ownership. The TV was purchased under their Amazon Prime, which might imply that they are the one who actually owns it. But since the cost was split, maybe there's a shared ownership aspect. However, the second TV\u2014since it was a mistake by Amazon\u2014might not be their property. The key question is whether the second TV is actually theirs to claim.\n\nThe roommate kept trying to buy it from the author, thinking it was the author's. The author sold it without consulting the roommates, leading to a conflict. The roommate feels entitled to a portion of the money because she argues it's a shared purchase. But the original purchase was a single TV, and the second was an error. The mistake might mean that the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. \n\nAmazon's error complicates things. If the second TV was an accidental delivery, the author might need to return it or contact Amazon first. However, in this case, they took ownership and sold it. The original agreement was about the TV they ordered, so the second one isn't covered by that. The roommates contributed to the first TV, but the second wasn't part of their shared purchase. Therefore, the author isn't obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV. \n\nThe other roommate had no issues, which might suggest that the second TV wasn't part of the original plan. The problem arises because the one roommate had a different expectation. The author might not be in the wrong because the second TV was an error and not part of the agreed-upon purchase. They made a good-faith effort to sell it, and since the roommates didn't have a prior agreement about accidental deliveries, the author's decision not to share the money is justified.\n"
