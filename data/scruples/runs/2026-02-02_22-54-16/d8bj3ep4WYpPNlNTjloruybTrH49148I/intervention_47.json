We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. The second TV was identical but a different brand. The author sold it, and one roommate is upset, demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original purchase was made by the author with their account. The agreement was to split the cost, but it's unclear if there was an agreement about ownership of the TV. The second TV was an error, so the author probably isn't responsible for it. When the roommate tried to buy it, the author likely saw it as their own since it was their purchase. Selling it without consulting roommates might be the issue, but since the original agreement was about the first TV, maybe the second one is the author's to handle. However, since the cost was split, maybe the second TV's value should be split too? Or is the second TV considered a windfall since it was an accident?\n\nThe roommate's claim is based on splitting the cost of the original TV, but the second one wasn't part of their agreement. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't intend to keep the second TV beyond their own use. The fact that the other roommate had no issues supports that. The angry roommate might be overstepping by expecting a share of the proceeds from an accidental delivery. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
