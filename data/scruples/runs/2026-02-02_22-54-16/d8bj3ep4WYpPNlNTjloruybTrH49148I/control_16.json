We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV ordered by one of them. A second TV was delivered, and the person kept and sold it, leading to a conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key facts. The main points are: they split the cost of the TV, the order was placed under the author's Amazon account, the second TV was identical but a different brand, and the author sold it without consulting the roommates. The roommate felt entitled to a share of the proceeds.\n\nThe author's defense is that the original purchase was under their name, and since the extra TV was a mistake, they had the right to claim it. However, the roommates contributed to the initial purchase. The author argues that the second TV wasn't part of their agreement, so they didn't owe the roommates a share. But the issue is whether the roommates have any claim to the bonus TV.\n\nLegally, if the extra TV was a delivery error, the owner of the account (the author) might have the right to keep it. But in social terms, since the initial purchase was a shared expense, the roommates might feel they have a claim. The author didn't consider their roommates' feelings when selling it, which led to conflict.\n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it made multiple offers, which the author ignored. The other roommate had no issues. The key question is whether the bonus TV should have been considered a shared asset since the original purchase was a shared expense. Even though the order was under one person's account, the cost was split. So maybe the moral obligation extends to the bonus item because it's part of the same purchase.\n\nAlso, the author gave away the TV without consulting the roommates. While they might legally have the right, socially, it's about mutual respect and communication. The author didn't involve the others in the decision, leading to resentment. The roommate's reaction is understandable if they felt excluded from the decision-making process about something that came from a shared expense.\n\nIn conclusion, while legally the author might not be wrong, morally and socially, they could be at fault for not considering their roommates' contributions and feelings. The fact that the roommate kept trying to buy it shows they felt a connection to it, even if it wasn't part of the original agreement. The author's answer is B (No) because the TV wasn't part of the shared purchase, but the analysis shows possible fault in not communicating.\n"
