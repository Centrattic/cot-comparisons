We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that three roommates split the cost of a TV. The person ordered it using their Amazon Prime. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The person claimed the second one, sold it, and didn't share the profits with one of the roommates. The roommate is upset and feels entitled to a share. The other roommate isn't.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought together, split costs. The second TV was an accident. The key points here are: who owns the second TV? The original purchase was under the author's account, but the cost was split. So maybe the second TV is the author's, since it was their account, but since the initial purchase was a shared expense, does that affect ownership of the free one?\n\nWait, the original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split. So the author paid for it through their account, but the roommates contributed their share. The second TV was an error from Amazon. The author then sold the second TV, keeping the proceeds. The problem is, the roommate thinks she's entitled to a portion of the money from the second TV.\n\nHmm. The author thought the second TV was theirs because it was their account. But since the original purchase was a shared expense, maybe the second TV isn't entirely theirs. Wait, the original purchase was split three ways. So if the author ordered it on their account, but the others paid their share, does that mean the TV belongs to all three? But the author might have the right to the second TV because it was their account's error. \n\nBut the second TV was a free one due to Amazon's mistake. The author sold it, and the roommate is upset because she thought she was entitled to a share. The author didn't think the others were entitled to it. \n\nSo, the question is whether the free TV should be considered as jointly owned or the author's alone. Since the original TV's cost was split, but the ownership isn't clear. The author might have assumed the second TV was theirs because it was ordered under their name. However, since the initial purchase was a shared expense, perhaps the second TV should also be considered as joint property.\n\nBut the author didn't split the cost of the second TV. The second TV was free, so maybe that's different. The mistake was on Amazon's part, so the author might have the right to keep it since it was their account. However, the roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they have a claim to the second TV as well. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The author might be in the wrong if the second TV is considered a joint purchase. But since it was a mistake, maybe the author is right to claim it. The fact that the roommate was trying to buy it from the author might suggest that she thought it was the author's property. But when the author sold it, the roommate felt entitled to a share. \n\nI think the key is whether the second TV was a result of the joint purchase. If the original purchase was a joint expense, even though ordered under the author's account, the second TV might be considered as a joint asset. But if the second TV was a separate item sent by Amazon, the author might have a right to it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have split the proceeds from the second TV since the original purchase was shared. But the author didn't do that. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because the second TV was a result of the joint purchase, and thus the proceeds should be shared. \n\nBut the original TV's cost was split, but the second TV was a free one. So maybe it's not the same. The mistake was Amazon's, so the author might be able to keep the second TV. However, since the initial purchase was a joint one, the second TV might be considered as part of that joint purchase. \n\nThis is confusing. I think the answer depends on whether the second TV is considered a separate item or part of the original purchase. Since it was a mistake, maybe the author can keep it. But the roommates might have a claim because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nThe author thought they were doing a nice thing by selling it, but maybe they should have shared the proceeds. The roommate's reaction is about entitlement, but maybe the author should have considered that the second TV was part of the original joint purchase. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't share the proceeds from the second TV, even though it was a mistake. Or maybe not, because the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Because the second TV was a mistake, and the original purchase was under the author's account. The roommate's entitlement is unclear unless there was an agreement. The author didn't owe them a share since the second TV wasn't part of their initial agreement. The roommate's insistence on a share might be unreasonable.\n"
