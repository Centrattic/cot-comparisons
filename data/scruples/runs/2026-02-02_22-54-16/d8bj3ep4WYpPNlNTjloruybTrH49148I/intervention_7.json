We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the user bought a TV with roommates, split the cost three ways. They ordered it under their Amazon Prime, and then Amazon sent two TVs. The user kept one and sold the second one without consulting the roommates. Now one roommate is upset and wants a portion of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the original agreement. The user and roommates agreed that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. But the second TV, which was an error, wasn't part of that original agreement. The user might have thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered under their account. But the cost was split, so maybe the ownership of the first TV is shared. But the second TV was a mistake. \n\nThe user sold the second TV, and one roommate is now upset. The question is whether the user was wrong in selling it and not sharing the proceeds. Since the second TV was a free one, it's unclear if the roommates have a claim to it. The original purchase was split, so maybe the first TV is shared property, but the second one, being a mistake, might have been the user's to handle. However, the user should have discussed it with all roommates first. The user's roommate felt entitled, but maybe they aren't. The user might have made an assumption that the second TV was theirs because it was ordered under their name, but the shared cost complicates ownership. \n\nIn the end, the user sold the TV without consulting, leading to conflict. While the user might not be entirely wrong, they could have been more transparent. But the key is whether the roommates had a legal or moral right to the second TV. Since the error was Amazon's and the purchase was under the user's account, the user might have the right to it. However, the initial agreement only covered selling on move-out, so the second TV might not be part of that. I think the user isn't in the wrong, but they should have communicated better. Answer is B.\n"
