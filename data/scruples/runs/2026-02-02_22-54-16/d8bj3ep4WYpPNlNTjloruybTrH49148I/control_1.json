We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a free TV that was accidentally delivered because they ordered one. The main question is whether they should have shared the proceeds from selling the second TV with their roommates.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. The roommates agreed that when they move out, they'd split the profits from selling the TV. But then Amazon sent a second TV. The author assumed it was theirs, sold it, and kept the money. The roommate then got angry and wanted a share.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The original purchase was a shared expense, so maybe the roommates had an expectation of owning the TV together. The second TV was a free one, but since they paid for the first one, maybe there's an argument that the second one belongs to all of them because it was a result of a shared purchase. However, the author ordered it under their own account. But since they split the cost, perhaps the roommates have a claim to the free item as well.\n\nBut the author didn't think the roommates were entitled. They sold the TV without consulting them, leading to conflict. The other roommate didn't mind, but one was upset. The question is whether the author had the right to keep the second TV entirely.\n\nIn terms of legalities, if the TV was delivered to the shared address and the order was paid for with split funds, maybe the second TV is considered communal property. However, since the author initiated the order and the second TV was an error, maybe it's their responsibility to handle the error. But since the purchase was a joint decision and cost shared, maybe the free item should be shared.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author didn't consider their roommates' potential claim to the second TV. Even though they ordered it, the purchase was a shared expense. So, they might be in the right in thinking it's theirs, but since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, they could have a claim to the free one. The author should have discussed with roommates before selling. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering their roommates' possible claims.\n"
