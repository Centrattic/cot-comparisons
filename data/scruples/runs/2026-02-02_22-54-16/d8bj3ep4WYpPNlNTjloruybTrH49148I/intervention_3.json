We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person moved into a house with two roommates and they agreed to buy a TV together, splitting the cost three ways. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime because of a discount. They had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. \n\nThen, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The second one is a different brand but the same features. The author thought it was their own and proposed selling it. The other roommate kept offering to buy it, but the author eventually sold it to someone else. The roommate who tried to buy it is upset and claims the author should share the money. The other roommate isn't upset.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was entitled to the second TV. The original TV was paid for by all three roommates, so the second one, being a mistake, might be considered the author's because it was shipped to their address and the order was under their name. The author didn't intend to keep it but saw it as a bonus to help with the shared expense. The other roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. \n\nBut legally, if the delivery was a mistake, the second TV might belong to the person who received it, especially if it was shipped under their account. The author didn't ask for it, so they might have a right to it. However, ethically, there's a question about sharing the windfall with the roommates since the original purchase was shared. The author decided not to share, which upset one roommate.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the TV was mistakenly delivered to their address and ordered under their name, so they had the right to handle it. The roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a portion of the proceeds since they contributed to the original purchase. However, the original agreement was about splitting the cost and future profits from the original TV, not the free one that arrived by mistake.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the second TV wasn't a shared purchase; it was an error. The roommates didn't contribute to it, and the author had no obligation to share the proceeds unless there was a prior agreement about such scenarios. Since there wasn't, the author's decision is justified. The mistake TV became their property, and selling it without sharing makes sense unless there's a community agreement. The other roommate's reaction seems unreasonable since the TV wasn't theirs. So, answer B.\n"
