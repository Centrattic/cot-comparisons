We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for claiming a free TV that arrived with their name on it when they had roommates. The TV was ordered under their Amazon Prime, and they split the cost. The free TV was sold, and one roommate is upset about not getting a share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who owns the free TV. The original purchase was made under the author's account, and they paid for it through their Prime. The roommates agreed to split the cost, but the free TV was an accident. The author thought they could claim it because it was under their name. \n\nBut wait, when they bought the TV, they had an agreement to split costs. The free TV came as a result of that purchase. If the free TV is considered part of the purchase, maybe it should be considered joint property since it resulted from a shared expense. But the original purchase was their account. So maybe the free TV is their personal property. \n\nThe roommate who wanted to buy it approached the author directly. The author sold it without consulting the others. The other roommate had no issue, but one was upset about not getting a share. The author didn't think the roommates were entitled to it. \n\nI need to check if the free TV was a result of the group's shared purchase. If the purchase was a joint decision and the cost was split, then the free TV might be considered a joint asset. However, since the author ordered it under their own account, maybe they have a stronger claim. The problem is the expectation of the roommates. \n\nThe key points are: who owns the free item when it's a result of a shared expense. Legal ownership might be with the person whose name is on the order. But if the purchase was a group decision, the free item could be considered part of the group's joint property. The author might have assumed they could handle it because it was under their name, but the roommates might have expected a shared approach. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is based on feeling entitled because of splitting the cost. But the free TV wasn't part of their initial agreement. They didn't agree to split the free TV. So the author's action might be justified if the free TV was a separate item not discussed. However, the fact that the purchase was a group decision complicates it. \n\nIn the end, the author didn't consult the roommates about the free TV, leading to one being upset. Even if they thought it was theirs, the lack of communication might be an issue. But legally, if the free TV was an error and addressed to the author, they might have the right to it. So the answer could swing either way. But the user's reasoning suggests they think the author isn't in the wrong. I have to decide if the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were wrong. If the free TV was a mistake, and the author didn't share the proceeds, but the roommates didn't have an agreement for such a scenario, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
