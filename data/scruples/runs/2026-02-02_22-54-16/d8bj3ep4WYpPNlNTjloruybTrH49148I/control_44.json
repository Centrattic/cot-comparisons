We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, and then a second TV was delivered by accident. The author sold the second TV and now another roommate is upset and wants a share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was split in cost three ways. But the order was placed by the author, so maybe they had control over it. The second TV was a free one, which they didn't need, so the author decided to sell it. The other roommate kept trying to buy it but the author didn't accept. Then the author sold it without telling the roommate, and now she's mad, thinking she's entitled to a share.\n\nI need to consider if there was an agreement about the second TV. The original agreement was about splitting the cost of the first TV and splitting profits if they sold it later. The second TV wasn't part of that original agreement. The author didn't mention anything about the second TV to the roommates, maybe because they thought it was an error and didn't realize it might belong to all of them. But since the second TV came under the same order, maybe it was considered part of the original purchase. But the cost wasn't split for the second one, right? The original purchase was split for the first TV. The second one was free, so maybe the author thought it was their own to handle. However, since they were sharing the house, perhaps there's a shared responsibility or expectation.\n\nThe key here is whether the second TV was considered communal property. The original TV was split, but the second one wasn't explicitly discussed. The author might have assumed that since it was a mistake, they could handle it, but the roommate felt entitled because the original purchase was shared. The author didn't get input from the others about the second TV. So maybe the author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates first, even if they didn't think it was necessary. Since the second TV was a result of the original order, which they all contributed to, maybe the roommates had a right to be considered in what to do with the free TV.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not consulting the roommates about the second TV. Even though the original cost was split, the free TV's ownership wasn't clear. The author acted unilaterally, which led to conflict. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not including the roommates in the decision, especially since the initial purchase was a shared expense. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the roommates' possible entitlement due to the shared initial purchase, even if the second TV was a mistake.\n"
