We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split among three roommates. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The person sold the second TV and now a roommate is upset and demanding a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author, but the cost was split three ways. So, the initial purchase was a shared expense. However, the second TV was an accident from Amazon. The author decided to sell it, thinking it was theirs because it was ordered under their name. The other roommate tried to buy it but was turned down, then when the TV was sold, that roommate got angry and demanded a cut.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the arguments. On one hand, the original purchase was split among roommates, so maybe there's a shared ownership in the original TV. But the second TV was a mistake. Since the author ordered it under their own account, maybe they have a claim to it. However, since the cost was split, perhaps the roommates have some entitlement to the second TV as well?\n\nWait, the original purchase was split, so the cost was shared. But the second TV was free, so maybe the author didn't pay anything extra for it. The problem is whether the free TV is considered part of the shared purchase or an unexpected benefit that belongs to the person whose name was on the order.\n\nAnother angle: when the author ordered the TV, they might have had the roommates' agreement to split costs, but the second TV was an error. The author might have thought that since they ordered it, the free TV was their own to handle. However, since the original purchase was a joint effort, maybe the roommates would expect the free TV to be shared or sold with proceeds split.\n\nBut the author sold it without consulting the roommates. The other roommate tried to buy it from the author, so maybe there was an expectation that the free TV was part of the shared purchase. The author didn't consider that the free TV might belong to all three, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because even though they ordered the original TV, the second TV, as an error, might be considered joint property since the original purchase was shared. Selling it without consulting the roommates could be seen as taking something that belongs to everyone. Alternatively, since the second TV was a mistake and not ordered by anyone else, maybe it's the author's to keep if they paid for the original order.\n\nBut the cost was split, so the original purchase was a shared expense. The second TV, being a freebie due to an error, might be considered a shared benefit. Therefore, the author should have split the proceeds from selling the second TV among the roommates. By not doing so, they took something that the roommates might consider their share.\n\nHowever, the original TV was ordered under the author's account. Maybe the second TV, being an error, was delivered to the address, but the author's name was on the order. So, technically, it might be their property. But since they split the cost, the roommates might feel entitled to a portion of the free TV as well.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. I think the key is whether the second TV was considered part of the shared purchase. If the roommates were part of the original purchase, then the error might be considered a shared benefit. However, since the author ordered it under their own account, maybe they have more claim to the free TV. But the author should have discussed with the roommates before selling it, especially since the cost was split.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have made a mistake by not considering the roommates' possible claims to the second TV, even if they ordered it. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But another perspective is that the free TV belongs to the person whose order it was, so B (not in the wrong).\n"
