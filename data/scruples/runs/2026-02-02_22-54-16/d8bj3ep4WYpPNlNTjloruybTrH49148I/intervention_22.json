We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with costs split three ways. An extra TV was delivered by mistake, and the author sold it, leading to a conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the original TV. Since the author ordered it under their Amazon Prime and paid for it, even though the cost was split, they might have the right to the free TV. However, the roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the purchase. The key point is whether the free TV was a result of their combined purchase or just a mistake by Amazon.\n\nThe author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV right away and sold it without consulting them. Even though the original TV was bought under their name, the free TV might have been an error, so ownership could be unclear. The author's roommate felt entitled to a portion of the proceeds because they contributed to the original cost. The author's refusal to consider the roommates might have been a mistake, as the free TV could be considered a joint asset since the purchase was shared.\n\nHowever, the original agreement was that any profits from selling the original TV would be split. The free TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author might have assumed the free TV was theirs because it was a result of their order. But since the roommates were involved in the initial purchase, maybe the free TV should be shared. The author didn't handle it well by not discussing it with everyone first, leading to conflict. So, there's a case for the author being in the wrong for not considering the roommates' contributions and not communicating properly.\n"
