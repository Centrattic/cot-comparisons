We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a TV that was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, with roommates splitting the cost. Then, two TVs were delivered, and the author sold the second one. The roommate gets upset and claims she's entitled to a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was ordered by the author but paid for by three roommates. So the cost was split. The second TV was an accident from Amazon. The author proposed selling it, and the roommate tried to buy it but was turned down. Then the author sold it to someone else, and the roommate got angry, demanding a share. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was wrong in claiming the second TV as theirs and not sharing the proceeds. The author argues that the TV was under their name and that they didn't owe the roommates anything.\n\nI should consider ownership. The original purchase was under the author's account, but the cost was split. So the ownership of the original TV was shared, right? But the second TV was a mistake. If Amazon sent an extra, does that mean the author owns it? Or does it belong to all roommates since the original purchase was a shared expense?\n\nWait, the original purchase was split three ways, but the order was placed on the author's account. So maybe the author had the right to handle the second TV since it was their account. But the problem is that the cost was shared, so maybe the second TV's ownership should also be shared?\n\nBut the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The roommates agreed to split the cost of one TV. The second one was an error. How do you handle property that's delivered by mistake? In legal terms, usually, the person who received it by mistake can return it or keep it if the seller is notified. But since it was a physical item, maybe the author could do with it as they wished unless there was an agreement to split all purchases.\n\nThe roommates might have thought that since they all contributed to the original purchase, any additional items received would be shared. But the author didn't see it that way. There's no explicit agreement mentioned about what to do if there were bonuses or errors. The original agreement was only about the TV they bought and splitting profits when moving out.\n\nThe roommate who got angry might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase. But legally, the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The author ordered it under their account, so maybe ownership was clear. The other roommate didn't have an issue, which might indicate that there was no prior agreement about shared ownership of all purchases.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because the second TV was an error, not part of the original purchase agreement, and was handled by the author who had the account. The roommates didn't have an agreement to split all items received, only the original TV. The author's decision to sell it as their own was reasonable, even if the roommate felt entitled due to contributing to the original purchase. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
