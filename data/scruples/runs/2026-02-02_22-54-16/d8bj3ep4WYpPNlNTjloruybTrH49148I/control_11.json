We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking a second TV that was delivered by accident and selling it.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates split the cost of a TV ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, a second TV arrives. The author claims it as their own, sells it, and the roommate is upset, demanding a share. The other roommate is fine.\n\nThe key points here are about ownership and prior agreements. The original TV was bought with shared funds, but the second one was an accident. The author thought the second TV was theirs because it was delivered to their address and they ordered the first. But the roommate argued they were entitled to a share.\n\nOwnership of the second TV isn't clear. Since it was a mistake by the seller, it's not clear if the author actually owns it. The original agreement was about splitting the cost of the first TV and future proceeds. The second TV is an unexpected item. If the author didn't intend to buy two, maybe the second was a free gift due to an error. In such cases, the seller might consider it a mistake and ask for a return, but that's up to them. However, the roommates might argue that since the purchase was a joint effort, any additional items should be handled jointly.\n\nThe author didn't consult the roommates before selling the second TV. Even if the author thought it was theirs, the fact that the original purchase was shared might imply shared responsibility for any errors. The roommate's anger comes from feeling entitled to a share, possibly thinking that the second TV is part of the group's property. \n\nThe author claims not to see the entitlement, but if the second TV was a result of the group's order (even if only the author placed it), the roommates might feel it's a shared asset. The author's action of selling without discussing could be seen as not considering the group's interests, hence being in the wrong. On the flip side, if the second TV was a mistake not intended by the seller, the author might not have a legal claim, but the ethical aspect is murkier. \n\nSince the author didn't check with the roommates and the purchase was a shared expense, not informing them might be a misstep. The answer depends on whether the second TV is considered an accidental delivery (possibly not owned) and whether the original agreement extended to such scenarios. The author's failure to communicate and the roommate's entitlement claim suggest that the author might be in the wrong for not consulting and possibly misjudging the ownership of the second TV.\n"
