We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered, even though it had their name on the order. The original TV was bought using their Amazon Prime, and they split the cost with two roommates. When a second TV showed up, the author decided to sell it, not sharing the profits with the roommates. The main point of contention is whether the roommates are entitled to a share of the money from the second TV.\n\nFirst, the original purchase: the cost was split three ways, so each paid 1/3. The author ordered it under their Amazon, but the expense was shared. The agreement was to split profits when selling later. Now, the second TV was an error. Since it was delivered to the house, but the author's name was on the order, it's likely the seller's mistake. The author didn't ask for two TVs; it's an accident. The key question is ownership of the second TV. \n\nThe author didn't include the roommates in the decision to sell the second TV. The roommate who tried to buy it thought it belonged to the author because it was under their name. The author sold it, and the other roommate was okay with it. The upset roommate is now demanding a share. \n\nLegally, if the second TV was a mistake, the seller might want it back, but if the author kept it, they might have become the owner. Since the original purchase was shared, maybe the roommates have a claim? Wait, the original purchase was split three ways, but the second TV was a free one. The roommates didn't contribute to the second TV's cost. So ethically, does the author have the right to the extra TV? \n\nThe author thought the roommates wouldn't be entitled to it. The original TV was bought by all, so splitting profits from selling it made sense. But the second TV was a free error, not part of the original purchase. The roommates didn't pay for it. Therefore, the author might not be obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV. The roommate's argument is that since they contributed to the original TV's cost, they should get a share of any profits, including from the second TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. \n\nThe author didn't misrepresent the situation when selling the second TV. The roommate tried to buy it from them, assuming it was theirs. So the author might not be in the wrong for keeping the proceeds. The key is whether the second TV's ownership was clear. Since it was delivered to the house but under the author's name, and the roommates didn't contribute to it, the author's claim to it is stronger. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a moral obligation to share the free TV since they were living together and shared the original TV's cost. But the original agreement was only about the original TV. The second TV was an unexpected error, not part of the shared purchase. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for keeping the second TV's profits. The answer is B (No).\n"
