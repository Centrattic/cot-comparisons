We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV, which was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime. Then, two TVs were delivered by mistake. The author decided to sell the second TV, and when a roommate found out, she was upset and demanded a share of the money. The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing by not sharing the profit.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was purchased with a split cost among three roommates, and there was an agreement about splitting profits if sold later. The second TV arrived by accident. The author thought it was their own to handle because it was ordered under their name and they didn't consider the roommates entitled to it. The other roommate was upset and felt entitled to a portion.\n\nI should consider the agreements made. The initial agreement was about the original TV. The second TV is an unexpected free item. The author ordered the original TV under their name, which might imply ownership, but since the cost was split, maybe there's a shared ownership aspect. However, the second TV was a mistake from Amazon, not part of the original purchase. The author might have a claim to it since it was delivered under their name, but roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a right to the second one as well.\n\nThe roommate who kept trying to buy the TV thought it was the author's, so the author sold it, thinking it was their own. The other roommate didn't have an issue. The problem is whether the author had the right to sell the second TV without considering the roommates' potential claim. \n\nLegally, if the second TV was a result of an error, it might belong to the person whose account was used, which is the author. However, ethically, since the roommates were part of the original purchase, maybe they should have been considered. The author thought they weren't entitled, but the roommate felt entitled. The question is whether the author should have shared the profit from the second TV. \n\nThe initial agreement was about the original TV. The second TV is an unexpected bonus. If the roommates didn't expect to get the second TV, then the author might be within their rights to take it. However, since the cost was split, perhaps there's an implied shared ownership in any additional items. The author's decision not to share the profit from the second TV might be seen as selfish, even if they didn't think they were obligated. \n\nBut the key here is that the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author might have a stronger claim because it was their account, but the roommates' contribution to the original purchase could imply they have a stake in any related items. However, since the second TV was a mistake, the author might be the rightful owner. \n\nThe roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled, but if there was no agreement about the second TV, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The author acted based on their understanding of ownership, while the roommate had different expectations. The author might not be in the wrong, but there could be a communication issue about expectations. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They had a reasonable claim to the second TV under their name, and the lack of prior agreement on the unexpected item means they aren't obligated to share the profits.\n"
