We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, with the cost split three ways. Then, two TVs were delivered, so the second one was sold, and the roommate who tried to buy it got upset when the author sold it instead of giving her a share.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the agreements made. The original plan was to split the cost of the TV and later split the profits from selling it. The author ordered the TV under their Amazon account, but the cost was shared. The second TV was an unexpected bonus. The key point here is whether the second TV was part of the original agreement.\n\nThe author mentions they thought the second TV was theirs to do with as they wanted. However, since the purchase was a joint decision and the cost was split, maybe the ownership of the second TV should also be shared. The roommates might reasonably expect that any unexpected gains from the purchase (like getting an extra TV for free) would be split as well. \n\nBut the author didn't see it that way. They thought because the original TV was ordered under their name, the second one automatically belonged to them. However, the initial agreement was that when moving out, they would split profits. The second TV wasn't part of the original purchase price; it was an error. So, maybe the second TV's ownership isn't clear. \n\nThe roommate was trying to buy it from the author, which the author turned down. Selling it themselves and not giving a share to the roommate might have been the problem. Even though the author felt it was their right, the roommate might have thought that since they contributed to the original purchase, they had a claim to the second TV as well.\n\nBut then again, the second TV wasn't paid for by anyone\u2014it was an error. The original purchase was split, but the second TV was free. The author could argue that it's their property since it was delivered to their address and they ordered it. However, the roommates might argue that the purchase was a shared decision, so the benefits should be shared.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the second TV was considered part of the original shared purchase. If the agreement was only for the first TV, then the second one could be the author's to handle. But if the shared agreement extended to any additional items from that purchase, then the author might be in the wrong for not splitting the profit.\n\nAlso, the roommate's reaction was intense, but the author didn't consider her expectations. Even if the author felt entitled, the roommates might have had a different understanding. The author didn't communicate clearly, leading to conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the roommates' potential claims to the second TV's proceeds, especially since the original purchase was a shared expense. Even though the author ordered it, the shared context complicates ownership of the bonus item. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the second TV was an error, not part of the original purchase. Hmm.\n"
