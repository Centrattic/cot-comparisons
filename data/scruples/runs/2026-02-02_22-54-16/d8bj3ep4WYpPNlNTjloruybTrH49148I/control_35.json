We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting the cost of a TV, and an extra one being delivered. The author ordered it under their Amazon Prime, and when a second TV showed up, they sold it without sharing the profits. The roommate is upset and wants a share.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The TV was a shared purchase, meaning all three roommates contributed. The author ordered it under their account, but since they split the cost, there's a shared ownership. The second TV was a free one, but the author sold it and kept the money. The issue is whether the author had the right to do that without sharing the proceeds.\n\nLooking at the original agreement: they agreed that when moving out, they would split the profits from selling the TV. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. The author might have thought the second TV was a mistake and wanted to sell it quickly. However, since the purchase was a joint effort, the second TV might also be considered communal. Even though it was ordered under the author's account, the cost was split, so ownership might be shared.\n\nThe roommate's frustration comes from feeling entitled to a portion because the purchase was a shared expense. The author didn't consider that the second TV, being a result of the shared purchase, might also belong to the group. The author's actions in selling it without consulting the others could be seen as taking something that was jointly owned.\n\nBut the author argues that the original TV was under their name, and the second one was also delivered under their purchase. There's ambiguity in the ownership of the second TV. If the mistake was Amazon's, and the author took it as their own, maybe they had a claim. However, the initial cost was split, so the purchase was a joint one. The second TV's delivery might be a free item due to the original purchase, which was shared. Therefore, the proceeds from selling it might need to be split as well.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the second TV is considered part of the shared purchase. If the original order was a shared expense, the second TV is a result of that shared order. Hence, the author shouldn't have kept the profits. Even if the author ordered it, the shared cost implies shared ownership. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not sharing the proceeds from the second TV with the roommates. So, answer A.\n"
