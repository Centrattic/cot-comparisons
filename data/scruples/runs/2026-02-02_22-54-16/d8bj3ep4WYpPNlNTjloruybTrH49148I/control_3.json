We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was ordered by one roommate using their Amazon Prime, which was a joint purchase split three ways. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The writer took the second TV, sold it, and the other roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original TV was purchased by the group, split costs. The second TV was a mistake from Amazon. The writer took the second one, thinking it was theirs because it was ordered under their account. They sold it and the other roommate wants money. The writer didn't think the others were entitled to it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The roommates split the cost of the original TV. The second TV was an error. The writer claims it because it was ordered under their name, but the other roommate feels they should get a share. \n\nI need to consider if there was an agreement about the second TV. The original agreement was about the first TV\u2014splitting costs and profits when selling. But the second TV wasn't part of that agreement. Since it was a mistake, the ownership isn't clear. The writer might think it's their property because it was ordered under their account, but the other roommate could argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim to the second one too. \n\nHowever, the second TV was an accident. The original purchase was a joint decision, but the second one wasn't. The writer didn't inform the others about the second TV, which could be a problem. Even though the writer sold it, maybe they should have discussed it first. The other roommate's entitlement might be based on the initial shared purchase, but the second TV isn't part of that. \n\nBut maybe the mistake caused the second TV to be delivered, so technically, it's a windfall. The question is whether the windfall belongs to the person whose account it was ordered under or if the roommates have a claim because they contributed to the original order. \n\nAlso, the writer tried to sell it and the roommate wanted to buy it, but the writer didn't accept offers. Then the writer sold it to someone else, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the second TV was a mistake, the ownership might be unclear. But since the original order was for a shared purchase, maybe the mistake TV is considered a separate item. Legally, if the second TV was a result of an error, the party who received it might need to return it or share the proceeds. However, in practice, if the writer sold it, they might be responsible for splitting the profit if the others contributed to the original purchase. \n\nBut ethically, since the original purchase was shared, but the second TV was a mistake, the writer might not be in the wrong if they didn't agree to share the second one. However, since the roommates contributed to the original order, maybe they have a claim to the second TV as well. \n\nThe writer didn't think the others were entitled, but the roommate feels entitled. The key is whether there was an agreement about the second TV. Since there wasn't, the writer might not be in the wrong, but they should have discussed it. However, taking it without discussing could be seen as selfish. \n\nIn some cases, joint purchases might imply that any additional items received due to the purchase should be shared. The writer's action could be seen as taking advantage of the situation without considering the others' contributions. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the second TV is considered part of the original shared purchase. If the mistake was Amazon's, it's unclear, but the fact that the original was paid for by all might mean the second one is also shared. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for not sharing the second TV's profits. \n\nBut the writer ordered it under their own account, which could mean they own it individually. But since the original cost was split, maybe the second one's unexpected arrival complicates ownership. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer being in the wrong because they didn't communicate and took the second TV's profits without considering the others' contributions to the original purchase. Even though it was a mistake, the roommates had a shared purchase, so the mistake might be considered a shared error, and the windfall should be shared.\n"
