We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a TV order that resulted in two TVs. The main points are: they split the cost of the original TV, the second TV was delivered by accident, the author took it and sold it, and one roommate got angry about not getting a cut.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, even though the cost was split. The second TV was a free one, maybe a mistake by Amazon. The author decided to sell the second TV without consulting the roommates. The problem seems to be about ownership of the second TV. The roommates contributed to the original purchase, so maybe they have a claim to the free TV as well? \n\nThe author believed the second TV was theirs because it was under their name. But if the purchase was a joint decision, even if paid individually, maybe the free item is part of the shared purchase. The roommates might feel that since they helped pay for the original, any additional items from that purchase should be shared. The author didn't consider that, leading to conflict.\n\nAlso, the roommate who tried to buy it from the author might have felt ownership over the free TV. However, the author sold it without consulting everyone. Even if the original TV was under the author's name, the free TV might be considered part of the same transaction, which was a group decision. So the author might be at fault for not discussing the free TV's ownership with the roommates first. But the other roommate didn't have issues, which complicates things. \n\nThe key issue is whether the free TV was a result of the shared purchase. If the roommates contributed to the original cost, the free TV might be considered a shared asset. The author's assumption that they alone owned the free TV could be the mistake. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not splitting the proceeds from the free TV.\n"
