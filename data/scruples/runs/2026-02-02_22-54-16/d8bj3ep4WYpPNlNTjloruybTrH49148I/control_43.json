We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates buying a TV together, splitting the cost, and then a second TV being delivered by accident. The author ordered the TV under their Amazon Prime, which was discounted. They ended up keeping and selling the second TV, which led to conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, the original TV was bought by the author under their account, even though the cost was split three ways. The second TV was an error, and the author took it, thinking it was theirs. The key points here are ownership of the original purchase and the unexpected second item. The author sold the second TV without consulting the roommates, leading to the roommate's anger.\n\nThe author mentions that the original agreement was to split profits if they sold the original TV later. But the second TV was a free bonus. The question is whether the author was entitled to it solely or if the roommates had a claim. Since the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, it's unclear if the roommates had any right to it. The author might have assumed they owned the second TV because it was delivered to their name, but the cost was split. However, the initial purchase was a joint decision, so maybe the second TV should have been considered communal property.\n\nThe roommate's frustration comes from feeling entitled to a share because the original purchase was a shared expense. But the second TV wasn't part of the original plan. The author might have made a mistake by not considering that the roommates could feel they had a stake in any additional items from the purchase. Even if the second TV was a mistake, the fact that the original cost was split might imply that the roommates expect any unexpected gains to be shared. The author didn't communicate with the roommates about the second TV, which led to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve the roommates in the decision to keep and sell the second TV, even though the original purchase was shared. The roommates might have a claim to the second TV because the initial purchase was a joint effort, even if it was ordered under one person's account. The author should have discussed the second TV with the roommates first to reach an agreement rather than assuming ownership. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
