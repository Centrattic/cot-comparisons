We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a TV that was split costs among three roommates. The main issue is that an extra TV was delivered by Amazon, and the person sold it without splitting the profit with the other roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, and the cost was split three ways. When two TVs arrived, the author decided to sell the second one. The roommate kept trying to buy it but was turned down. Eventually, the author sold it to someone else, and the other roommate is upset about not getting a share of the money.\n\nNow, considering the roommates' agreement. They agreed to split the cost of the original TV, and any profits from selling it later. But the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The author ordered the TV with their own account, so maybe they had the right to the second TV. However, since the original purchase cost was split, does that affect ownership of the extra TV?\n\nThe key point here is whether the second TV is considered a return or a mistake. If Amazon sent two TVs by accident, the second one might belong to the person who ordered it, even if the cost was shared. So the author might have the right to keep or sell it. However, the roommates might feel entitled because they contributed to the original purchase, even if it was a mistake.\n\nAnother angle: the roommates might not have been aware of the mistake until later. The author didn't inform them about the second TV immediately. They made decisions without consulting the others, which could be seen as selfish. Even though the author thought they were doing a nice thing by selling it, not involving the others might lead to conflict.\n\nBut legally, if the TV was ordered under the author's name, they might own it. However, morally, since the roommates paid part of the original cost, there might be an expectation that any unexpected gains (like the second TV) would be shared. The author didn't consider their roommates' contributions beyond the initial purchase. The roommate who tried to buy it might have thought that if it was a shared purchase, the extra TV should be a shared gain.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not communicating with the roommates about the second TV. Even if they had the right to sell it, not discussing it led to conflict. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original cost, and the author didn't consider that their contribution might imply shared ownership of any additional items.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not be legally wrong, ethically they might be at fault for not involving their roommates in the decision-making process. The answer would depend on whether the roommates had an agreement about such scenarios, which they don't seem to have. So, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not considering their roommates' contributions and expectations.\n"
