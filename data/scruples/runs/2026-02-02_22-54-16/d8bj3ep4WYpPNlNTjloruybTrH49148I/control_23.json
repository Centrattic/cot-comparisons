We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house with their name on it, and then selling it without splitting the profits with their roommate. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The person bought a TV with two roommates, splitting the cost three ways. They ordered it under their Amazon Prime because it was discounted. When a second TV arrived, they thought it was a mistake and decided to sell it. The roommate kept trying to buy it from them, but they refused and eventually sold it. The roommate got angry and demanded a share of the money. The other roommate didn't have an issue.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the package was addressed to the author and delivered to their residence, they might have a claim to it, especially if the other roommates didn't have their names on the order. However, since they all contributed to the original purchase, there might be shared ownership. But the second TV was an accident, so maybe it's the seller's error. If the seller sent an extra item by mistake, the rightful owner might be the one who paid for the original. However, the roommates also paid for the original TV, so they might have a claim to the second one if it's considered part of the purchase error.\n\nEthically, the roommates might feel that since they all contributed to the original purchase, any errors or bonuses should be split among them. The author didn't consult with the others, leading to the roommates feeling entitled. The author's argument is that they ordered it and sold it, and the other roommate was only approaching them, implying ownership.\n\nBut here's a catch: when you buy something with others, even if it's ordered under one person's account, the shared payment could imply shared ownership. However, the original agreement was about splitting costs and profits upon selling. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. But since it's an error, maybe the author should have informed everyone and decided together. By not doing so, they might have acted unilaterally.\n\nAlso, the roommate felt entitled to a share because they contributed to the original purchase. Even though the second TV was a mistake, the roommates might argue that the error was due to the original order, so they have a right to a portion. The author didn't see it that way, which could be the crux of the issue.\n\nIn legal terms, if the seller sent an extra item by mistake, the rightful recipient might be the one who paid for the order. However, since the roommates paid part of the original cost, there's a shared investment. The author might have a stronger claim if the order was solely theirs, but the shared cost complicates it.\n\nEthically, transparency is important. The author didn't consult their roommates before selling the second TV, which led to the conflict. Even if they had the right to sell it, not discussing it with the others might have been the main issue. The roommate's anger comes from feeling left out of the decision.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, there's a split. Legally, maybe the author is in the right because the package was under their name. Ethically, maybe not, because the roommates contributed to the original purchase and weren't involved in the decision. The answer might depend on the perspective: if the author had discussed the second TV's handling with the roommates, there wouldn't be a conflict. Since they didn't, it's a problem.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving the roommates in the decision, even if they had the right to the TV. The entitlement the roommate felt stems from their contribution to the original purchase, so the author should have considered that.\n"
