We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident. Let's break down the details.\n\nSo, the author moved in with two roommates and they bought a TV together, splitting the cost. They used the author's Amazon Prime for a discounted purchase. They had an agreement that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was the same model but a different brand. The author thought they could sell the second one, maybe kept it as their own. The other roommate kept trying to buy it, but the author sold it instead. The roommate got upset, thinking she was entitled to a share of the money.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement. They split the cost of the original TV, so the original TV is a shared purchase. But the second TV was an accident. The author didn't split the cost of the second one; it was just sent by mistake. The original TV was paid for with a shared expense, but the second one wasn't part of that agreement. The author ordered the TV under their own Amazon account, so maybe the second TV was considered a separate item. However, since they all contributed to the original purchase, does that mean the second TV is also a shared property? Or since it was a mistake and the author didn't order it, it's their responsibility to handle it?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the second TV was a mistake, they could claim it because it was delivered under their name. But the roommate thought it was part of the initial shared purchase. The problem is that the author didn't clarify with the roommates before selling it. Even though the original agreement was about splitting profits from selling the original TV, the second one wasn't part of that. However, the roommates might argue that since they shared the cost of the original, they might expect the same for the second. But the author didn't split the cost of the second TV. It was an error, so the author didn't pay for it, so they might have the right to keep it. \n\nBut maybe the roommates could argue that since they were part of the original purchase, they should be informed about any additional items. The author didn't consult them, which led to the conflict. The roommate who was upset felt entitled because she thought the second TV was part of their shared purchase. However, the original agreement was about the TV they paid for. The second TV was an error, not part of the original agreement. So the author isn't obligated to share the money from the second TV because they didn't share the cost for it. The problem is that the author didn't communicate properly and acted unilaterally. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they didn't break the original agreement because the second TV wasn't part of it. On the other hand, maybe they should have discussed with roommates before selling it, especially since it's in the house they share. The author might have assumed it was their own because it was delivered under their name, but in a shared living situation, property is a bit ambiguous. However, since the second TV was a mistake, the author might have the right to handle it. The other roommate's anger might be unwarranted, but the author could have handled the situation better by discussing it first. \n\nBut according to the initial agreement, they only split the cost of the original TV. The second TV was an accident, so the author isn't obligated to share the profits from that. The author didn't include the roommates in the purchase of the second TV. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
