We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they moved in with two roommates, bought a TV together, split the cost. Then Amazon sent a second TV for free. The author took that second TV, sold it, and now one roommate is upset, demanding her share of the money.\n\nFirst, the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. That part seems clear. The issue arises with the second TV. The author thought it was theirs to handle, but the roommate argues they should have shared the proceeds.\n\nSo, was the second TV a mistake? The user says it was accidentally delivered. So Amazon sent an extra one. Now, if it was a mistake, does that mean the author was entitled to keep it? Well, if they didn't order it, maybe they shouldn't have kept it. But the author might not have known it was a mistake. However, since they did receive it, they might have had to return it or share it.\n\nThe author sold the second TV and gave no money to the roommate. The roommate argues that since they split the cost of the original TV, they should have a share of the second one. But the original agreement was about splitting the cost and splitting profits when selling. The second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. But the roommate might feel that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim on the second one.\n\nBut wait, the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase. It was an error. So maybe the author is right to think they can do with it as they please. However, if the second TV was due to the original order, perhaps the roommates have a claim because they paid part of the original order. But the second TV was free, not an additional charge. Hmm.\n\nThe problem is that the author didn't consult the roommates about the second TV. They just took it and sold it. The roommate who tried to buy it was persistent, but the author refused. Then sold it to someone else. The other roommate had no issues, but the other one is upset.\n\nSo, the key points are: the original purchase was split, but the second TV was a mistake. The author ordered it under their Amazon, but the cost was split. The second TV wasn't ordered, but received by accident. The author sold it without consulting everyone. The roommate argues they should get a share because they contributed to the original purchase. The author argues they didn't owe them anything since the second TV was an accident and not part of the original agreement.\n\nPossible angles: since the second TV was a mistake, maybe it's not the roommates' to claim. But if the original purchase was a joint decision, maybe the benefits (including any errors) should be shared. Also, the fact that the author used their Amazon account might imply they had control, but the cost was split. So maybe there's an expectation of shared ownership in any additional benefits?\n\nAnother angle: when the author ordered the TV under their own account, they might have taken responsibility for the order, and any errors in delivery. So if the second TV was a mistake, maybe the author is responsible to handle it properly, perhaps returning it or sharing the proceeds. Since the roommates contributed to the original purchase, maybe they have a right to a share of the second TV's proceeds as well.\n\nBut the author might argue that the second TV was an error, not part of the original purchase, so they can keep it. However, if the original purchase was shared, maybe the error is still a shared mistake. Alternatively, since the author ordered it under their account, they might have been the only one responsible for the order, hence entitled to the second TV.\n\nThis is tricky. The author's position is that the second TV was theirs to handle since it was their order. The roommate's position is that since they paid part of the original cost, they should share in any benefits, including the second TV.\n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the second TV was an error, the fact that the original purchase was shared might mean that any unexpected benefits (like an extra TV) should be shared. The author might have thought they could handle it alone, but maybe they should have discussed it with the roommates first.\n\nSo, considering that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult the roommates about the second TV, especially since the original purchase was shared. The roommate's argument that they contributed to the original cost and thus should share in the proceeds of the second TV could have merit. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering their roommates' contributions when handling the second TV.\n"
