We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates bought a TV together, split the cost, and agreed on splitting profits if they sold it later. The main person ordered it under their Amazon Prime because there was a discount. Then, Amazon delivered two TVs. The second one was identical in features but a different brand. The person decided to sell the second TV, and while their roommate wanted to buy it, the person sold it and now the roommate is upset, claiming they should get a share of the money.\n\nThe key points here are the ownership of the second TV. The original TV was ordered under the main person's account, but the cost was split. But the second TV was an accidental delivery. The main person assumed it was theirs to sell because it was delivered with their name, and they didn't consider the roommates' entitlement. The roommate felt entitled because they contributed to the original purchase.\n\nNow, legally, if the second TV was a mistake by the seller, it might be considered the property of the person whose name is on the account, which is the main person. So selling it might be their right. However, the roommates might argue that since they contributed to the original purchase, they have a claim over both TVs. But the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase; it was an error. So maybe the main person isn't obligated to share the proceeds from the second TV since it wasn't part of the cost they all split.\n\nBut the problem is the agreement. The original agreement was about the TV they bought. The second TV wasn't part of that agreement. The main person might have assumed ownership of the second TV because it was delivered under their name, but the roommates might feel that since they all contributed to the original purchase, any additional item resulting from that order is communal property. However, the second TV was an error, so it's unclear if the seller intended to send two. The main person might have acted in good faith by selling the second TV since it was an unexpected item under their account.\n\nThe roommate's anger seems to stem from a misunderstanding of ownership. If the second TV wasn't part of the original purchase, even though they split the cost, the additional item might not be their responsibility to share. The main person didn't do anything wrong here. They acted within their rights to sell an item that was mistakenly delivered to them, especially since it wasn't explicitly agreed upon to share the proceeds. The confusion might be because the roommate thought the second TV was part of the original purchase, but it wasn't. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
