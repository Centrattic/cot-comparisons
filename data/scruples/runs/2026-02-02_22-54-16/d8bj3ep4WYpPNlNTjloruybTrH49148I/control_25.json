We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a TV that was accidentally delivered twice, and the author sold the second one without splitting the profits with a roommate.\n\nFirst, the TV was originally ordered by the author under their Amazon Prime account, but the cost was split three ways. So even though it was ordered under their account, the cost was shared. The second TV came for free, and the author decided to sell it. The main issue is whether the profit from the sold TV should be split since it was a result of a shared purchase.\n\nThe roommates had agreed that when moving out, they would split the profits from selling the original TV. The second TV was a free one, but since the original purchase was shared, maybe the second one's ownership isn't entirely the author's. Even though the author ordered it, the initial expense was shared, so the windfall might be considered a shared benefit.\n\nThe other roommate felt entitled to a portion because the original cost was split. The author didn't think they were entitled, but maybe they should have considered that since the purchase was a joint decision. The free TV came as a result of their shared expense, so splitting the profit might be fair. The author's action of not sharing the profit could be seen as taking more than their fair share, making them at fault.\n"
