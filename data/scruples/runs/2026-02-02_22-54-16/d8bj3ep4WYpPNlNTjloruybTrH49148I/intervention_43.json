We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their house. The main points are:\n\n1. The original TV was bought under the author's Amazon Prime account, and the cost was split three ways with roommates. The agreement was that when they move out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits.\n\n2. Amazon delivered two TVs by mistake. The second one is a different brand but same specs. The author decided to sell it and gave the money to a third party. Another roommate was upset and demanded her share, while the other roommate wasn't.\n\nThe key factors here are the ownership of the original TV and the second TV. Since the original was purchased through the author's account, even though the cost was split, the ownership might be more ambiguous. However, the second TV was a mistake by Amazon. The author might have a claim to it because it was delivered to their account.\n\nThe roommates might argue that since the cost was split for the first TV, they have a shared ownership in the purchase, so the second TV could be considered a shared asset. But since the second TV was an error, the owner of the original purchase (the author) might have the right to it. However, the author didn't inform the roommates about the second TV before selling it, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe roommate who tried to buy the TV thought it was the author's, which supports the author's claim. The other roommate didn't have an issue, so maybe the conflict is only between two people. The author might be in the right if they owned the original purchase and the second TV was a mistake, but if the roommates had a shared ownership agreement, maybe not. But the original agreement was about the first TV; the second TV wasn't part of that. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
