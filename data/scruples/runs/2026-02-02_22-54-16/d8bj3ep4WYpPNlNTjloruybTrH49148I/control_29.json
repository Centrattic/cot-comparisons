We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered to their shared house. The key points here are about shared purchases and ownership.\n\nFirst, the TV was ordered by the author using their Amazon Prime, but the cost was split three ways. So even though the author placed the order, the payment was shared. The initial agreement was that if they moved out, they'd sell the TV and split the profits. Now, when a second TV arrives, the author assumed it was theirs and sold it without consulting the others. \n\nThe problem arises because the second TV might be considered an error by the seller. Since the original purchase was a shared expense, the second item, even if it came with the same name, could be considered a windfall for all roommates. The author didn't check if the second TV was a mistake or if it belonged to someone else, which might be an oversight. However, since the TV was delivered to their address and had the author's name, it's plausible they thought it was theirs.\n\nThe other roommate's fury comes from feeling entitled to a share of the proceeds. Since the original purchase was split, maybe there's an expectation that any bonuses from the purchase (like an extra TV) would also be shared. The author didn't consider this, possibly leading to the conflict. But the other roommate approached the author specifically, indicating they thought it was the author's TV. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the second TV was a mistake and if the original agreement included shared ownership of any extra items. If the author acted in good faith and the second TV was intended for them, then maybe not. But if the second TV was a mistake and the error should have been reported, the author might have an obligation to return it. However, since they sold it and the roommate is now upset, there's a possible breach of the implied shared ownership from the original purchase. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in not considering that the second TV might be a windfall for all roommates. Even though the purchase was under their name, the shared cost implies shared responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the delivery was under their name. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) since the TV was delivered to them and they didn't know it was a mistake. Hmm.\n"
