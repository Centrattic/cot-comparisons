We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves a TV ordered by one roommate (the author) under their Amazon Prime, split in cost with two roommates. Then, Amazon delivered a second TV by mistake. The author decided to sell the second TV and kept the proceeds, leading to a conflict with one roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The original TV was purchased with the author's Amazon account, but the cost was split three ways. The agreement was that when moving out, they'd sell the TV and split profits. The second TV, a free one, was delivered by accident. The author assumed it was theirs because it was under their name and sold it without consulting the roommates.\n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the second TV, the initial agreement about shared purchases, and whether the roommates had a right to the second TV's proceeds. The author ordered the TV, so maybe they have a claim to it. However, since the cost was split, the roommates might feel they contributed to the purchase and thus share in any extra items received. But Amazon's mistake could complicate things. If the second TV was a delivery error, the author might be the rightful recipient since it was under their name. \n\nThe roommate who got angry felt entitled to a share of the money from the second TV's sale. But if the TV was a mistake, the author might not owe them anything. The other roommate didn't have issues, so maybe the problem is only with one person. \n\nThe author didn't consider the roommate's feelings, but if there was no prior agreement about the bonus item, the author might not be in the wrong. However, since the cost was shared, maybe there's an expectation of shared ownership in any errors related to the purchase. But the original purchase was under the author's account. The second TV might be considered a gift to the person whose account it was ordered under. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the roommates had a right to the second TV. If the TV was a mistake, the author's account owner might have sole rights. The author isn't in the wrong if there was no agreement to split the bonus item. However, if the roommates felt they contributed to the purchase, there could be an argument for sharing. But the original agreement was about the original TV, not any extras. The author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
