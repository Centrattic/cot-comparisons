We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for claiming a second TV that was delivered by accident and then selling it. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author and two roommates bought a TV together, splitting the cost. They ordered it using the author's Amazon Prime, which had a discount. They agreed on selling the TV when they move out and splitting the profits. Then, the delivery had two TVs. The author thought the second one was theirs and sold it, leading to a dispute with one roommate.\n\nSo, the key points are: the TV was ordered by the author, but the cost was split. The second TV was an error. The author sold it, and one roommate is upset because they feel entitled to a share. The author didn't consider the roommate's entitlement.\n\nHmm, the main issue is whether the second TV, which was a mistake, became the group's property or the author's. Since the original purchase was a shared expense, maybe the second TV is also a shared asset? Or since it was delivered to their shared house and the author's name was on the order, maybe the author had the right to it?\n\nBut wait, the original TV was bought with shared funds. The second TV was a free one, but was it also part of the shared purchase? The author ordered it under their Amazon, but the cost was split. If the second TV was an error, maybe it was considered a mistake by Amazon, and the author might have an obligation to return it or share the proceeds. However, the author sold it, assuming it was theirs.\n\nThe roommate argued that since they split the original cost, they should share the proceeds. But the author didn't see it that way. The problem is that the second TV wasn't part of the original agreement. The original agreement was about the TV they ordered, not the accidental one. But maybe the accidental delivery makes it a separate incident.\n\nWait, but if the delivery was an error, the ownership might be unclear. The author received it, but since they were ordering the first TV, maybe the second was a mistake, and they should have returned it. Selling it without consulting roommates could be the issue. Even though the author thought it was theirs, the fact that it was a mistake might mean it belonged to the company, or the group might have a claim.\n\nThe author didn't involve the roommates in the decision to sell the second TV. That's probably where the mistake is. The original purchase was shared, so maybe the second TV's ownership wasn't clear. The author should have discussed with roommates before selling. Even if the second TV was under the author's name, since the delivery was at a shared house, it's possible the roommates had a claim.\n\nThe answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not considering the roommates' potential claim to the second TV, especially since the original purchase was shared. Even if the second TV was a mistake, the proceeds from selling it could be considered shared property, given the circumstances.\n"
