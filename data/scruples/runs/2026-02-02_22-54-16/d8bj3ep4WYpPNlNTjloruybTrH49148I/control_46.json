We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about claiming a second TV that was accidentally delivered. The key points are that the original TV was ordered under the author's Amazon Prime as part of a shared purchase split with two roommates. Then, a second TV arrived, and the author decided to sell it. The roommate who tried to buy it was upset when it was sold to someone else, demanding her share of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author had a right to claim the second TV. The original agreement was that they split the cost of the TV, and any profits from selling it later would be split three ways. The second TV was a mistake, but since it was sent to the house and had the author's name on it, maybe it's considered their property? But since the purchase was shared, perhaps the roommates have a claim as well?\n\nThe author ordered the TV under their Amazon account, but the purchase was part of a shared expense. So the initial TV was a joint purchase. The second TV might be considered a result of an error, but does that make it the author's to keep? If the error was Amazon's fault, maybe the author is responsible for returning it or sharing the value. The roommate who tried to buy it thought it was the author's, so maybe the author had the right to sell it. However, since the original purchase was split, maybe the second TV's value should be shared among roommates too.\n\nThe author didn't consider splitting the second TV's proceeds, which led to conflict. The question is whether the author had the right to sell the second TV without consulting the roommates. If the second TV was a result of the original shared purchase, maybe all roommates have a claim to it. Even though it was in the author's name, the initial purchase was split, so perhaps the author should have discussed the second TV's handling with everyone.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that the second TV's value could be shared. They assumed it was entirely theirs to sell, but since the original purchase was a shared expense, the roommates might have a right to a portion of the second TV's proceeds. The roommate's anger stems from feeling entitled to a share, which the author didn't consider. That suggests the author made a mistake in not sharing the value of the second TV.\n"
