Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his ex-girlfriend have been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for their apartment alone, and they've always emphasized trust because they've been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she announced only a few days before leaving. The author felt blindsided, asked if he could come, but she refused, saying he wouldn't let her go. He then kicked her out of the apartment, leading to her going to her parents' house and people calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The apartment is paid for by him, and she doesn't contribute financially. They've always been open and trusted each other. She planned a solo trip she had been planning for months but didn't tell him. He was upset and gave her an ultimatum: leave or he'd kick her out. She chose to leave, and he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Communication is a big factor here. If she had planned the trip for months, why didn't she tell him earlier? Maybe she thought she could handle it alone, or maybe she didn't consider his feelings. The fact that he pays for the apartment and she's not contributing financially might be a point. But relationships require mutual respect and communication. If she decided to go on a solo trip, maybe she should have discussed it with him when she was planning it, not just when it was about to happen. \n\nHe responded by kicking her out, which is a drastic measure. Even if he was upset, giving her an ultimatum might be seen as extreme. However, considering he pays for the apartment, he might feel that her decision to leave without notice or prior discussion is a betrayal of trust. But is it his right to kick her out? If they are in a shared apartment, even if he's the sole payer, typically both parties have a right to live there unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. So maybe that's where he's being criticized as controlling.\n\nAlso, the people around him called him a controlling asshole, which might indicate that his reaction was seen as harsh. But if there was a lack of communication from her side, maybe he felt justified. However, relationships often require compromise. If she wanted to go on a trip, maybe a middle ground could have been reached, like her staying with her parents during the trip instead of him kicking her out immediately.\n\nAnother angle: the emphasis on trust. They said they were big on trust, so maybe expecting her to communicate her plans earlier is reasonable. But if she felt she had to keep it a secret to avoid conflict, that's a problem in communication. His reaction was to end the relationship, which might be valid if he couldn't handle the lack of communication, but the method of kicking her out might be too sudden.\n\nIn conclusion, the key points are communication failure on her part and an overly harsh reaction from him. He might feel justified, but his action of kicking her out without prior discussion could be seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his reaction was too extreme, even if her lack of communication was an issue.\n"
