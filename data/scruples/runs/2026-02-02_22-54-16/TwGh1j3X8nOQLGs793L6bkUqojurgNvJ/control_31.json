Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the context: they were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment himself, and they have a system where she compensates him for her share of the utilities. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. He didn't know about it until days before she left. He asked to come along, but she said no, saying he wouldn't allow her to go alone. The argument led to him telling her she could leave his house, and she did, going to her parents. Now people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here. Did she have a right to plan this trip without telling him? She said he wouldn't have let her go if she told him. He didn't know, so maybe there was a lack of communication. However, she did mention she had been planning it for months. If she had planned it for months, why didn't she talk to him earlier? That's a red flag. Also, the fact that he paid for the apartment, but she was staying there. He told her she could leave, which she did. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't make her leave immediately; he gave her a week's notice to find a hotel. But he's the one who decided to break up by kicking her out. In a relationship, both partners should communicate important plans, especially if they affect the other person. Her keeping such a big decision secret for months could be a breach of trust. However, his reaction was to kick her out rather than talk it through. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries or why she didn't consult him. But given that they had issues with trust before, maybe he felt justified in ending it if he thought she was being dishonest. On the other hand, if she had planned it for months, not telling him could be a major issue. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. He's not wrong for wanting honesty, but his method might be harsh. However, considering the context of their past trust issues and her secrecy, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But it's possible that he could have handled it better without immediately breaking up over it. Alternatively, the fact that he provided the apartment and she didn't contribute financially, maybe he felt more entitled to control the living situation. But that's a tricky point. In any case, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't address the issue calmly, but given her secrecy, maybe B (not in the wrong). Hmm. It's a tough call. I think the key is whether her actions violated their trust and the terms they had. If she was honest about her plans and just wanted to go, maybe he overreacted. But if she kept it secret, then he's justified. But the problem is that she said she had been planning it for months, which means she could have talked to him earlier. So, maybe he's not wrong for ending it because of the lack of communication, but his method was harsh. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. So, considering all factors, I think the answer is A because he didn't handle it properly, but maybe B because she violated trust. Wait, the user is the one who asked if he's in the wrong. Given that, I need to decide. If the community considers that kicking someone out of the house is too harsh, then A. If they think her secrecy is the issue, then B. But in many cases, sudden breakups over major issues can be seen as justified if there's a breach of trust. However, the way he did it was abrupt. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), because she didn't communicate her plans, which was a breach of trust, and he had the right to end the relationship if he felt it was a deal-breaker. But if the main issue is the lack of communication, then he's not wrong for ending it. So, the answer is B.\n"
