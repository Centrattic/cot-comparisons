Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider several factors.\n\nFirst, context is important. The couple has been together for three years, and the author pays for the apartment. They have an agreement where the girlfriend contributes to the bills, but the author covers the main cost. There's a history of trust issues because both have been in relationships where they were cheated on. Trust is a big part of their relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend decided to go on a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. The author didn't know until she told him a few days before the trip. He asked if he could join, but she refused, saying it was about self-discovery. She didn't tell him earlier because she thought he wouldn't agree. The author then told her she could leave the apartment, which she did, moving to her parents' house.\n\nNow, the key points here: communication, trust, and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip until last minute, even though she had planned it for months. This could be seen as a breach of trust, especially given their emphasis on open communication. The author felt that since she didn't contribute to the apartment costs, she didn't have a right to stay there. But wait, he said they split the bills through a meter, so maybe she did contribute part of it. However, the author is the one paying the main share.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out, which seems extreme. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, they were in a committed relationship. Ending it because of a disagreement over a trip might be a harsh reaction. The girlfriend's right to make her own decisions, especially about travel, might be important here. But the timing and lack of communication could be problematic.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't have the right to stay if she wasn't contributing financially. But the apartment is shared, and she was living there. Maybe the issue is more about the sudden trip and not the financial arrangement. The author might be overreacting by ending the relationship immediately after an argument.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends are calling him controlling, which adds another layer. People might see his reaction as excessive. However, given the trust issues, maybe he felt that her secret trip was a betrayal. But she did explain her reasons, and he still chose to end the relationship, which could be seen as too hasty.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, but the author's response might be too extreme. Ending a three-year relationship because of a disagreement over a trip, even if it's a surprise, could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The financial aspect is a bit of a red herring here. The core issue is communication and handling the conflict. The author's ultimatum might be controlling, as he's using the apartment as a leverage point. That could be where he's wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate and controlling. The girlfriend had the right to make her own decisions, even if he disagreed. The way he ended the relationship was extreme, especially without addressing the underlying issues through better communication. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
