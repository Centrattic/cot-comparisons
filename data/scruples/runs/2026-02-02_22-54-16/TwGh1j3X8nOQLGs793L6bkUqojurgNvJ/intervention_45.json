Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by dumping their girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, context is important. They were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment, which is a two-bedroom. They have a system where the girlfriend compensates him for her usage. The girlfriend had been planning a solo trip for months but didn't tell him, saying he wouldn't approve. She wanted to \"discover herself\" alone. The author, feeling disrespected and maybe hurt, told her she could leave, since she didn't pay for the apartment. She went to her parents' house, and people are calling him controlling.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the dynamics. The author mentions trust is a big part of their relationship. If she didn't communicate her plans, that's a problem. He had the right to set boundaries, especially since he's the one paying for the house. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out five days before she was leaving\u2014might have been harsh. But given that they were in a serious relationship, expecting her to be upfront about a major trip is reasonable. Also, she admitted she didn't tell him because he wouldn't approve, which shows a lack of transparency. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship because she broke trust seems justified. If trust is a cornerstone of their relationship, then her actions could be seen as a breach. However, ending a relationship so quickly after an argument might be seen as impulsive. But considering the importance of trust and her dishonesty, maybe he had a right to be upset. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his reaction was too extreme, especially since she was going on the trip regardless. But since he's the one paying for the apartment and they value trust, him standing his ground makes sense. He's not the one who left; she chose to leave after he set the boundary. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the girlfriend's lack of communication was a major issue. The author had the right to expect her to be honest, especially about something planned for months. His response, while abrupt, stems from a place of feeling disrespected. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
