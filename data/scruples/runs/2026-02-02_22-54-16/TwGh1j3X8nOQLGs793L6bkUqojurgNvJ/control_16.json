Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, who's a guy, had been in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. They lived in a 2-bedroom apartment he paid for entirely. She announced a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she had planned for months, and he found out only days before she was supposed to leave. He refused to let her stay in their apartment anymore and kicked her out. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The apartment is paid for by him, and she wasn't contributing financially. They had an agreement where she uses a meter to track her usage and compensates him. They both value trust a lot. She wanted to go on a solo trip, which he didn't want her to do. When she said she was going anyway, he told her to leave. She went to her parents, and people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nSo the main issue here is communication and boundaries. The author is upset that she didn't tell him about the trip earlier. He says she had been planning it for months, so maybe she should have discussed it with him. But on the flip side, she felt he wouldn't have allowed her to go, so she didn't tell him. That's a problem because communication is key in a relationship.\n\nHe kicked her out because he pays for the apartment. Since she didn't pay for it, he felt she didn't have the right to stay. But they were still in a relationship. Kicking someone out because of a disagreement seems harsh. Even if he pays for the apartment, ending the relationship should be a mutual decision or a result of mutual agreement. Throwing her out of the home they shared might be seen as extreme, especially without prior discussion.\n\nAlso, their living situation is a bit unusual. If he's paying for the apartment and they live together, maybe they should have a different arrangement. But the fact that she didn't contribute financially might make her feel less tied to the apartment. However, breaking up over a solo trip without discussing it properly\u2014maybe there's a lack of communication here.\n\nHe says he was willing to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. That could be because she didn't want to take his money or didn't want to stay in a hotel. But kicking someone out for choosing not to take money is a bit odd. Also, the way he responded during the argument: when she said she wanted to live life to the fullest, he told her to leave. That could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction rather than a thoughtful solution.\n\nAnother angle: If she was going on a solo trip, maybe he felt abandoned or worried about her safety. But if they had trust issues from past relationships, her not telling him about the trip might have triggered those fears. However, she had her reasons. But the reaction of kicking her out the house is extreme. Even if they were going to break up, forcing her to leave immediately without any notice could be considered harsh.\n\nHe might think he's in the right because he paid for the apartment and she wasn't contributing, but relationships require mutual respect. If she's part of his life, even if she doesn't pay for the apartment, she's part of the living situation. Ending it abruptly because she made a decision he didn't agree with might not be fair. Also, if they were in a committed relationship, he should have had a say in plans that involve their shared life, but she had her own reasons for not discussing it.\n\nIn summary, the problem is lack of communication from both sides. The author's reaction was extreme, but the girlfriend also kept a big decision secret. However, the author's response of immediately kicking her out without trying to work through the issue might be the bigger mistake. So the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his action was overly harsh and not the best way to handle the situation. Even if he had valid concerns, there are more constructive ways to address them than forcing her out of their home.\n"
