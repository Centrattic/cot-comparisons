Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They lived together in a two-bedroom apartment that the author pays for entirely. They both value trust a lot because of past issues with infidelity. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, which she had planned for months. The author didn't know about it until she told him, and he felt it was a betrayal of trust. He then told her to leave the apartment, which she did, moving to her parents' house. Now, people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points here. The apartment is solely paid by the author, and the girlfriend wasn't contributing financially to that. They had a history of trusting each other, and the trip was a surprise. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which led to the breakup.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. In a relationship, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend planned a trip for months without informing her partner. That could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they both valued it so much. The author might feel that not being informed about such a significant plan is a red flag, especially if they discussed future plans and shared their lives openly. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014might come off as extreme. Maybe he felt wronged and wanted to set boundaries, but abruptly ending the relationship and evicting her from a home he pays for could seem harsh. Even if he owns the apartment, the emotional impact of cutting her off so suddenly without discussion might be seen as controlling or dismissive. \n\nAlso, considering their living situation: if she was living in his apartment and he's the sole financial provider, he does have the right to ask her to leave, technically. But the emotional aspect is complicated. People in relationships expect a certain level of mutual respect and communication. If she felt she couldn't discuss her plans with him, maybe there were deeper issues. But the author's response of immediate eviction without trying to resolve the conflict might have been too harsh. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning for not telling him was that he would disapprove. If that's the case, maybe she was trying to make an independent choice, but her method of doing so without communication could be problematic. The author's reaction, while possibly justified in feeling betrayed, might have been too severe. Instead of immediate eviction, a discussion about boundaries or concerns about her safety could have been a better approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has valid reasons for feeling betrayed, especially given their emphasis on trust. On the other hand, his action of evicting her might have been an overreaction. The girlfriend's decision to go on a trip without communication is also a problem. But the author's method of handling it could come off as controlling, even if he had the right to do so. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but his approach might be seen as harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If we're answering strictly A or B, the answer would be B for No, because the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to a breach of trust, even if the method was extreme. Alternatively, if the focus is on the method being too harsh, then A. But given the context of their relationship dynamics and the emphasis on trust, B might be more accurate.\n"
