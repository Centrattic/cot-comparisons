Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, which is a big deal because she can't afford it. They're both big on trust, which is why they were upfront about their lives and future plans. The girlfriend had always loved traveling and planned a solo trip across South America. She hadn't told him until 5 days before leaving, saying he wouldn't let her go alone. The author kicks her out, and others are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip until it was almost time to go, which he obviously didn't expect. The author felt it was a betrayal of trust, given their emphasis on trust. Also, since he pays for the apartment, she didn't have the right to stay without his consent.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's argument was that she wanted independence and self-discovery. She might have felt restricted, but the timing of the announcement was an issue. The author's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. However, considering he pays for the apartment, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not contributing to the rent. \n\nBut is that the right approach? Relationships require communication and compromise. Maybe the author's reaction was too extreme. Instead of immediately ending the relationship and kicking her out, he could have discussed his concerns and tried to find a solution. The fact that he was even okay to give her money for a hotel shows he didn't want her to be homeless, but his public accusation of controlling behavior might have been a reaction to his own insecurity or fear of losing her.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend not informing him about a months-long plan shows a lack of communication on her part. But 5 days before the trip is a very short notice. Maybe she should have talked to him earlier. However, the author's response of ending the relationship and kicking her out could be seen as overreacting, especially if the core issue was about trust and independence. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions that affect the other person should be discussed. The girlfriend didn't do that, but the author's reaction might be too harsh. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs. The author might not be in the wrong if the apartment is his, but the way he reacted could be seen as controlling. The fact that others called him an asshole suggests that society might see it as a harsh response. But if trust was a cornerstone of their relationship, her not sharing the trip could have been a breach of trust, which he might have felt justified in ending the relationship. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. On one hand, she didn't communicate properly. On the other, his reaction was immediate and severe. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In many cases, communication is key, but the girlfriend's actions did impact the author's living situation. However, ending the relationship in that moment might not be the fault of the author if the trust was broken. But the method of handling it\u2014kicking her out\u2014could be seen as wrong because it's a drastic step. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more diplomatically. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite the girlfriend's misstep, his reaction was too harsh and controlling. Even if he pays for the apartment, the way he ended the relationship immediately without attempting to resolve the issue could be seen as wrong. Alternatively, if the trust was broken, maybe he's not in the wrong. But given the emphasis on mutual trust, her not sharing such a big plan could be a breach, but his response was extreme. I think the answer leans towards A because the approach was too harsh, even if there were valid concerns.\n"
