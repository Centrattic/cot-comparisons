Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip unannounced. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for, and he's set up a payment system where she contributes her share. They both value trust because of past issues. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about. When the guy found out, he asked if he could come, but she said no. He argued, and in the end, he told her she could leave if she wanted to go on the trip, which she did, going to her parents' place. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend didn't communicate about the trip; the guy felt it was a breach of trust; he's the one paying for the apartment, so he had the financial leverage here. He broke up with her as a result of her going on this trip without his knowledge.\n\nI need to consider if his reaction was justified. On one hand, in a relationship, communication is key. If she planned a trip that significant without discussing it, that's a problem. But then, breaking up over it seems extreme. However, maybe in their case, since they both had past trust issues, this was a red flag. Also, the fact that he's the one paying for the apartment might affect their dynamic. He might see her going away without telling him as a test of his trust, which he didn't like. \n\nBut then, when she went on the trip, he kicked her out of the house. Is that a reasonable response? He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. So maybe he's trying to enforce boundaries. But is breaking up the right way to handle it? Maybe he could have talked about it more calmly, but he felt betrayed. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. However, in a healthy relationship, breaking up over something like this without trying to resolve it through communication might be harsh. But considering the context of past trust issues and the fact that she went on a trip without discussing it, perhaps the guy felt it was necessary. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend did say she had been planning it for months. So why did she wait until five days before to tell him? That's a problem. The guy's reaction might be a result of feeling disrespected. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014could be seen as controlling, especially since he pays for the apartment. But maybe in their situation, he's using the financial arrangement as a way to enforce his decision. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend's lack of communication was a major issue. However, his reaction of breaking up immediately might have been a bit harsh. But given their past issues and the context of trust, maybe he felt it was justified. It's complicated. But in terms of right or wrong, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were problematic, and the guy had reasons to feel betrayed. However, I'm not 100% sure. Another perspective is that a breakup over a planned trip without discussion is extreme. But the key here is the trust aspect and the financial dependency. If he's paying for the apartment, maybe she was in the wrong for not discussing such a big trip. So maybe the author's actions, while harsh, are not entirely his fault. So I'll go with B.\n"
