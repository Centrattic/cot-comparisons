Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after ending the relationship because his girlfriend went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context is important. They were in a 3-year relationship living in an apartment he paid for. She wanted to take a solo trip, which he found out about just days before she left. He asked to come along, but she said no, and she didn't tell him earlier because she thought he wouldn't let her go. He responded by telling her she could leave if that's what she wanted.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and communication. They've always been open with each other, so maybe she should have discussed the trip earlier. But she did say she had been planning it for months, which might mean she had her reasons for keeping it a secret. However, not informing him about such a significant life event could be seen as a breach of trust, even if they valued trust highly.\n\nHe paid for the apartment, so he might feel like he's the one investing in the relationship's stability. Her going on a solo trip at short notice might have made him feel insecure or disrespected. His response was to kick her out, which could be seen as extreme. But maybe he felt it was a way to respect her autonomy if she didn't want to live under his roof anymore. \n\nBut wait, is ending the relationship over this the right move? Some might argue that a breakup is a harsh reaction. Others might say that if she didn't value communication, then he's justified in leaving. Also, the fact that she went to her parents and others criticized him as controlling complicates things. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If she didn't talk to him about the trip, even if it was planned for months, that's a problem. But his reaction of immediately ending things might not be the healthiest approach. However, given their history of cheating and trust issues, maybe he felt this was a breaking point. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he did make a big decision quickly. However, considering the context of trust and the terms of their living arrangement, he might feel justified. It's a tough call. But many would say that a breakup over this is too severe. Hence, he might be in the wrong.\n"
