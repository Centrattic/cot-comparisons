Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the context: they're in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, which is a two-bedroom. She's planning a solo trip across South America, unannounced, and he kicks her out. He says she didn't pay for the apartment, so she had no right to stay. She goes to her parents, and he gets criticized.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is the unannounced trip. The girlfriend had been planning it for months but didn't tell him. When he asked to come along, she said no because she wanted to \"discover herself,\" implying she needed independence. He then tells her she can leave, which led to her moving out. \n\nNow, considering their relationship dynamics. They've always been big on trust because both had been cheated on before. They share a lot about their lives and future plans. He pays for the apartment solo, allowing her to spend on gifts and trips. But she planned a major trip without informing him, which he clearly didn't like. \n\nHe argues that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to stay. But they're in a relationship, so sharing an apartment is part of the mutual agreement. If he's the one paying, maybe he expected her to be in the same city. But she planned a trip that would require her to leave, which he didn't agree with. \n\nHe kicked her out after an argument. The problem here is the communication. She didn't tell him about the trip until last minute, even though she had planned it for months. He felt betrayed or disrespected. However, his response was to kick her out, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should have discussed major life decisions. Her not informing him about the trip is a breach of trust. But his reaction of making her leave the apartment is also significant. If they were in a healthy relationship, maybe working through the issue would be better than splitting. However, given their history of trust issues, maybe this was a deal-breaker. \n\nHe might be in the right if he felt this was a deal-breaker because of trust. But kicking someone out of a shared home without prior agreement or legal grounds could be problematic. If the apartment is in his name, he might have legal standing to ask her to leave, but emotionally, it's a different story. \n\nHowever, in a relationship where both are supposed to live together, making a major decision to leave suddenly without discussion could be seen as self-serving. He's using the fact that she doesn't pay rent as a reason, but if they were in a committed relationship, that might not hold up emotionally. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might have a right to her independence, but not informing him about such a significant trip is a red flag. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt this was a lack of respect. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out during an argument\u2014could be seen as impulsive. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the key issue is communication and mutual respect. The author's action might be seen as a valid response if he felt it was a betrayal of trust. However, using the apartment as leverage without discussing it beforehand might be inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the right because the girlfriend's actions were secretive and might have broken his trust, but his method of ending it could be seen as harsh. However, given the context of their trust issues and the fact that he's the one paying for the apartment, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
