Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip he didn't know about. The context is they've been in a 3-year relationship, live in an apartment he pays for, and both value trust.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a solo trip for months and didn't tell him until 5 days before. He wanted to come, but she said no, saying he wouldn't support her. The conflict escalated to the point where he told her to leave if she wanted to go, and she did, moving in with her parents. Now he's being called an asshole, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details: The apartment is paid for by him, and she's not contributing financially. When he found out about the trip, he felt it was a breach of trust. But she had planned it for months without telling him. The key issue here is communication. In a relationship, especially one that values trust, not discussing major life decisions like a solo trip abroad is a problem. However, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to have her leave\u2014might have been harsh. \n\nHe could have expressed his feelings and concerns first. By immediately kicking her out, he might have overreacted. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. Even if she wasn't paying for the apartment, they were in a partnership. His response, while justified in feeling betrayed, could be seen as controlling because he's the one paying for the house. However, since he's the one paying, maybe he had the right to set boundaries. \n\nBut the bigger issue is the lack of communication from her. She had a right to her own experiences, but not at the expense of their relationship. Still, the way he handled it could have been more constructive. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe discussing the implications of her trip and finding a compromise. \n\nGiven that, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to a breach of trust, but his method of resolving it was abrupt. So, while her actions were problematic, his response could be considered harsh. However, since he's the one who paid for the apartment, perhaps he wasn't in the wrong. It's a tough call. I think the author is not in the wrong because the breach of trust was on her side, but his handling of it was poor. Still, he's not entirely wrong.\n"
