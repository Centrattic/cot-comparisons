Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had been planning this trip for months and finally told him a few days before it was supposed to start. The author didn't know about it and was upset. He offered to let her go if she left his home, which he pays for entirely. She went to her parents' house instead and he got criticized for being controlling.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major life decision that would affect their living situation. They were in a committed relationship for three years and had trust issues from past relationships. The fact that she waited until last minute and didn't discuss it seems like a breach of trust. \n\nBut then, the author's response was to kick her out. He mentions that she didn't pay for the apartment, so maybe he felt justified in asking her to leave. However, breaking up just because she went on a trip he didn't like might come off as controlling, especially since she had the right to travel. \n\nWait, she's the one who decided to go on a solo trip. The author's reaction was to end the relationship because of that. But maybe he didn't need to kick her out. They could have talked it through. Also, by not discussing it earlier, she might have been avoiding conflict. But the author's response was pretty harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans. On the other, the author's response was extreme. Maybe the author is in the wrong because ending the relationship in that way could be seen as overreacting. Or maybe he's justified because she didn't respect his feelings and broke trust. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The fact that she planned it for months and didn't tell him is a problem, but his reaction might be too harsh. Maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he could have handled the situation differently without breaking up. But some might say B because she didn't communicate. Hmm.\n"
