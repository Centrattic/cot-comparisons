Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the couple has been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment entirely, and they split the utility bills through a meter. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America, which he found out about only a few days before she was supposed to leave. He didn't agree with her going alone, and they argued, leading him to ask her to leave the apartment. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend had been planning the trip for months but didn't tell him until last minute. The author says she mentioned that he wouldn't have allowed her to go, so she kept it a secret. The author then kicked her out, even though he pays for the apartment and she doesn't live there for free. The girlfriend went to her parents' house, and the author got a lot of backlash from others calling him controlling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. In a relationship, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't discuss the trip with him, which is a big decision, especially since they mentioned being big on trust. However, keeping a three-month planned trip a secret until three days before departure is a problem. The author did pay for the apartment, so he's not obligated to let her stay if she doesn't contribute financially. By asking her to leave, he's enforcing the terms they had set up (since she didn't pay for the apartment, she could leave if he asked). \n\nBut was it the right approach? Arguing and then giving an ultimatum by asking her to leave might not be the best way to handle things. It's possible that he could have discussed the issue more calmly, maybe expressed his concerns about her safety and their relationship, but instead he escalated it to kicking her out. The fact that he offered money for a hotel shows he wasn't entirely cold, but the immediate response of asking her to leave might be seen as harsh, even if he has the financial right to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, if they had always been transparent with each other, her not telling him about a significant life decision like a solo trip is a breach of trust. The author might feel that her lack of communication was a deal-breaker, especially given their history of past cheating in previous relationships. So, in that context, maybe he was trying to enforce the trust aspect by cutting things off when she didn't communicate.\n\nBut kicking someone out of the shared home, even if you pay for it, is a major step. It can be seen as extreme, even if he has the legal right. Relationships require negotiation and respect. The author's response might have been too abrupt and not leaving room for discussion. The girlfriend might have felt that the trip was important to her personal growth, and he didn't support her, which could be a valid point from her side. However, the lack of communication from her is definitely a problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's action was a consequence of the girlfriend's lack of transparency, but the way he handled it (immediate ultimatum) might not have been the best approach. However, considering the context of their agreement about the apartment and the fact that she didn't contribute financially, he might have the right to ask her to leave. Still, the emotional impact and the method of communication might be where he's in the wrong. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's enforcing the terms of their living situation, but the way he did it could be harsh. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong (A) because he reacted too strongly. I'm a bit torn here. The key factors are the lack of communication from the girlfriend and the author's right to the apartment. If she was supposed to be transparent, her secrecy is the bigger issue, but his reaction is still a hard one. I think the community might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's standing by his terms, but some might say A because it's a harsh response. But given the context, maybe B is the answer.\n"
