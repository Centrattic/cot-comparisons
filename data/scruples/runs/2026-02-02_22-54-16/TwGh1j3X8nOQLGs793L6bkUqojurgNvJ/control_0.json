Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, they lived together in an apartment he paid for. The girlfriend planned a solo trip that she said she had been planning for months. The author didn't know about it and felt betrayed because he thought she should have discussed it with him. They had a big argument, and he told her she could leave. She went to her parents' house, and people are calling him an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. They mentioned they were big on trust since both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend thought he wouldn't want her to go alone, so she kept it a secret. The author felt that since she wasn't contributing financially to the apartment, he had the right to ask her to leave.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend might feel disrespected that she didn't communicate her plans. On the other hand, she did plan it for months and felt she had the right to her independence. The author's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. Using the financial arrangement as a justification for eviction might not be fair, especially if they were a couple. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. While the girlfriend's secrecy was wrong, the author's reaction of evicting her might be too extreme. Also, the emotional impact on both sides needs to be considered. The author might have overreacted by making it about money instead of discussing the issue calmly. So, I think the author is in the wrong because his response was harsh and possibly not the best way to handle the situation, even if the girlfriend made a mistake.\n"
