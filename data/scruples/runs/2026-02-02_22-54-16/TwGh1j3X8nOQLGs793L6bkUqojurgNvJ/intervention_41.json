Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment alone, she helps with the bill by compensating him for her share. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She's into traveling, and they've had trips together. Now, she had a solo trip planned for months but told him 5 days before leaving. He asked if he could come, she said no, explaining it's for self-discovery. He felt she didn't respect his boundaries by not informing him, leading to an argument and him telling her to leave his house.\n\nHe claims he was willing to let her go if she paid for a hotel, which she refused. So she moved out, and he's now being called a controlling asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, in a healthy relationship, communication is key. She had been planning this for months, so maybe she should have told him earlier. If she knew he wouldn't want her to go alone, that's a red flag. But he's the one who pays for the apartment. They had an agreement where she compensates him. So the living arrangement is part of their mutual agreement. If she left the apartment because of the breakup, maybe he's not wrong to enforce the terms he set. \n\nBut the way he handled it might be an issue. Telling her to \"pack your bags and get out\" could come off as harsh, especially if the breakup was immediate. Even if they had an agreement, doing it that quickly without a transition period might be seen as controlling or not giving her a chance to adjust. Also, the fact that he didn't let her stay in the apartment he owns, even temporarily, when she was still part of the relationship at that point could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if he felt that her decision to go on the trip without discussing it was a betrayal of trust, especially since they were big on honesty, then maybe he felt justified. But the key point is that she had the right to her own decisions as long as they didn't violate their agreements. If the apartment arrangement was flexible and she had access to it, her surprise might have been a problem, but his immediate response might have been too extreme.\n\nWait, but he mentions that she didn't pay for the apartment and therefore didn't have the right to demand to stay. He offered to pay for a hotel, which she refused. So if the apartment is his and they had an agreement, maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave. But the breakup happened right after the argument. Is it right to end the relationship over a disagreement about a trip? Maybe not. The severity of the reaction could be where he went wrong. Ending the relationship because of a solo trip that he didn't like, even if it's a breach of communication, might be disproportionate. \n\nAlso, considering they had trust issues, her not communicating something major like a solo trip could indeed be a breach of trust. He might have felt it was a deal-breaker. But the way he handled the breakup and the immediate eviction could be seen as harsh, especially if she had been planning it for months. Maybe he should have given her a chance to leave on her own terms, or handled the breakup more privately instead of using the apartment as leverage. \n\nSo there's a balance here. If the trip was a significant enough issue to break up over, then his reaction is understandable. But if he used the apartment situation to force her out during the breakup, that could be seen as controlling. The fact that he's the one paying for the apartment complicates things because it's his property. However, being in a relationship usually means some level of shared living space. If he decided to end the relationship, he's not wrong to ask her to leave, but the timing and the method might be questionable. \n\nThe main issue is the communication. If she had told him earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But he's reacting by ending the relationship immediately when she brings it up last minute. That could be seen as an overreaction. However, if he felt that her decision was a violation of their trust and communication standards, then maybe it's justified. \n\nThe community often has mixed opinions on these. Sometimes, the immediate eviction is seen as wrong because it's using financial leverage. Other times, if the relationship is ending over a major issue, it's acceptable. \n\nIn this case, the trip wasn't a surprise in the sense of her just deciding last minute, but she kept it from him for months. He might have felt that lack of transparency was a major issue. So, while the trip itself might not be inherently wrong, the way she withheld information could be a problem. His response, though, might be seen as taking away her home (even if it's his apartment) during a breakup, which can be harsh. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the lack of communication was a deal-breaker. If the breakup was because of her not being honest, then he's not in the wrong. But if the breakup was just because he didn't want her to go on the trip alone, then he might be the one in the wrong. The story says he believed it was right because she didn't pay for the apartment and he was willing to give her money for a hotel. She refused. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he stood by his agreement. But the timing of the breakup and the way he enforced it might make others see it as controlling. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards AITA not being on his side because the breakup was immediate and using the apartment as a tool, especially if she had been in the house and it's his property. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B is the answer here because he's enforcing his own boundaries and the agreement.\n"
