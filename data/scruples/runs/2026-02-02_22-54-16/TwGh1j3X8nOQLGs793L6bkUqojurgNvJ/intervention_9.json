Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling her boyfriend, who had been paying for their apartment. The boyfriend then kicked her out, leading to people calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a 3-year relationship, both value trust because of past issues with cheating. The apartment is his, and she contributes by covering her part of the expenses. He was okay with her spending on trips and gifts, but this solo trip came as a surprise. She said she planned it for months but didn't tell him, thinking he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to her leaving, and he told her to leave the house since she didn't pay for it. She went to her parents', and people are upset with him.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend might feel that trust is a two-way street. If she planned something significant without discussing it, that's a breach of trust. However, his reaction of kicking her out seems extreme. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, it's their home, and using the threat of eviction because of a disagreement might not be appropriate. \n\nAlso, their financial arrangement is that he pays for the apartment, and she compensates him. But the apartment is their shared home. Even if she's not the one paying the rent, she's living there. Telling her to leave without notice might be seen as controlling. The boyfriend's argument that she could leave on her own terms but without his home's security is a bit contradictory because if they're in a committed relationship, she might expect to stay in the home regardless of financial contributions. \n\nThe fact that he offered to help her with a hotel might not mitigate the abruptness of the situation. People might see his reaction as a power move rather than a necessary step. The girlfriend had the right to plan her trip, but maybe not to do so without communication. However, the boyfriend's response was to end the relationship by kicking her out, which could be seen as an overreaction, especially if he was willing to support her financially for a week. \n\nIn terms of trust and communication, both sides might have failed. But the boyfriend's action of using the apartment as leverage to end the relationship seems harsh. The girlfriend's secret planning was a problem, but the way he ended it could be seen as controlling. So maybe the author is in the wrong for how he handled it, even if the initial issue was her lack of communication.\n"
