Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They've been together for 3 years, live in an apartment he pays for entirely. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, didn't tell him until 5 days before it started, and said he wouldn't have allowed her to go. The author got angry, told her she can leave if she wants, and she did, moving to her parents. Now people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's asking if he's really in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major decision that affects their shared living situation. Even though he pays for the apartment, they presumably live together, so her absence for an extended period would impact their routine, maybe responsibilities around the house, or even his financial arrangements if he was covering her part. The fact that she had been planning it for months but didn't tell him suggests a breakdown in communication. They said they were big on trust, so not sharing such a significant plan could be seen as a betrayal of that trust.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her to leave the house. He did offer a hotel for a week, which she refused. But kicking someone out of a shared home can be a serious action, even if he's the one paying. If they're in a committed relationship and cohabiting, the home is a shared space regardless of who pays. So, making her leave immediately might be harsh, especially if the issue could have been discussed and resolved without ending the relationship. \n\nNow, considering both sides: The girlfriend had a right to her autonomy and wanted to travel, which is a personal choice. But she didn't communicate this, which is important in a relationship, especially one built on trust. The author's reaction, while perhaps justified in feeling betrayed, might have been too extreme. Ending the relationship over a disagreement, even one rooted in trust issues, could be seen as a disproportionate response. \n\nHowever, maybe the author felt that after not being informed, their trust was compromised. If they had prior agreements about major decisions, her not adhering to that could be a problem. But without knowing if there were previous discussions or rules about such trips, it's hard to say. The author's background of being in a controlling situation isn't clear here, but since he was the one paying the rent and allowing her to stay, his decision to end the living arrangement might be his way of asserting boundaries.\n\nBut in most cases, breaking up because of a communication issue without attempting to resolve it through discussion, maybe setting boundaries or understanding each other's needs, is a red flag. The immediate kickout without a cooling-off period or a more measured approach could be seen as him overreacting. Also, the fact that she's moving to her parents might not even be due to his action but a result of her own decision, though the argument led to it.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the problem was the lack of communication, then maybe the author has a valid point. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out instead of talking through the issue\u2014might be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. Even if she was wrong to not tell him, his response could be seen as extreme. People might argue that trust should be discussed rather than met with immediate eviction. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had a history of relying on his financial support and he felt that her actions disrespected the trust they built, perhaps his reaction is a form of holding her accountable. But again, the method of accountability is key. Ending the relationship and forcing her out of the home without a conversation could be viewed as controlling, especially if there's no prior agreement that such trips require mutual discussion.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because while communication from the girlfriend was poor, the immediate and drastic action of kicking her out contributes to the conflict. A healthier approach would be to discuss the issue, express his feelings, and see how to move forward. Instead, he escalated the situation, leading to the breakup, which might not have been necessary. His actions could come off as controlling, hence the backlash he received from others.\n"
