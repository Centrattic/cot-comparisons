Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend took an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The context given is that they've been in a 3-year relationship, living in an apartment he pays for entirely. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had been planning the trip for months but didn't inform him until a few days before. The author tried to join but she refused, citing it's about self-discovery and he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone. He argues that since he's the one paying for the apartment and she didn't contribute financially to the trip, she shouldn't have the right to stay. She ended up moving out, and he's being called controlling. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The girlfriend's right to travel is a personal freedom, but her not informing him about a months-long plan seems like a breach of trust. The couple emphasized trust, so her secrecy might be a significant issue. The author's response was to kick her out, which could be seen as extreme, but maybe he felt it was necessary to set boundaries after repeated dishonesty. \n\nHowever, the way he phrased it, \"you can, without me or the security of my home,\" might come off as harsh. Ending a relationship is a big step, and the author's decision to frame it as an ultimatum could be problematic. But given their history of cheating and the importance of trust, his reaction is understandable. \n\nThe key points are the breach of trust through secrecy about a major life decision and the author's right to set boundaries in a relationship he's funding. The girlfriend's refusal to share such a significant plan might have justified his decision, even if the method was abrupt. On the other hand, maybe he should have handled it with more communication. But since the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, I need to see if the evidence supports that. \n\nConsidering the emphasis on trust and her not sharing months of planning, the author's actions could be seen as protecting the relationship's integrity. The fact that she didn't help with the apartment costs might also play a role in his decision. So, the answer might be B (No), because he's addressing a trust issue they both valued, and she was being dishonest about her plans.\n"
