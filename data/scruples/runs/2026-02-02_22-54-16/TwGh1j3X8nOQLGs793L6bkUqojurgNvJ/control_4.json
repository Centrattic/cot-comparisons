Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. They were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment himself, which is a bit out of her price range. They have a trust-based relationship, both having been cheated on before. The woman planned a solo trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about, and she admitted she didn't tell him because he might not have let her go. He then told her she could leave, and she did, staying with her parents. He's now being called a controlling asshole by others.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication, trust, and boundaries. The woman planned a trip without telling him, which he saw as a breach of trust. He responded by asking her to leave the apartment, which he solely pays for. The key issues are whether his reaction was justified and if her actions crossed a boundary.\n\nOn the communication side, she did tell him she planned this for months and knew he wouldn't approve. He tried to come along, but she refused. The argument led to him giving her an ultimatum. The problem here is that while she had the right to want to travel solo, she didn't communicate this earlier, which might have caused unnecessary conflict. However, his response of kicking her out might be seen as extreme, especially since the apartment is his and she doesn't pay for it. But their relationship was supposed to be based on trust, so his reaction might be seen as a loss of trust or a lack of communication.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since he owns the apartment and she doesn't pay rent, he's within his rights to ask her to leave. But emotionally, the situation is more complex. Ending a relationship over a disagreement about a trip might seem harsh, especially if there's a history of trust issues. However, if the trip was a deal-breaker for him and she was insistent, then maybe his reaction is understandable. \n\nThe people calling him a controlling asshole might be right if he's being overly possessive. But if the trust in their relationship was based on mutual respect and communication, her not informing him about a significant life decision could be a breach of that trust. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer depends on whether the author's actions were a justified response to a breach of trust or an overreaction. Since the woman had planned this trip for months and didn't communicate it until it was imminent, it shows a lack of transparency. The author's decision to end the relationship in response might be his way of setting a boundary. However, the method of kicking her out might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of perspective. The answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because he had boundaries and the apartment was his to manage, but there's a nuance here. However, given the structure of the question and the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
