Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, they lived in a two-bedroom apartment that the author paid for entirely. The girlfriend wasn't contributing financially because of a meter system. They both valued trust due to past cheating issues. She had been wanting to travel, and he allowed her to go on trips before, even paying part of the cost. This time, she bought a solo trip across South America, which he didn't know about until it was almost time to go. He offered to come with her, but she refused, saying it was for self-discovery. The argument led to him telling her to leave his apartment since she didn't pay for it. She went to her parents' house, and now he's wondering if he was the asshole.\n\nSo, to analyze: The key points are communication, trust, and the living arrangement. The author paid for the apartment, so the girlfriend wasn't financially responsible for it. However, they lived together. If she had planned this trip for months, why didn't she communicate it earlier? That's a problem. The author trusted her, and she didn't share her plans, which could be a breach of trust. But he also made a choice to kick her out, which is a drastic action. Even though he paid for the apartment, ending the relationship because she went on a trip without his knowledge might be seen as controlling, especially since they were in a trusting relationship. However, given their history of cheating, maybe open communication was a big deal. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt that lack of communication was a deal-breaker. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out and not allowing her to stay\u2014could be seen as harsh, even if he had the financial right to do so. The balance here is between respecting her autonomy and the need for trust. If she broke trust by not discussing the trip, then his reaction might make sense. But if the trip wasn't a secret and she just chose not to involve him, maybe he overreacted. It's tricky. I think the main issue is communication. If she planned it for months without telling him, that's a problem. But his response was to end the relationship immediately, which could be seen as extreme. However, considering their past issues with trust, maybe he felt it was necessary. So, the answer could be either way. But I think the author is not entirely in the wrong. He had valid reasons about trust and communication. However, the way he handled it might have been abrupt. But given the context, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
