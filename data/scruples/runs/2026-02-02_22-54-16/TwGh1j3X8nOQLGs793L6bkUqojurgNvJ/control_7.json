Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe couple has been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment, and they have a system where she compensates him for her portion of the utilities. They've always been big on trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, announced it last minute, and the author didn't want her to go alone. When she said she wouldn't have told him because he wouldn't allow it, he told her she could leave without him, and she did. He kicked her out of the house, and now people are calling him an asshole. \n\nHmm. So first, the key points here are the sudden announcement of a trip she had planned for months, the author's reaction, and whether that was justified. \n\nThe girlfriend says she had been planning it for months but didn't tell him because he wouldn't support her going alone. The author didn't know about it until 5 days before she was leaving. That seems like a big thing to not discuss. In a relationship, especially one built on trust, you'd expect major life decisions like a solo trip across continents to be shared. But maybe she felt she had to keep it a secret because she knew he'd be against it. \n\nThe author's response was to kick her out, saying she could leave without him and that she didn't have a right to stay because she doesn't pay for the apartment. He offered money for a hotel, but she went to her parents. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up over this seems extreme. The trip was planned for months, but she didn't tell him. That's a breach of trust, right? They emphasized trust in their relationship. If she didn't tell him something so significant, that could be a problem. But on the other hand, he reacted in a way that immediately ended the relationship. Maybe he should have talked through it first instead of evicting her. \n\nHe mentions that he pays for the apartment, so she wasn't in a position to demand to stay. But kicking her out right then could be seen as cutting off the relationship because she made a decision he didn't agree with. Even if he's not in the wrong for not wanting her to go alone, the way he handled it might be harsh. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might have felt her autonomy was being challenged. She wanted to travel alone, which is a personal choice. If the author didn't support it, maybe that's a communication issue rather than an immediate breakup. \n\nBut the fact that she didn't tell him about a major trip could be a bigger issue. If their relationship is built on open communication, her not sharing something so important might be the real problem. However, the author's response of breaking up and evicting her might be disproportionate. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The girlfriend for not communicating, or the author for reacting too harshly? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author might feel that the trust was broken by her not telling him, but his reaction was immediate and severe. Maybe he should have expressed his concerns without ending the relationship. \n\nAlternatively, if the author felt that this was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. But breaking up via kicking her out of the house and not discussing might not be the best approach. \n\nI think the answer here hinges on whether the author's reaction was appropriate. Since the trip was a significant decision that she didn't share, but the immediate breakup seems harsh, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. However, if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe not. \n\nBut given that they had an argument and he made the decision to end the relationship during that argument, which could be emotional, he might be acting impulsively. So perhaps the answer is A, that he is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with more consideration.\n"
