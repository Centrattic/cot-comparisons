Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong after dumping his girlfriend because she went on an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple lived together in an apartment that the author pays for entirely. The girlfriend was planning a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months. When she told him, he wanted to come along but she refused, saying she wanted to \"discover herself.\" She hadn't told him earlier because she thought he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to the author telling her to leave his home since she didn't pay for it. She went to her parents' house, and people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nSo the key points are: the apartment is paid by the author, the girlfriend's unannounced trip, the argument, and the subsequent breakup. The author believes he's justified because she didn't pay for the apartment and thus had no right to stay. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Trust is a big part here, since both have been cheated on before. But the girlfriend made a significant decision without discussing it with her partner, which might be a breach of trust. However, in relationships, both partners need to communicate major plans. Her not informing him about the trip for months is a problem. On the other hand, the author's reaction of making her leave their shared home immediately might be too harsh. Kicking someone out over a disagreement, even if they don't pay the rent, can be seen as extreme. Also, the apartment was supposed to be a shared space based on mutual trust. Maybe the author should have discussed his concerns earlier if he had issues with her travel plans.\n\nBut the apartment is his, and technically, she might not have the legal right to stay there if it's under his name. However, in many places, if someone is a live-in partner, even if they don't pay rent, they have some rights. But the author might have a point if they were in a mutual agreement where she was supposed to contribute in other ways. However, using the argument to kick her out seems like a severe punishment for not discussing a trip, even if it's a big deal.\n\nAlso, the author's own actions\u2014saying \"you can leave if you go on this trip\"\u2014could be seen as controlling, using the living arrangement as leverage. That might explain why people are calling him a controlling asshole. The way he handled it was confrontational and led to an immediate breakup, which might not be the best approach. Instead of giving her an ultimatum without prior discussion, he could have expressed his concerns more calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did plan a major trip without consulting him, which is a significant issue in a relationship. She had been planning it for months, so maybe she should have included him in the decision-making process. But given their history of trust issues, communication should be key. If she felt the need to keep it a secret, that might indicate underlying problems in the relationship.\n\nIn summary, the author might have valid concerns about the lack of communication, but his reaction of immediately evicting her seems excessive. The situation is a bit of a gray area. However, using the living arrangement as punishment could be seen as wrong. So, probably the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the way he handled it, especially the ultimatum, was harsh and not a fair resolution. However, the girlfriend's secrecy also contributed to the problem.\n"
