Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, context is key here. The couple lived in an apartment that the author pays for solely. They've been together for three years and emphasize trust, given both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which he wasn't aware of until she announced it. He asked to join, but she refused, saying it was about self-discovery. He argued she didn't need his permission since she wasn't paying for the apartment, and he offered hotel money, which she refused. Then he told her to leave, she went to her parents, and people are calling him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the author is in a position of financial responsibility for their shared home. The girlfriend's unannounced trip might disrupt their living arrangement. But the key here is the communication. She had planned this for months but didn't inform him. That's a breach of trust, which they valued highly. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme, but maybe he felt betrayed. However, breaking up immediately after an argument might be hasty. The question is whether this response is justified. \n\nOn one hand, he might feel disrespected and that her secret planning undermines their trust. On the other, ending the relationship right then without giving her a chance to talk through it could be seen as impulsive. The fact that he offered financial support for her trip shows he's trying to be considerate, but kicking her out of the home they share\u2014his home\u2014might be a power move. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as self-centered, but the author's response is equally abrupt. The problem is whether the author overreacted. Since the trip was a surprise and the trust was a cornerstone, maybe the author felt the relationship couldn't continue. But the immediate breakup without a discussion might be hasty. However, if he felt this was a deal-breaker, then maybe it's his right to end things. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions were proportionate. The girlfriend didn't ask for permission, but the author's reaction of kicking her out and ending the relationship is significant. It's possible both have valid points. But given the emphasis on trust and the fact that she kept the trip secret for months, the author might feel justified. However, the suddenness of the breakup without trying to resolve the issue first could be seen as his fault. \n\nI think the author is partly in the wrong because ending a long-term relationship can be a big step without proper discussion. But the situation is complex. The correct answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his reaction was immediate and extreme, not allowing for dialogue. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the breach of trust was too much. Given the emphasis on trust and her secrecy, maybe B is correct. But I'm a bit torn.\n"
