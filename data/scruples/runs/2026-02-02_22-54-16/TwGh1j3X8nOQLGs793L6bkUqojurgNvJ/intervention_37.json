Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America and told her boyfriend just five days before she was leaving. The author paid for the apartment and they had a trust-based relationship. The girlfriend didn't want the author to come and said he wouldn't have allowed her to go alone. The argument led to the author telling her to leave the apartment, which she did, and now people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The apartment is paid for by the author, and the girlfriend is a guest there. They've been together for three years and had a lot of trust. The key points are the unannounced trip, the fact that she had been planning it for months but didn't tell him until last minute, and the decision to kick her out.\n\nThe author's perspective is that since he pays for the apartment, she doesn't have any right to demand staying, and he offered to pay for a hotel. But she left to her parents' place. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is important. The girlfriend might have felt she needed her independence, which is something that's valid. However, not informing the partner about such a significant life decision could be seen as a breach of trust. They mentioned being big on trust, so maybe the girlfriend's actions undermined that. On the other hand, the author's response of kicking her out seems extreme. Even if the apartment is his, ending the relationship by making her leave might be seen as harsh. Especially since she didn't pay for the apartment, but they were in a committed relationship. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't have the right to stay since she didn't pay for the apartment. However, in a relationship, it's common for couples to share a home regardless of financial contributions. The fact that the author chose not to charge her directly but let her contribute via a meter might mean he didn't expect her to pay, but that doesn't negate the expectation of her being there. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be her personal freedom, but she should have discussed it more with her partner, especially given their history of trust issues. The author might feel that her secrecy and last-minute announcement was a betrayal. However, reacting by kicking her out immediately could be seen as overreacting. The author could have tried to discuss it more, express his feelings, and maybe find a compromise instead of ending the relationship abruptly.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The girlfriend might have felt the need to do this trip for self-discovery, which is important, but the way she handled it might have been disrespectful. The author's reaction, while perhaps a result of hurt feelings, might not have been the best way to handle the conflict. Ending the relationship because of a disagreement over a trip seems extreme unless there were other underlying issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The girlfriend's secrecy could be a problem, but the author's response might also be too harsh. The decision to end the relationship by making her leave the house immediately might not be justified unless there was a prior agreement about such situations. The author might feel wronged, but reacting in a way that cuts off the relationship entirely could be seen as the author being in the wrong as well. However, if the girlfriend's actions broke a fundamental trust, then maybe the author's decision was a way to set a boundary.\n\nSo, considering all factors, it's a tough call. If the girlfriend had been planning this for months and didn't communicate it, that's on her. But the author's solution of kicking her out without trying to resolve the conflict might be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if he felt wronged. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because ending the relationship in such a manner could be seen as too extreme, despite the girlfriend's actions.\n"
