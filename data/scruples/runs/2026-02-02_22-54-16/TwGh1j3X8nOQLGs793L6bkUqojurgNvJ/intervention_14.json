Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to analyze the key points.\n\nFirst, context: They've been together three years, living in an apartment he pays for. She's planning a solo trip, which he discovers only 5 days before she leaves. He wanted to come, but she said it was for her to \"discover herself.\" She claims she didn't tell him because he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone. They argue, and he tells her she can leave if she wants. She moves out, and he's being called controlling.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. Let's break down factors. Communication is a big one. She planned this for months but didn't tell him earlier. Even if she thought he'd object, she could have discussed it earlier. Sudden decisions in relationships can cause tension, especially when one person is making a significant life move without consultation.\n\nThen there's the living arrangement. He's paying for the apartment, and she's not contributing financially. If she leaves, he's not obligated to let her stay, especially if they're breaking up. But the way he handled it might be an issue. Telling her to leave immediately and using the fact that she doesn't pay rent as a reason could come off as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like giving her time to find another place or helping with arrangements, rather than an immediate dump.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect. People in relationships expect a certain level of communication and mutual respect. She might feel her autonomy was important, but he might see her sudden trip as a betrayal of trust or a lack of transparency. However, breaking up in the heat of the moment might not resolve the issue. The key is whether his reaction was proportionate. Kicking her out immediately without considering the consequences (like her needing a place to stay) could be seen as harsh, even if she didn't pay rent.\n\nAnother angle: She had a history of cheating in past relationships, so trust was a big factor. If she kept this trip secret, maybe he felt it was a breach of trust. But if she had her reasons and communicated her intentions eventually, maybe he overreacted.\n\nIn conclusion, while she did plan the trip without telling him, his immediate response of breaking up and kicking her out might be too extreme. He could have handled the situation better by discussing boundaries and maybe finding a compromise. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh reaction, even if the situation was stressful.\n"
