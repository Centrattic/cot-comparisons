Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, context is important. They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, and she helps with the utilities. They've always trusted each other because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend had planned a solo trip for months and told him last minute. He didn't find out until 5 days before she left, and when he asked to come along, she said no because she wanted to \"discover herself.\" He felt she hadn't considered his feelings and ultimately kicked her out of their home, leading to the breakup.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication issues and the dynamics of their living situation. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major life decision, which he felt was a breach of trust. He's the one paying for the apartment, so when she left, he made her leave, which caused a lot of backlash from others.\n\nBut wait, was he in the wrong? Let's break it down. The trip was planned for months, but she waited until 5 days before departure to tell him. That's a short notice and could be seen as a lack of communication. However, she mentioned she didn't tell him because she thought he'd object. That implies she didn't trust his reaction, which could be a problem in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author reacted strongly by evicting her from the home. Since he pays for the apartment, he might have the legal right to ask her to leave, but relationships aren't just about legalities. Emotionally, this action could be seen as extreme. Ending a long-term relationship over a sudden decision, even if it's a deal-breaker for him, might be viewed as harsh. Also, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole suggests that society might not support his actions entirely.\n\nBut considering their history of trust, maybe the lack of communication was a bigger issue. The girlfriend's decision to go alone without discussing it thoroughly might have been a violation of their trust-based agreement. The author might have felt his boundaries were crossed, leading him to make a drastic choice.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author might have overreacted in the way he handled it, especially evicting her immediately, which could be seen as punitive. However, his frustration over unaddressed issues and lack of communication could be valid. But in terms of responsibility, initiating a breakup is a personal choice. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship expectations and how they communicated their needs. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and given that relationships require mutual respect and communication, the author's reaction might not be entirely justified. He could have handled it differently, but breaking up might not be the fault itself. However, the way he evicted her might be seen as wrong.\n"
