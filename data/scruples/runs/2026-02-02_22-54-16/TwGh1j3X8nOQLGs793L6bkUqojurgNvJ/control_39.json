Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment by himself, and they have a system where she compensates him for her share. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, planned for months, but told him only a few days before. He asked to come along, but she said it was about self-discovery. He felt she didn't communicate properly and ended up kicking her out of the house, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, even though they've always been open and trusting. He felt it was a breach of trust since they were supposed to be transparent. The guy's response was extreme\u2014kicking her out of the house. Even though he pays for the apartment, she was living there, so evicting her like that might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut he did offer her money for a hotel, so maybe he tried to be reasonable. However, breaking up over this and immediately evicting her could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication, and maybe the girlfriend should have discussed the trip earlier. But the guy's reaction was immediate and cutting off the relationship, which might be the issue here. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't handle it well. Breaking up and evicting someone over a disagreement, especially when they live together, is a big step. Even if she was wrong for not telling him, his reaction was abrupt and possibly controlling. The fact that he was willing to give her money for a hotel is a point in his favor, but the act of kicking her out and ending the relationship so quickly could make people think he's the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which is a problem in a relationship where trust is supposed to be foundational. But breaking up immediately seems extreme. The answer might be a mix, but based on the options given (A or B), the community might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of his harsh response.\n"
