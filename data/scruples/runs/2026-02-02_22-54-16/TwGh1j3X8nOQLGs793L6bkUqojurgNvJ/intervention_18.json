Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The context is important here.\n\nFirst, they lived in an apartment he paid for, and she didn't pay rent. They had an agreement where she used a meter to track her usage and compensated him. They both had trust issues from past relationships. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he found out about with only a few days notice. He tried to join, but she said it was for her personal growth. He felt she didn't respect their living arrangement and their relationship boundaries. When he stood up to her, he told her to leave because she wasn't paying for the apartment, which is a key point. She went to her parents, and others are calling him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did he overreact? Was her trip a breach of trust? Did he have the right to kick her out? \n\nHe paid for the apartment alone, so if she's not contributing, maybe using his home as a base for her trip isn't fair. But they had been in a 3-year relationship, and she didn't inform him about the trip months earlier. However, she mentioned she had been planning it for months, but only told him at the last minute. That could be a breach of communication. \n\nHe kicked her out, which seems harsh, but maybe he felt it was necessary because of the living arrangement. The problem is the suddenness and the emotional impact. Breaking up over this might be a reaction to her not respecting his boundaries or vice versa. \n\nHe might have a point about the apartment being his, but relationships require communication and mutual respect. If she planned it without telling him, that's a problem. But his response\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014could be seen as extreme. \n\nOther people's opinions matter too. He's getting called controlling, which might be valid if he's not allowing her autonomy. But if she's not contributing to the household and he's sacrificing financially, maybe his stance is justified. \n\nOverall, the key is mutual respect. If she didn't communicate, she's at fault. If he reacted disproportionately, he's at fault. The answer depends on whether the breakup was a reasonable response to a breach of trust or an overreaction. Given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't respect their agreement and the financial arrangement. So, answer B.\n"
