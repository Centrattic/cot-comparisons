Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation involves a three-year relationship where the man pays for the apartment, and the woman planned a solo trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The apartment is paid for by the man, and the couple has a history of trusting each other because both were cheated on before. The woman had always been into traveling, and the man supported trips when they were together. However, this time she planned a solo trip, which he didn't know about until three days before she left. He argues that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she didn't have a right to stay, and he offered money for a hotel, which she refused.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the living arrangement. The woman didn't inform him about the trip, which he saw as a breach of trust. But the man's response was to kick her out of the house, leading to accusations of being controlling. The man might feel that trust was broken because she didn't share this plan, but did he have the right to evict her over it?\n\nThe apartment is in his name, and she's a roommate. If she didn't pay for it, he could legally ask her to leave, especially if they weren't in a formal lease agreement. However, relationships are emotional, and the sudden eviction might be seen as harsh. The man's reasoning is that since she wasn't contributing to the rent, she had no right to stay, but the emotional aspect complicates things. \n\nThe woman's intention to travel alone might be seen as her personal freedom, which the man didn't agree with, but does that justify ending the relationship so abruptly? The man's actions could be perceived as controlling because he's using the living situation as leverage to end the relationship. Alternatively, if the living arrangement is a business agreement, then his actions are within his rights. \n\nAnother angle is the trust aspect. The couple emphasized trust, but the woman didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach. However, the man's response might have been too extreme. Ending a three-year relationship by evicting her seems drastic, especially if the main issue is communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. The woman didn't inform him, which was wrong, but the man's reaction might have been too harsh. He could have addressed the issue without ending the relationship. However, if he felt that her actions broke trust and he couldn't reconcile that, then his decision might be his prerogative. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the apartment is his and she's a guest, technically he can ask her to leave. However, using that as a means to end the relationship might be seen as manipulative. The community might have mixed reactions, but the answer depends on whether the eviction was a justified consequence of her not paying rent or an emotional overreaction to a disagreement.\n"
