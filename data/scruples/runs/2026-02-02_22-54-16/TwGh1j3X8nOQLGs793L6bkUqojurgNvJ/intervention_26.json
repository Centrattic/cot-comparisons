Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over her surprise backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, context is important. They've been in a relationship for three years, live together in an apartment he pays for entirely. They value trust a lot, both having been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he found out about last minute. He tried to go with her but she refused, saying he wouldn't support it. He then told her to leave, and she did, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the apartment situation. He pays for the house, and she compensates him. So he's the one responsible for the bills. The girlfriend wanted to take a trip that's significant\u2014South America, solo, weeks long. She didn't tell him until 5 days before, which is pretty short notice. He was concerned, especially since she's not paying for the house and he can't afford to keep the apartment alone if she's away for a long time. That seems practical.\n\nHe gave her options: come with him, or leave. He even offered to pay for her hotel if she left, which she refused. His argument was about security and the home being his responsibility. From his perspective, it's about boundaries. He's not a controlling person, but he has the right to manage his finances and living arrangements. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's right to make her own choices is also a factor. She's an adult and has the autonomy to travel. Not telling him for months might have been a breach of communication, but she had the right to plan it. However, the timing was bad. He might have felt betrayed, especially if they had discussed future plans and trust was a cornerstone.\n\nWas his reaction too harsh? Kicking her out of the house because she planned a trip without consulting him might be seen as extreme. Even though he pays for the apartment, she lived there too. Ending the relationship because of a disagreement over a trip could be seen as a decision based on his inability to handle her independence. But if trust was a big part of their relationship, and she didn't communicate this major plan, maybe his reaction was a last straw.\n\nLooking at the options: If the author is right, it's about standing up for his boundaries and the practicality of their living situation. If he's wrong, it's about respecting her autonomy and the fact that she had a right to plan her trip. The key points are communication, trust, and living arrangements. The girlfriend didn't hide her travel interests, but this was a solo trip she planned without informing him. He might feel that not discussing such a significant plan was a breach of trust. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own boundaries and the practical reality of their situation. However, there's nuance here. The decision to end the relationship might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances of her not communicating and the financial responsibilities, it's a valid perspective. The right answer is B.\n"
