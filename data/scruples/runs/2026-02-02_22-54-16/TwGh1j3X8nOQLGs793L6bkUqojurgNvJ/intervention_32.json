Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, which is a bit out of her price range. They split utilities via a meter. He mentions they value trust because both have been cheated on before. She loves traveling and had planned a solo trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about. When he asked if he could join, she said no, explaining it was about self-discovery. He thought she wouldn't go with him, so she didn't tell him. Then an argument happened, and he told her to leave the house, which she did. She went to her parents, and he got calls from people saying he's controlling.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she had no right to stay. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. Communication is a big one. She had planned this trip for months and didn't mention it. That's a major issue. In a relationship, especially one where trust is a focus, not sharing such a big plan could be seen as a breach of trust. However, her reasoning was that he wouldn't have allowed her to go alone. Maybe she thought it would cause conflict, but not disclosing it is still a problem.\n\nThen, the author's reaction: He kicked her out. The apartment is his, and she wasn't paying for it. Legally, he can ask her to leave. But emotionally, this is a big move. His response was immediate and harsh. The argument led to her leaving, and he didn't seem to consider alternatives like waiting for her to come back, discussing it more, or finding a middle ground. Instead, he made an ultimatum: leave or he'd pay for a hotel, which she rejected.\n\nThe problem here is that while she broke trust by not informing him, his reaction might have been overly aggressive. Relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of engaging in dialogue, he resorted to ending the relationship abruptly. That could be seen as a knee-jerk reaction. Also, the fact that he's the one paying for the apartment might mean he felt entitled to control the situation, but that doesn't necessarily justify the way he handled it.\n\nOn the other hand, she had a history of being uncommunicative about her plans, which is a red flag. If trust is a cornerstone of the relationship, then not sharing major life decisions undermines that trust. The author's decision might be seen as a way to protect himself from being in a relationship where he doesn't have mutual respect and communication.\n\nBut was it the right move? Maybe he could have addressed it differently. Instead of making her leave immediately, discussing the issue, setting boundaries, or working through the problem together would have been healthier. His action removed her from the situation without resolution, which might not be the best approach, even if her actions were wrong.\n\nSo, considering both sides: She broke trust by not communicating a significant plan. He reacted by ending the relationship in a way that might be seen as harsh. While her actions are questionable, his response might not be entirely justified. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how he handled the situation, even if her actions contributed to the breakup.\n"
