Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he and his girlfriend lived together in an apartment he paid for. She planned a solo backpacking trip in South America, which she told him about a few days before leaving. He didn't want her to go alone and ended up kicking her out of the house, leading to them breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The apartment is his responsibility, and she's staying there without covering the rent. They had trust issues from past relationships. She was planning this trip for months but didn't inform him until last minute. His response was to tell her to leave, using the fact that she doesn't pay rent as justification.\n\nHmm, so in a relationship, communication is key. If she was planning a trip for months and didn't tell him until a few days before, that's a problem. But was his reaction appropriate? He paid for the apartment, so he might feel it's his decision whether she stays. However, using the trip as a reason to kick her out seems harsh. Maybe he was angry and used the situation as an excuse to end things. Also, his friends are calling him a controlling asshole, which might indicate that his action was seen as extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's paying for the apartment, he might have the right to ask her to leave if they're not on good terms. But since they were in a relationship, that complicates things. Usually, in a shared living situation, even if one partner pays more, both have a right to the space. But maybe they had an understanding where she stayed because he let her. If she broke that understanding by leaving abruptly, maybe his reaction was a way to enforce boundaries. \n\nBut was dumping her over this the right move? He could have addressed the communication issue without ending the relationship. Kicking her out of the house because of a disagreement might be crossing a line. Also, the fact that she went to her parents and he was criticized by others suggests that his action might be seen as extreme. \n\nSo considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation well, reacted impulsively, and used the living arrangement as leverage to end the relationship. The real issue here is the lack of communication from her, but his response was disproportionate. He should have talked things out instead of immediately evicting her. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
