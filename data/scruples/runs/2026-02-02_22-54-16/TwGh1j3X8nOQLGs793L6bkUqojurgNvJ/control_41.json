Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for entirely. She uses a meter to split costs, but he covers the main bill. Both value trust because of past cheating issues. She planned a solo trip for months, announced it last minute, and he kicked her out.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. He mentions she had been planning it for months but didn't tell him. She says she didn't tell him because he wouldn't agree. He felt it was a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, if they live in a place where he pays for the apartment and she's living there without paying, maybe that's a power dynamic. He might feel he has more control over the living situation. But she's his girlfriend, so maybe they didn't have clear boundaries about living arrangements. \n\nWhen she announced the trip, he didn't want her to go. She said he wouldn't allow it. He then told her to leave. Is that controlling? He says he offered money for a hotel. She didn't take it. \n\nBut kicking someone out of your home because they made a life decision without telling you\u2014maybe that's overreacting. However, if they had a mutual understanding about big decisions, like travel plans, then her not discussing it could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was paying for the apartment might mean he felt entitled to some say in her decisions, but that's where the problem is. Relationships require mutual respect. If she wanted to go on a trip and didn't communicate, that's bad. But his response seems extreme. \n\nHe says they were big on trust and communication. If she didn't communicate this major trip, maybe that's a breach. But he could have discussed his concerns without kicking her out. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk it through and see if they could compromise. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't respect her autonomy by kicking her out, then maybe. But if he felt the living arrangement was his and she wasn't contributing, maybe it's a different angle. However, the way he phrased it as a ultimatum seems harsh. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he reacted impulsively and used his financial control over the apartment to force her out instead of addressing the issue through communication. Even if he felt betrayed, kicking her out without considering her needs or the relationship's foundation of trust was a poor decision.\n"
