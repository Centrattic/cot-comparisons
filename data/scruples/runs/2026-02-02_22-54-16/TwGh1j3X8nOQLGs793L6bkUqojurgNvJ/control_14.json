Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's a guy, ended his relationship with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. They lived in an apartment he paid for, and she had been planning this trip for months. He said she didn't have the right to stay because she didn't pay for the apartment, so he told her to leave. Now he's being called a controlling asshole, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to check the key points. They were in a 3-year relationship. The apartment is in his name, he pays for it, and she contributes through a meter. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip, he didn't know about it, and when she told him, he kicked her out. \n\nThe main question is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break down the factors. \n\n1. **Communication**: She didn't tell him about the trip for months. In a relationship where trust is emphasized, not sharing something significant like a major trip could be a breach of trust. But on the other hand, maybe she thought it was something she could do on her own. \n\n2. **Living Situation**: He pays for the apartment. Since she doesn't pay rent, he might feel she's living at his expense. If she's not contributing financially, maybe he felt entitled to set boundaries. However, in a relationship, even if one person pays, it's usually expected that both live together amicably. Kicking her out over a planned trip might be harsh, but maybe he felt it was necessary given his financial contribution.\n\n3. **Reaction to the Situation**: He gave her an ultimatum: either leave or she goes on the trip alone. He offered hotel money but she refused. Is this a controlling act? Controlling behavior usually involves restricting someone's freedom without valid reason. However, if she was leaving anyway, maybe his reaction was a way to enforce his boundaries. But dumping someone over a disagreement about a trip might be seen as extreme, especially if there were no prior issues about travel plans.\n\n4. **Context of Past Relationships**: Both have been in cheating situations before. Maybe there's a history of trust issues. If she didn't communicate the trip, he might feel betrayed. But she says she didn't tell him because he wouldn't agree. That suggests she anticipated conflict, which might not be fair to him.\n\n5. **Legal Aspects**: If the apartment is in his name, she might not have a legal right to stay. However, in many places, if someone is living there as a partner, even if they don't pay rent, they might have some rights. But the user isn't asking about legality, just moral wrong.\n\n6. **Immediate Reaction**: The argument led to her leaving. He might have acted out of anger or hurt, which could be seen as impulsive. Ending a relationship because of a disagreement over travel plans, while significant, might not be justified unless there's a pattern of disrespect or other issues.\n\nConsidering all these points, there are two sides. On one hand, not communicating the trip could be a breach of trust, and he's asserting his right to his home. On the other, ending the relationship over this might be too extreme, especially if the trip was planned and she had the right to make her own decisions. \n\nMaybe the key issue is the lack of communication. In a healthy relationship, major decisions like a solo trip should be discussed. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out immediately, which could be seen as disproportionate. His friends are calling him controlling, which suggests that his actions might have overstepped, even if he felt justified. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the communication breakdown was more significant than the trip itself. If she had been planning it for months without telling him, that's a major issue. But if he didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve the issue before ending things, that could be his fault. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because ending the relationship over a disagreement about a trip, especially without prior conflict about similar issues, might be too harsh. But there's also the aspect of communication and trust. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he's being called controlling, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction was extreme. However, others might argue that he's justified given the circumstances. \n\nBut considering that he's the one who set the boundary and she had a right to leave, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given the context, the answer is likely A (Yes) because kicking someone out of the home they've lived in for three years over a planned trip, even if they don't pay rent, is a severe action. It might indicate a lack of communication and an overreaction.\n"
