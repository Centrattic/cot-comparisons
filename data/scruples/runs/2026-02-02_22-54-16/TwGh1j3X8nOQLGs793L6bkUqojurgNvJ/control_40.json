Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They were in a 3-year relationship, living in an apartment he pays for. She had always been into traveling and had taken trips before. This time, she planned a solo trip across South America without informing him until a few days before. He wanted to join, but she said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and that he'd oppose it. He then told her she could leave the house since he pays for it, and she went to her parents' house.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, trust, and the living arrangement. The user mentions they had trust issues from past relationships, so open communication was important. The girlfriend waited until a few days before the trip to tell him, even though she had been planning it for months. She didn't consult him because she thought he wouldn't agree. The author, in response, decides to end the relationship by kicking her out since she doesn't pay for the apartment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author paid for the apartment, and the girlfriend was a guest. If she was moving out for an extended period, perhaps it's reasonable for him to ask her to leave. But timing is an issue. She told him 5 days before leaving, which might be short notice. However, if she had been planning it for months, why didn't she talk to him earlier? That's a red flag for communication breakdown. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction seems extreme. Ending a 3-year relationship over a solo trip that she had planned but kept secret? Maybe. But he had reasons to feel betrayed, especially if trust was a key part of their relationship. Also, he offered to help with hotel costs, which she refused, which might show he was trying to be supportive but she wasn't open to compromise.\n\nBut kicking someone out of the house they live in because of this? That's a big step. Even if she wasn't paying for the apartment, if it's a shared living space, there might be emotional and legal considerations. However, if the apartment is solely his, then he has the right to ask her to leave. But the emotional impact is significant. \n\nThe friends calling him a controlling asshole might be right or not. It depends on whether his reaction was proportional. Arguing that he has the right to his space is one thing, but ending the relationship over this could be seen as harsh. However, if trust was a cornerstone and she broke it by not communicating, maybe he felt justified. \n\nIn summary, the key issue here is the communication breakdown. She didn't share her plans in a timely manner despite their emphasis on trust. His reaction may be justified if he felt trust was broken, but the way he ended things by kicking her out might be seen as extreme. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how much weight to give to the lack of communication versus the living arrangement. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because while the girlfriend's actions were poor in communication, his response was extreme. Ending a long-term relationship over this, especially without trying to resolve it, could be seen as hasty. But there's also the aspect that he provided for the living situation and had the right to ask her to leave. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the harshness of the reaction compared to the girlfriend's mistake.\n"
