Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the setup: They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for. She wanted a solo backpacking trip, which she planned for months but didn't mention until 5 days before. He didn't know until then, and when he asked to join, she said no. The argument led to him telling her to leave the apartment, which he paid for, and she went to her parents'.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend planned a significant trip without discussing it with her partner, which is a red flag in a relationship. Trust is a big part of their dynamic, so not being upfront about such a major decision undermines that. The author felt betrayed and chose to end the relationship, which he justifies by her not contributing to the apartment. But kicking someone out of the home they share can be seen as extreme, especially if they're in a committed relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple had trust issues from past cheating, the lack of communication here is even more damaging. The girlfriend's secrecy about a major life decision could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's response, while harsh, might be his way of setting boundaries. However, breaking up immediately by evicting her seems abrupt. A more constructive approach might have been to discuss the issue and see if they could work through it. \n\nBut considering that the apartment is his and she wasn't paying for it, he might have a point in terms of not forcing her to stay. Still, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out in a fit of anger\u2014could be seen as impulsive. The fact that she had planned it for months but didn't communicate makes her wrong. But the author's actions might be justified if he felt the trust was broken. \n\nHowever, the immediate breakup without giving her a chance to explain further might be hasty. Relationships require communication, and both parties need to address issues together. The author's decision to end things so quickly, perhaps without a discussion, could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the trust issues and her secrecy, maybe it's a valid stand. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the girlfriend's lack of communication is a significant issue. The author had the right to be upset, but the method of ending things might be too abrupt. However, the fact that the apartment is his and she wasn't contributing financially might mitigate some of the blame. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were a major breach of trust and communication, and the author had the right to set boundaries. However, the way he executed it could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, his reaction is understandable. The core issue was her not involving him in such a significant decision, which is a critical aspect of a relationship.\n"
