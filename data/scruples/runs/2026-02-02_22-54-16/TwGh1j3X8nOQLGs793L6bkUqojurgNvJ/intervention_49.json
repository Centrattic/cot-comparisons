Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The context is they've been together three years, live in an apartment he pays for, and had issues with trust from past relationships.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a solo trip she didn't tell him about. He found out last minute and didn't agree with her going alone. She said he wouldn't allow it, so she didn't tell him. The author then told her she could leave if she wanted to go, leading to her moving out. He offered hotel money, which she refused.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. She didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they value trust highly. However, the author's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. Even if he paid for the apartment, the relationship dynamics matter. His reaction might be seen as controlling or using the living situation against her, which is a red flag.\n\nBut maybe he felt disrespected because she didn't share her plans. She had the right to travel, but the lack of communication is a problem. The author's threat to make her leave might be his way of asserting boundaries, but doing it in a way that's destructive to the relationship. It's a bit of a toss-up between respect for her autonomy and the need for communication in a relationship. The sudden breakup over this might be disproportionate, but the underlying issues (communication, trust) are valid on both sides.\n\nI think the author's actions are harsh, but the situation is complex. He might be reacting to a breach of trust he valued highly. However, using the living situation as leverage to enforce his wishes could be seen as wrong. So, probably answer A (he's in the wrong) because his response was extreme and controlling, even if she didn't communicate properly. Relationships require mutual respect and communication; his reaction undermined that.\n"
