Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple lived in a 2-bedroom apartment that the author paid for entirely. The ex-girlfriend didn't pay rent but compensated through other means. They had trust issues from past relationships and valued communication. She had been planning a solo trip to South America for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving. She said he wouldn't support her going alone. The author responded by telling her to leave his house, which she did, staying with her parents. People called him a controlling asshole, but he's unsure.\n\nHmm, the main issues here are communication and boundaries. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a major life decision, which could be a breach of trust, especially since they emphasized openness. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out of his house, which he owns. But she didn't pay rent, so maybe he had the right to ask her to leave. Yet, breaking up over this might be seen as extreme. Did he give her a chance to resolve the issue, or was it an immediate ultimatum? Also, calling her to leave might be seen as controlling if he used the financial aspect as leverage. But if they were already in an argument and he felt betrayed, maybe he saw it as the only option. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as disrespectful to their communication values. However, the author's response might be harsh. It's a balance between respecting personal freedom and maintaining trust. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some views, ending a relationship over this is too much, but others might see it as standing up for one's own limits. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better without the immediate breakup. So leaning towards B, but not sure. Wait, but was the breakup necessary if the house situation was separate? Maybe the author saw the trip as a deal-breaker. Without more info on their discussions, it's hard. But the girlfriend's surprise could be a breach of trust, and the author's reaction is about his limits. So maybe B is correct.\n"
