Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, some context: They were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment by himself, and they both have a history of trust issues. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America and didn't tell him until a few days before leaving. She mentioned she wanted to \"discover herself\" and thought he wouldn't agree. The author responded by kicking her out, saying she could leave if she wanted, and offered money for a hotel, which she refused. Now, he's getting backlash and is questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, communication, and the power dynamics in the relationship. The author claims the apartment is his, and she doesn't pay for it, so he thought she had no right to demand to stay. But wait, just because he pays for the apartment doesn't mean she can't be there. They're in a relationship, so sharing an apartment is a mutual decision, even if one person pays more. If she's living there as part of the relationship, then her sudden decision to leave might not affect her right to stay, but the author is using the apartment as leverage.\n\nThe argument is about her unannounced trip. She had planned it for months but told him only days before. That could be a breach of communication. However, if the trip was planned for months, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. But she thought he wouldn't approve. Maybe she feared his reaction, which is valid if there's a history of controlling behavior. But then, the author's response was to kick her out, which seems extreme. Instead of a constructive conversation, he used the apartment payment as a reason to remove her, which could be seen as manipulative, especially since he's the one paying for it. That might have given him a sense of control, but it's not healthy.\n\nAlso, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole might indicate that his actions were perceived as such. Trust is important, but so is communication. If she wanted to go on a solo trip, she might have handled it differently, but his response was to end the relationship immediately instead of discussing boundaries. Maybe he didn't consider that her decision to travel alone was her personal choice, which is valid, but not discussing it with him was the issue. However, using the apartment as a justification to kick her out is problematic because it's not fair to use financial contributions as a tool to control living arrangements in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have a say in major decisions, especially if they live together. The author's reaction seems to stem from control rather than a mutual decision. Even though they had trust issues, his action might have been a defense mechanism, but it's not a healthy way to resolve conflict. The girlfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author's response was equally so. So, considering all this, it's a bit of a two-way street, but the main issue is that he used the apartment as a weapon, which is not fair. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
