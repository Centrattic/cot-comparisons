Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip he didn't agree with. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment himself, and she compensates him for her share. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he found out about 5 days before she left. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and didn't tell him earlier because he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone. He got angry, told her to leave, and she did. Now he's called a controlling asshole by others.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and boundaries. The girlfriend planned a trip months in advance but didn't tell him until 5 days before. That seems like a big decision without prior discussion. In a relationship, especially one that's been going for three years, it's reasonable to expect partners to discuss major life plans together. However, the way the author reacted by kicking her out might be seen as extreme. \n\nHe does mention that he's willing to pay for her hotel, which shows he's trying to help, but the ultimatum of \"you can leave without me\" could come off as controlling or dismissive. The fact that he's the one paying for the apartment adds another layer. If she's not contributing financially to the home, maybe that's a point of contention. But in a relationship, people often make financial sacrifices for each other, and expecting her to inform him about plans that affect their living arrangement is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's decision to go on a solo trip might be her personal growth, which is important. However, the way she kept it a secret until the last minute could have been a breach of trust, even if her intention was to explore. The author's reaction might be seen as a response to that breach, given their emphasis on trust. \n\nBut breaking up over this seems harsh. Maybe there could have been a discussion, understanding her need to travel, and finding a compromise. Instead of immediately kicking her out, talking through the issue could have been better. His response was immediate and final, which might be seen as not trying to resolve the conflict. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his feelings about her trip and instead lashed out by ending the relationship, that could be his fault. However, if she violated their agreed-upon communication and trust by keeping such a big decision a secret, then both might share some blame. But the question is about the author specifically. \n\nHe might have acted in the wrong by not addressing the issue with her before making the decision to end the relationship. Instead of giving her an ultimatum, discussing his concerns and working towards a solution would have been healthier. Kicking her out without allowing dialogue could be seen as controlling, even if his reasons were about boundaries. \n\nBut considering the context of their relationship dynamics, where he pays for the apartment and they value trust, his actions might be a reaction to feeling disrespected. The key is whether his action was a justified response to her lack of communication or an overreaction. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's secrecy was problematic, the author's immediate decision to end the relationship without discussion might have been his mistake. So I lean towards saying the author is in the wrong.\n"
