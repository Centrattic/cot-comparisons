Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for ending the relationship after their girlfriend went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The context is that they lived in an apartment he paid for, which is a key point.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they had a policy of trust because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for months without telling him, which he didn't find out until 5 days before she left. He tried to ask if he could join, but she said it was about self-discovery and he wouldn't allow it. The argument led to him telling her to leave, which she did, staying with her parents. He also offers to pay for a hotel, but she refused.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't inform him about a significant decision that affects their living arrangement. The apartment was his responsibility, and if she's leaving for an extended trip, that's a big deal. He might have had to deal with the apartment alone, which he wasn't expecting. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after the argument\u2014seems harsh. Ending a 3-year relationship over this, especially in the heat of the moment, could be seen as impulsive. However, he points out that the apartment is his to pay for, so he might feel justified in setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reason for not telling him is that she thought he'd disapprove. That's a problem too because they should have discussed it regardless. Trust is foundational, and keeping a secret about such a big trip could break that trust. The author's reaction might be a result of feeling betrayed, even if the trip wasn't malicious. \n\nBut is it fair to dump someone just because they didn't communicate a trip that they wanted to take alone? Maybe the author could have had a conversation about the trust and maybe set some boundaries earlier. However, the situation is complex. The girlfriend's actions might have been a breach of the trust they both valued. The author's decision to end the relationship could be a consequence of that breach. \n\nThe key is whether the girlfriend's secret trip was a deal-breaker. If trust was a core value, then her not sharing such a big plan could be justified as a reason to break up. But the immediate reaction of making her leave the apartment might be seen as overly harsh, especially if he was willing to help financially. \n\nI think the answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they had always communicated openly and this was a significant change, the author's reaction might be understandable. But if the trip itself wasn't a red flag and the main issue was the lack of communication, then maybe the author overreacted. However, since trust was a big part of their relationship, her secrecy could be a valid reason to end it. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the lack of communication on such a significant matter might have been a deal-breaker, especially considering their emphasis on trust. But the way he executed the breakup could be seen as harsh. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. Since they both valued trust, her not sharing the plans is a problem. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a result of that broken trust. So, B for No.\n"
