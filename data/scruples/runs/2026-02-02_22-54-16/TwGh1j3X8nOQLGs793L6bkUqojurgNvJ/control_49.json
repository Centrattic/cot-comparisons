Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. They've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, and they have a system where she compensates him for her part. They both value trust because of past issues. \n\nThe girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he found out about only days before she left. He asked to join, but she said it's for self-discovery and he wouldn't let her go. The argument led to her moving out. \n\nNow, considering their living situation: he owns the apartment, she doesn't pay rent directly but compensates him. So, technically, he's in charge of the space. If she wasn't paying rent, maybe he has a point in terms of housing arrangements. But relationships involve mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe key issue is the surprise trip. She was planning it for months but didn't tell him until last minute. That could be seen as a breach of trust. However, she did mention wanting to go alone, which he might not accept. \n\nHis response was to kick her out, which seems harsh. Even if he's the one paying, ending the relationship by forcing her to leave might be too extreme. Maybe a better approach would be discussing boundaries and finding a compromise. \n\nAlso, others called him controlling, which he might be, but if she was planning a significant trip that affects their relationship dynamics, communication was lacking on both sides. \n\nSo, was he wrong? Probably. Ending the relationship by evicting her without prior discussion shows a lack of mature problem-solving. He should have addressed the issue without using the housing situation as leverage. She also should have communicated better. But the main question is about the author's actions. His response was disproportionate, making him at fault.\n"
