Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author and his ex had a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, and they split expenses through a meter. She decided to go on a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she had planned for months but didn't tell him until right before she was leaving. He got upset and told her she could leave the apartment since she didn't pay for it, offering to help with a hotel if needed. She went to her parents' house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: communication, trust, and shared responsibilities. The author mentions they were big on trust. If she had always been open about her travel plans, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But she waited until last minute and didn't share the plan, which he found controlling. However, he is the one paying for the apartment, so maybe he felt ownership over the living situation. \n\nHe says she didn't pay for the apartment, so he feels she has no right to demand to stay. But the apartment is their shared home, even if he pays for it. Kicking someone out of a shared home without a legal reason (like lease issues) might be problematic. Emotional reactions during arguments can lead to hasty decisions. \n\nAlso, she was going on a trip she wanted to do alone, which he didn't agree with. But forcing her to stay or making her leave because of a disagreement on travel plans might be overstepping. Even if he pays for the apartment, mutual respect and communication are key in a relationship. Ending the relationship over this might be harsh, but if they had underlying issues with trust and control, maybe it was a breaking point.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might feel disrespected. However, the way he handled it by kicking her out could be seen as extreme. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss boundaries and perhaps adjust living arrangements if they couldn't agree. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be justified if there were prior issues, but the immediate response of kicking her out seems harsh. It depends on the dynamics of their relationship and how they communicated. But in terms of fairness, maybe the author is in the wrong because using the apartment ownership as leverage to end the relationship seems a bit extreme. So, maybe answer A.\n"
