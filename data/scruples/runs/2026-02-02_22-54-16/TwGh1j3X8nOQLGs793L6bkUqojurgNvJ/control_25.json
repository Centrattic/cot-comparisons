Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author ended his relationship with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip unannounced. The key points here are about trust, communication, and the living arrangement.\n\nFirst, they're in a three-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment entirely, and they split the bill through a meter. The girlfriend was planning a solo trip, which she said she had planned for months but didn't tell him about. When he asked to join, she said no, and he ended up kicking her out of the apartment. Now he's asking if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. So trust is a big part of their relationship. Both have been cheated on before, so they emphasized trust. But she went on a trip without telling him, which seems like a breach of trust. On the other hand, he's the one who pays for the apartment, so maybe he felt he had the right to ask her to leave. But is that fair?\n\nHe says he gave her money for a hotel, which she refused. So maybe he wanted her to leave the apartment, but she didn't take the offer. But she went to her parents' house instead. The problem is, the apartment is his, so technically, if she isn't paying rent, maybe he can ask her to leave. But in a committed relationship, especially a three-year one, sudden eviction might be harsh. Even if she's not paying rent, relationships usually involve mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe fact that she planned a trip for months without telling him might have been a deal-breaker for him. But why didn't she communicate this earlier? Maybe she thought she had the right to do it, but in a relationship where trust is important, not telling him could be seen as a breach. However, the way he handled it by kicking her out immediately might be seen as extreme. Relationships require negotiation, not ultimatums. Maybe he should have discussed his concerns more calmly instead of giving her an ultimatum.\n\nAlso, the fact that people called him a controlling asshole suggests that others might see his actions as overreacting. Even though he's paying for the apartment, ending the relationship by evicting her might not be the right approach. Maybe he should have tried to work through the issue instead of immediately ending things. \n\nBut on the other hand, if trust was a cornerstone of their relationship, and she broke it by not being transparent about her plans, then maybe his reaction was justified. However, the method of ending it by dumping her and kicking her out could be seen as harsh. Relationships are about mutual respect, and if there's a breakdown in communication, both parties might have some responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's decision to end the relationship might be understandable if he felt betrayed by her lack of communication. However, the way he did it\u2014immediately evicting her from the apartment\u2014could be seen as too abrupt and controlling, especially since she wasn't living there for free. Therefore, the answer might be A, meaning he's in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if he felt justified in ending the relationship.\n"
