Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They were in a 3-year relationship. The author paid for the apartment, which is a big deal. They both value trust because of past cheating. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months, but didn't tell him. She said he wouldn't have allowed it. He gets angry and tells her to leave, saying she can live life without his security. She goes to her parents' house, and people call him a controlling asshole. He's unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend had been planning a trip for months but didn't communicate it. The author felt she didn't respect their living arrangement and his financial contribution. He kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment and had no right to demand to stay. But maybe the issue is about communication and mutual respect.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate major life decisions. Even if she wanted to go solo, she should have discussed it with him. However, the author's response of kicking her out and refusing to let her stay might be too extreme. The apartment was his, but he had shared it with her. If she left, maybe there was an alternative, like her staying with family while she went on the trip. By evicting her, he might have overstepped, especially since she had a right to feel she could make her own choices once her part of the living arrangement was covered. Also, the fact that he was paying for the apartment doesn't necessarily mean he has full control over her staying there. They might have agreed she could stay as long as they were together. His reaction could be seen as controlling, especially if the main issue was her not discussing the trip rather than her going. \n\nOn the other hand, if she had been secretive about a major decision that affects their living situation, he has a right to be upset. However, the immediate response of making her leave might be too harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to address the communication issue without severing the relationship. The fact that she had been planning it for months and didn't tell him is a problem, but the author's response could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more maturely. Even if she was at fault for not communicating, his reaction of kicking her out and calling her to leave immediately might be too extreme, leading to the breakup without giving her a chance to explain or resolve the issue. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
