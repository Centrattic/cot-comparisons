Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, they lived in an apartment he paid for. She didn't contribute to the rent except splitting utility costs. They had trust in the relationship because both had been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip she said she had been planning for months, but didn't tell him. He didn't want her to go alone, and when she said he wouldn't allow it, he told her to leave his apartment. She went to her parents, and now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here: Did she have a right to go on the trip? She had been planning it for months, but didn't communicate it. Maybe she thought he wouldn't support her, so she kept it secret. But in a relationship, transparency is important. She did plan it for months, so maybe she should have mentioned it earlier. However, the fact that she kept it a secret could be seen as a breach of trust, even if she thought he wouldn't support her.\n\nThe author kicked her out because she wasn't paying rent. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. So he's standing his ground on the apartment situation. But did he have the right to kick her out? If they were still in a relationship, even if she didn't pay rent, maybe he shouldn't have forced her out. But he decided to break up, so maybe the breakup was mutual. The question is whether his actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, he's standing by his decision because of the trust issues and his contribution to the apartment. On the other hand, a sudden breakup over a planned trip she thought was important to her could be seen as harsh. Also, the way he kicked her out might be seen as controlling, especially if the apartment was shared. Even if she didn't pay rent, the shared living arrangement implies mutual responsibilities.\n\nBut considering their history of trust issues, maybe he felt betrayed. However, the surprise trip didn't necessarily mean betrayal. It's possible she didn't think he'd support her, but that's not an excuse for not communicating. The author's reaction was immediate and final\u2014kicking her out. That might come off as extreme, even if he felt justified. People might argue that a breakup should be about mutual agreement, not a sudden eviction.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's tricky. If he genuinely felt that the trip was a deal-breaker because of the lack of communication, then maybe not. But the way he handled it, using the apartment as leverage, might be seen as unfair, especially if she relied on the apartment. Also, the fact that she was going on her own trip could be her personal growth, which he might be stifling by not allowing her to go. But he also has a right to his own space.\n\nI think there's a balance here. Maybe he wasn't in the wrong for ending the relationship over a fundamental disagreement, but the method of kicking her out might be questionable. However, the user's initial thought was that the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the context, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he stood up for his boundaries, even if the approach was harsh. But others might see it as A. I need to decide based on the typical \"am I the asshole\" perspective. Often, these stories are judged on communication and respect. The author didn't communicate his feelings about the trip, just reacted with an ultimatum. That could be seen as controlling. So maybe A (in the wrong). But the fact that she kept it secret for months is also a point. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Kicking someone out of the house is a big step. So maybe A.\n"
