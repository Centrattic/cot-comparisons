Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context is important. They've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment, and they have a system where the girlfriend compensates him. Trust is a big part of their relationship, given their past experiences with cheating. \n\nThe main issue is the girlfriend planning a solo trip. The author found out she had bought tickets for a solo trip across South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him. She said she wanted to \"discover herself\" and didn't think he would allow it. The author's response was to tell her to leave, citing that she didn't pay for the apartment and he was willing to pay for a hotel. She went to her parents' house, and now he's questioning if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points to consider: communication, boundaries, financial responsibilities, and mutual respect. \n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. Let's analyze both sides. \n\nThe girlfriend had been planning the trip for months and didn't inform him. That's a problem because they value trust and communication. But she did mention it was a solo trip, and the author didn't agree with her going, leading to an argument. His response was to end the relationship by making her leave. \n\nIs that a valid reaction? Well, the author is in a position where he's paying for the apartment. If she's not there, maybe it's his decision to ask her to leave. But the way he handled it might be seen as extreme. However, if the relationship was based on trust and communication, her keeping such a big decision a secret could be a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, she did plan it for months. If they were supposed to communicate openly, not sharing this could be her fault. The author's reaction was to end the relationship immediately. Some might say that was harsh, but if the foundation of the relationship was trust, and she broke that by not being upfront, then the author's decision makes sense. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently. Instead of kicking her out immediately, discussing it and finding a solution might have been better. But given the context of their relationship dynamics, maybe the author felt that this was a deal-breaker. \n\nSo, considering all that, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perception of their actions. If the decision to leave was based on her breaking trust by keeping the trip a secret, then he might not be in the wrong. But if the immediate eviction was too harsh without giving her a chance to explain or adjust plans, then he could be at fault. \n\nI think the key here is that the author felt her actions violated their trust, leading him to end the relationship. If the relationship was built on mutual communication, then her not sharing plans for months is a problem. However, his response of making her leave immediately might be seen as extreme, but maybe justified if they had prior agreements about such trips. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because he stood up for his boundaries, but others might argue he was too controlling. However, given the context of trust being a cornerstone, his reaction could be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
