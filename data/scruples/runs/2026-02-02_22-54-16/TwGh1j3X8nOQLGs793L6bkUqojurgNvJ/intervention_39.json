Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment by himself, and the girlfriend contributes by paying her share of the utilities. They both value trust a lot because they've been cheated on before. The main issue is that the girlfriend planned a solo trip without telling him, which he found unacceptable.\n\nHe says he asked if he could join, but she refused, saying it was about self-discovery. She didn't tell him earlier because she thought he wouldn't let her go. He responded by telling her to leave if she wanted to go alone, and she did. Now he's being called an asshole by others.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. They lived together in a space he paid for, but she contributed her share. The girlfriend's decision to go on a trip alone might be seen as a personal choice, but the fact that she didn't communicate it earlier is a red flag. The author's response was to kick her out, which seems harsh, but maybe he felt it was about boundaries and trust.\n\nTrust is a big factor here. If she didn't tell him about the trip, that could be a breach of trust, especially since they valued transparency. However, he did have the authority over the apartment since he paid for it, so asking her to leave if she wasn't going to communicate might be his way of enforcing boundaries. But was it the right approach? Kicking someone out over a disagreement might be extreme, even if there's a shared space arrangement.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend had plans for months and didn't discuss it. That could be a problem because couples usually discuss major decisions together. But the author's reaction was immediate and severe. Maybe there's a communication breakdown here. He might have felt that her secrecy was a show of disrespect, but retaliating by ending the relationship and asking her to leave might be too much.\n\nAlso, considering their past issues with trust, this situation could have been handled differently. Maybe a discussion to understand each other's needs instead of an immediate breakup. However, the author might have felt that her actions were a betrayal of trust, leading him to take a firm stance.\n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on how one views the balance between personal freedom and relationship boundaries. If the girlfriend's trip was a legitimate personal goal that she kept secret, and the author saw that as unacceptable, then the breakup might be mutual. But the method of ending it by forcing her out might be seen as harsh, especially if the apartment was a shared space despite only him paying. However, if the apartment is his property, he might have the right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing financially in a way he's comfortable with.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response to the breach of trust. If the trip was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe he's justified, but the way he handled it might be seen as extreme. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the immediate and harsh reaction, despite the underlying issues.\n"
