Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and he kicked her out of the apartment they were living in. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They've been in a 3-year relationship. He's the one paying for the apartment, which is a bit out of her budget. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She wanted to go on a solo trip, which he found out 5 days before she left. He didn't agree with her going alone, and in the argument, he told her she could leave if she wanted to go. She took that literally and left, and now people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he was wrong to ask her to leave when she went on this unannounced trip. Let's break it down. The apartment is his, he pays for it, but she's living there. Trust is a big part of their relationship. She planned a trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. She says he wouldn't have allowed it if he knew. When he objects, he gives her an ultimatum: leave the apartment or not go. She leaves, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. In a relationship, communication is crucial, especially when one partner is making a significant decision that affects the other. Even though she had the right to travel, the fact that she didn't inform him for months might be a red flag. They value trust, so maybe he expected her to discuss such a major trip with him. However, he's also in a position where he's the sole provider for the apartment. If she's living there, he might feel that she has a certain level of responsibility to communicate. But is it his place to tell her she can't go? \n\nAnother angle: he offered her money for a hotel, which she refused. That suggests he tried to be accommodating. But the response \"you can, without me or the security of my home\" implies that he's using the living arrangement as leverage. Since he owns the apartment and she's staying there, maybe he's not in the wrong in terms of housing. But relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If she felt the need to lie about the trip because she thought he'd disapprove, that might indicate a breakdown in communication. \n\nHowever, kicking her out over a trip she already planned might be too harsh. Even if she didn't communicate, is that a reason to end the relationship and remove her from the home? It's possible that he's conflating her lack of communication with her not respecting him, leading to a drastic reaction. \n\nAlso, the people around him are calling him a controlling asshole, which could be a sign that his reaction is seen as extreme. But that's not necessarily a reliable indicator. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's the one who owns the apartment and can choose who lives there. So he's not legally or financially in the wrong. But ethically, if the breakup was because of bad communication, maybe he could have handled it better. However, the story says they were big on trust and future plans. If she was being dishonest by hiding the trip, that could undermine trust. \n\nOn the other hand, if he didn't have a reason to prohibit her from traveling, even if he was upset about not being informed, using the housing as a punishment might be seen as controlling. The fact that he was willing to give her money for a hotel shows he wanted to support her, but she refused. So maybe he's within his rights to ask her to leave if he's not comfortable with her staying. \n\nBut the argument was about her not telling him. The trip was planned months ago, but she only told him 5 days before. That's a significant delay in sharing important information. If the relationship was based on honesty, that might be a problem. However, his response was to kick her out, which is a severe action. Even if he felt hurt or betrayed, evicting her might be an overreaction. \n\nI need to consider both sides. If the apartment is his and he's single-handedly paying, he can choose to move out. But in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual support and discussion. Her not telling him about a big trip that she had planned for months could be a breach of trust. But instead of talking it over, he used the housing as a way to end the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the lack of communication justified the breakup. If he had a valid reason to be upset and felt that the trust was broken, then maybe it's his right. However, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to make her leave\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially since she was staying in a place he paid for. \n\nI think the key here is that she didn't communicate the trip, which could have led to a discussion. By not talking about it, she might have felt the need to leave, but he took it as a personal rejection and used the housing to enforce consequences. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's in a position to manage his own property, but the emotional response might be seen as controlling. \n\nHmm, but the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the apartment is his and she was staying there, he can decide who lives there. However, if the reason for ending the relationship is her not informing him, then it's about the communication issue. If he truly believed that her not telling him was a deal-breaker, then he's within his rights. But if he's using that as a pretext to control her behavior, then he's in the wrong. \n\nThe story says they were big on trust. Not informing about a major trip could be a breach of that trust. So, maybe he's justified in breaking up, but the method of kicking her out might be too abrupt. However, since he was willing to offer a hotel and she refused, perhaps he's not the asshole. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No) because he's the one paying for the apartment and the lack of communication from her might have led to the breakup. But it's a bit of a gray area. If he had a right to ask her to leave because of her actions breaking the trust, then he's not in the wrong. But if the breakup was impulsive and not based on actual trust issues, maybe he is. \n\nThe story mentions that she said he wouldn't have allowed her to go, implying she thought he was controlling. But he's not controlling if it's his house. However, using the housing to punish her for a relationship issue might be crossing a line. \n\nMaybe the answer is A (Yes) because even though he owns the apartment, the way he used it as an ultimatum during an argument could be seen as controlling. But others might argue that he's within his rights. \n\nI need to make a decision. Since he's the one paying, he can choose to end the relationship. But the method of doing so by immediately evicting her might be considered harsh. However, the fact that she lied about the trip for months is a serious issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship if he felt her not communicating was a violation of trust. The apartment is his, so he can ask her to leave. But the public reaction is on his side. However, the way he phrased it\u2014using the house as a threat\u2014might be seen as controlling. \n\nWait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't pay for the apartment, then he's not obligated to let her stay. So if she was staying there as part of their relationship, he can choose to end that. The problem is whether the breakup was justified. \n\nIf she didn't communicate a major decision, and they both valued trust, then he had a reason. So he's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
