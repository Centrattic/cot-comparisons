Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They were in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment, which she stays in. They have a strong trust-based relationship, both having been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip across South America and told him last minute, saying he wouldn't have approved. He got angry and asked her to leave the apartment, which she did. Now, he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether his reaction was justified. Let's look at the factors. He mentions he pays for the apartment entirely, and she compensates him. She wanted to go on a trip he didn't agree with. He argues that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to demand staying. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. He then asked her to leave.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is key. She planned this trip for months but didn't tell him until last minute. That could be seen as a lack of communication, especially since they value trust and openness. However, his response of asking her to leave might be too extreme. Breaking up because of a disagreement over travel plans might not be the healthiest approach. Also, the fact that he's the one paying for the apartment complicates things. If the apartment is his, maybe she's there as a guest, and his choice to end the relationship in that way could be seen as using the living situation as leverage, which isn't great.\n\nBut then, if they value trust and communication, the fact that she waited until last minute to tell him about the trip could be a breach of trust. However, the way he reacted might be harsh. Instead of breaking up, discussing the issue and finding a compromise could be better. Ending the relationship immediately by asking her to leave might be seen as controlling, especially if she's moving out because of his actions.\n\nAlso, considering that she went to her parents' house an hour away, maybe she left voluntarily. But the phone calls from people labeling him as a controlling asshole suggest that society might see his action as extreme. \n\nIn terms of rights, if the apartment is solely his, he has the right to ask someone to leave if they're not on the lease. However, in a relationship, such decisions can have emotional repercussions. The core issue here is whether the breakup was a result of a valid reason (lack of communication) or an overreaction (using housing as leverage).\n\nSo, the author's actions could be viewed as wrong because he used the housing situation to end the relationship, which might not be fair unless the living arrangement is part of the agreed-upon terms. If the breakup was a way to enforce his terms without considering her autonomy, he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if she broke trust by keeping a major life decision secret, he has a point. But the method of response is questionable. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was to use housing as leverage, which can be seen as controlling, especially in a relationship where trust was a big focus. However, some might argue that he's within his rights since he pays for the apartment. But the way he handled it, using it as a means to end the relationship, could be seen as wrong.\n"
