Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple has been together for three years. The author pays for their apartment by himself, which is a big deal. They both value trust a lot because they've been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip for South America, which she had been planning for months but didn't tell him until it was about to happen. She said he wouldn't have let her go alone. The argument escalated, and he told her to leave the apartment, which she did, staying with her parents. People are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's questioning if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is the sole provider for the apartment, and his ex didn't pay rent. They had a system where she compensates him for the utilities. The breakup was immediate after she decided to leave. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few aspects. First, the concept of trust. The couple was big on trust, so not informing each other about plans is a red flag. However, the trip was planned months ago, but she didn't disclose it until 5 days before departure. That seems like a breach of trust, especially since they share a lot with each other. \n\nBut then, his reaction was to kick her out immediately. The apartment is his sole responsibility, and she wasn't paying rent. So technically, he's not obligated to keep her there. However, breaking up in the heat of an argument, especially when she's leaving for a trip, might come off as impulsive. \n\nAnother angle: communication. If she had been planning this for months without telling him, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. But the timing of the argument is right before she leaves, which might make it seem like she's using the trip as an excuse. Or maybe she felt that his control over the living situation made her feel restricted. \n\nHe offered money for a hotel, which she refused. That suggests she didn't want to stay in a hotel, maybe preferring to leave the relationship. The act of kicking her out might be seen as harsh, but since he's the one paying for the apartment, perhaps he felt justified. However, the way he phrased it\u2014\"you can leave without me\"\u2014could be interpreted as controlling if he was trying to force her to choose between him and her trip. \n\nAlso, people calling him a controlling asshole is a point. If others perceive his actions as controlling, that might indicate that his response was more about maintaining control rather than a mutual decision. \n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was based on mutual trust, her not disclosing the trip is a bigger issue. But the immediate breakup might have been a reaction to that breach. However, ending a three-year relationship because of a disagreement over a trip, even if it's unannounced, could be seen as extreme. \n\nI'm torn here. The author isn't wrong if the apartment is his and she's not paying rent, but his immediate reaction might have been hasty. The key is whether her decision to go on the trip without communication warranted the breakup. If trust was a foundation, her secrecy is a problem, but his response in the heat of the moment might not have been fair. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he felt that maintaining the relationship required mutual communication, and her not sharing such a big plan for months was a deal-breaker. But the way he handled it could be seen as abrupt and possibly controlling, especially if he's the sole provider and using that as leverage. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a breach of trust or an overreaction. Since he's the one paying for the apartment, he might have felt it's his right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. But the method of breaking up during an argument might not be the healthiest, but not necessarily wrong. So perhaps he's not in the wrong, but there are nuances. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because technically, he's managing the household and she's not fulfilling her part by being secretive. But the other perspective is that breaking up abruptly could be seen as harsh. However, given the context, maybe it's justified.\n"
