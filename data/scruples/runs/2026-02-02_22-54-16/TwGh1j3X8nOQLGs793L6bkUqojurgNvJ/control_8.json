Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, let's look at the context. They were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment, and they both live there. They value trust because they've both been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months. She decided not to tell him because she thought he wouldn't let her go alone. The author then told her she could leave, and she did, moving to her parents' place. He's now being called a controlling asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip, which she had planned for months. She didn't inform the author because she thought he would be against it. The author, instead of discussing it, told her to leave the apartment she was staying in, which he pays for. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which is a problem, especially in a relationship that emphasizes trust. However, the author's response was to kick her out of the apartment they live in. Since he's the one paying for it, he might feel like she's overstepping, but the way he handled it was abrupt. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she doesn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to stay. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, both partners are supposed to be on the same page. The girlfriend's lack of communication was a major issue, but the author's reaction of immediately evicting her and breaking up might be seen as harsh. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't discuss the situation calmly. Instead of expressing his concerns and finding a solution, he told her to leave, which could be seen as controlling, especially if he's using the apartment as leverage. Even though he's the one paying, in a relationship, the dynamics aren't just about money. The way he handled the breakup might be too sudden, not considering the reasons behind her trip. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend not informing him about a major life decision (a solo trip) could also be a breach of trust, which they both valued. So there's a mutual issue here. But the author's reaction might have been the main problem. Instead of addressing the communication breakdown, he acted out of anger, leading to a breakup. \n\nSo, considering both sides, while the girlfriend's lack of communication is a problem, the author's response was possibly too extreme. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle it constructively. However, some might argue that the girlfriend's actions were the root cause. But given the situation, the immediate eviction and breakup without discussion seems hasty and controlling.\n"
