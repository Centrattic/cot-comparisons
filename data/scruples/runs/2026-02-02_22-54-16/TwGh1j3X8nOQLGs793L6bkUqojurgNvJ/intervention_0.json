Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend of three years live together in an apartment that the author pays for entirely. The girlfriend decided to go on a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she had planned for months but didn't tell him about. He found out last minute, and after an argument, he told her to leave the apartment because she wasn't paying for it and didn't need his permission to stay. She left and he's now being called a controlling asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a relationship for three years and trust is a big factor for both, given their past experiences. The apartment is paid for by the author, which is a big deal because she's not contributing financially. He allows her to use the apartment without paying rent, which gives her financial flexibility for their trips and gifts. \n\nNow, the girlfriend planned a solo trip without informing him. He wanted to come, but she said she wanted to do it alone. The argument arose because he felt she was being dishonest by not telling him earlier. When he confronted her, she said he wouldn't allow her to go, which he agreed was true. His response was to tell her to leave the apartment since he was the one paying for it. \n\nIs this a justified reaction? Well, he's the one paying for the apartment, so he has the right to decide who lives there. Legally, if she's not on the lease, he can ask her to leave. But emotionally, this is a breakup over a disagreement about a trip. The question is whether his reaction was too harsh. \n\nOn one hand, he's standing up for his boundaries. If he didn't want her to go on the trip, and she wasn't willing to compromise, maybe ending the relationship was a way to enforce his values. On the other hand, kicking someone out of the house they've lived in for three years over a planned trip might be seen as extreme. The fact that people are calling him a controlling asshole suggests that others might see it as overreacting. \n\nBut the key points here are trust and financial responsibility. Since trust was a cornerstone of their relationship, her not telling him about a major life decision could be seen as breaking that trust. He might feel that if she's going to make big decisions without him, the relationship isn't sustainable. Also, since he's the sole provider for the apartment, he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out during an argument\u2014might come off as harsh. Maybe there were other ways to address the issue, like discussing it calmly and deciding to part ways without the immediate eviction. But given the context of their relationship dynamics, where he's been accommodating her financially, his stance might be seen as justified in terms of setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He made a decision based on his own values and the terms they had about financial responsibilities. However, the manner in which he executed it could be questionable, but the core of his action\u2014maintaining his own space and boundaries\u2014is understandable.\n"
