Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe couple has been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment, and they have a system where the girlfriend compensates him for her share. They both value trust a lot because of past issues with cheating. She had planned a solo trip for months but didn't tell him until last minute. He wanted to go with her, but she refused, saying he wouldn't approve. The author then told her she could leave if she wanted to go, which she did, moving to her parents' place. People are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are communication, trust, and mutual respect. The girlfriend planned a trip for months but didn't inform him. That's a big deal, especially since they live together and he covers the apartment costs. She might have felt her autonomy was important, but not discussing something so significant could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, ending a three-year relationship over a solo trip might be too harsh. The author could have discussed his concerns instead of immediately ending things. The girlfriend might have felt that her independence was being stifled, but the author's approach was confrontational.\n\nTrust is important, but so is communication. If she didn't communicate her plans, that's a problem. However, responding by evicting her might not be the healthiest solution. There could have been a compromise, like adjusting their living arrangements during her trip. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't pay for the apartment, so she had no right to stay. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, there's an expectation of partnership. The way he handled it might have been too abrupt. People might see it as controlling because he's enforcing a rule (she can't stay if she goes) without considering other options, like her staying for a while or them discussing it further.\n\nIn relationships, major decisions that affect the partnership should be discussed. Not doing so can lead to conflict. However, the author's response seems to lack empathy. Instead of understanding her desire to travel, he set a ultimatum. There's a difference between being reasonable about shared living and being controlling. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's lack of communication is a valid issue, the author's reaction was extreme. He could have addressed the problem without ending the relationship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling it more constructively.\n"
