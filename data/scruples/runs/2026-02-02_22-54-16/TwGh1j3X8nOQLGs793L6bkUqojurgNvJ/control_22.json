Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend went on an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, context: They lived in an apartment he paid for, and she didn't contribute equally. They had trust issues from past relationships. She planned a solo trip for months without telling him, and when he found out, he kicked her out. \n\nNow, considering their living arrangement, he paid for the apartment entirely. She didn't have financial responsibility there. Maybe he felt it was his home, and she wasn't respecting his space or the terms they had. But they were in a 3-year relationship, so cohabitation usually involves shared responsibility. Did he have a right to ask her to leave if she didn't pay for the place? Legally, maybe if it's his property and he's the sole renter, he could ask her to leave. But in a relationship, that's more complex. \n\nHe claims they were big on trust. If she kept a major life decision from him, like a months-long trip, that's a breach of trust. But she said she didn't tell him because he wouldn't have supported it. That's a problem too. Communication is key in relationships. She didn't communicate her plans, leading to conflict. \n\nHis reaction was to kick her out. Is that extreme? Some might say he had a right to his space, but ending a relationship over a disagreement about travel plans? That seems harsh. However, if the trust was broken and they had arguments about it, maybe he felt it was the only way. \n\nOthers might argue that he was controlling, especially since he paid for the apartment and used that as leverage. But he also provided her with financial support for other things. She didn't have to stay in the apartment, but she was there. \n\nThe key points are trust, communication, and mutual respect. She didn't communicate her plans, he didn't handle it calmly. The outcome is a breakup, but whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective. Some might say he was justified in needing trust, others might think his reaction was too harsh. But given that he made a choice to end it because of her actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. So probably answer B.\n"
