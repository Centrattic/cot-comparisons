Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The key points here are the context of their living arrangement, their trust issues, and the sudden decision from the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy pays for the apartment alone, and they have a system where she contributes through a meter. They value trust a lot because of past relationships. The girlfriend loved traveling and had planned this trip for months but didn't tell him until the last minute. She decided to go solo, which the author didn't want her to do, especially alone. He then told her to leave the apartment, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the author might feel justified because he paid for the home and wanted to maintain trust. If she went on a trip that he didn't agree with, especially without prior communication, he might see it as a breach of trust. However, she did mention it had been planned for months, so maybe she felt comfortable making that decision independently. The problem is that they didn't discuss it adequately. \n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems harsh. Even if he owns the apartment, relationships require mutual respect. The fact that she had to go to her parents' house suggests that the argument was intense. People might see his response as overreacting, especially because he didn't try to resolve the issue calmly. Instead of confronting her about the trip, he ended the relationship immediately. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had a prior agreement about such trips, maybe her going alone without discussing it first was a problem. But the timeline is tight\u2014three days before the trip. Maybe she didn't inform him earlier because she knew he'd object. The author's point about the apartment being his responsibility might be valid, but using that as a reason to end the relationship might be too extreme. \n\nIn terms of trust, if they were supposed to be big on it, maybe she felt she had the right to travel solo. He might have trusted her if she'd communicated better. The suddenness of her decision and the emotional response from his side might make people think he overstepped. \n\nSo, while there are valid points on both sides, the immediate reaction of cutting her off and making her leave might be seen as disproportionate. Relationships often require compromise, and ending it so abruptly without trying to find a middle ground could be where he went wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
