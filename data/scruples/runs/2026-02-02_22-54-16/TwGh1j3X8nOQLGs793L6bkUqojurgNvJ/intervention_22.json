Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America, which she had been planning for months, but she didn't tell the author. She told him right before the trip, and he didn't like the idea of her going alone. He then told her she could leave his apartment, which he pays for, and she did. Now the author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the apartment situation: the author pays for the apartment and he allows her to live there without contributing financially. So he's the one covering the rent and utilities. She uses her money for other things like gifts and trips. That seems clear. If she's not paying rent, he can control who lives there, right? So if she's not paying, he has the right to ask her to leave. But maybe they had a different agreement?\n\nThe trust aspect is important. They both value trust because of past infidelities. So maybe the surprise trip is seen as a breach of trust? If she didn't tell him about the trip earlier, even though he would have been against it, maybe she broke the trust. On the other hand, if she had informed him and he didn't agree, maybe that would have been a different situation. She didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't allow it. So her decision to go against his possible wishes might be a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction: he told her to leave because he didn't agree with the trip. He offered money for a hotel, which she refused. So he's asserting his right to control their living situation since he's the one paying. If she's not paying rent, he can ask her to leave. But maybe the way he did it was harsh? The immediate kick-out, even if he's the one paying, might be seen as controlling. But considering that he's the one who owns the apartment, he might have the right.\n\nBut maybe they were in a committed relationship, so even though she's not paying rent, kicking her out seems extreme. However, if they were living together in a shared space and he's the sole tenant, then he can evict her. So legally, he might be right. But emotionally, was it the right thing to do? The girlfriend's friends are calling him controlling. That's a red flag. Even if he has the right to ask her to leave, doing so because of a disagreement about a trip might be seen as overreacting.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend had been planning this trip for months. If she didn't tell him about it, that's a problem. But if she had told him earlier, maybe they could have worked it out. The author might have felt betrayed that she didn't communicate her plans. However, breaking up because of a solo trip might be too much. The author's response seems to be a breakup, but maybe the root issue is communication and trust.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author is the one paying for the apartment, so he has the right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. But the reason for doing so is because of a disagreement about her trip. That might be seen as using the apartment as a leverage in the relationship, which could be controlling. But if he had the legal right to ask her to leave, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the breakup was because of a lack of communication and trust issues, it's a mutual problem. However, the author's reaction was immediate and harsh, leading to the breakup. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he had the right to do what he did, but some might see it as controlling. It's a tough call.\n"
