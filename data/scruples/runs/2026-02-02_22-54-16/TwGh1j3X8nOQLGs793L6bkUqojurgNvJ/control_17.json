Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The author lives in a 2-bedroom apartment he pays for entirely. She helps with the bill through a meter system. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. She's always wanted to travel, and they've had fun trips before. Now, she suddenly tells him she's going on a solo backpacking trip across South America. He didn't know about it because she thought he wouldn't let her go alone. They argue, and he tells her she can leave, which she does, going to her parents' house. People are calling him a controlling asshole, but he's wondering if he's right.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. First, their living arrangement: he pays the rent, and she contributes. That's important. She's been planning the trip for months but didn't tell him. That's a big deal because they value trust. When he asks to come with her, she refuses. The argument happens, and he kicks her out. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether his reaction was justified. The author's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she doesn't have a right to stay, and he offered her money for a hotel. But she leaves anyway. \n\nThe problem here is that the decision to kick her out might be a reaction to her breaking a trust. If the relationship was built on trust, and she didn't share something as big as a planned trip, that's a breach. But the timing\u20145 days before departure\u2014also matters. Maybe he felt blindsided. However, breaking up over this might be harsh unless there were prior discussions about communication and trust. \n\nBut wait, the author says she had been planning this for months. If he didn't know about it until 3 days ago, that's a big gap in communication. In a relationship where trust is a cornerstone, not sharing such a significant life decision could be a major issue. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out after the argument\u2014might be seen as extreme. \n\nHe might feel justified because she didn't communicate, but the response of ending the relationship might be too quick. Also, the fact that he's the one paying for the apartment could add to his stress, but the decision to end the relationship over her traveling solo without informing him is debatable. \n\nOthers might see it as controlling because he's using the apartment as leverage. Even if she doesn't pay rent, it's their shared home. Forcing her out because she didn't tell him about the trip could be seen as a power move. Also, the fact that she's going to her parents' house suggests she's not in immediate danger, but the method of ending the relationship seems abrupt. \n\nIn terms of trust, if the relationship was built on honesty, her not sharing the trip could be a deal-breaker. But then again, maybe she had her reasons for not telling him. However, the author's reaction might be over the top. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportional. If the relationship requires mutual communication and she violated that, then the author isn't wrong. But if he used the apartment as a way to control her, then he is. \n\nBut given that they valued trust, and she didn't communicate a major decision, maybe he's not wrong. However, the way he ended it\u2014kicking her out after an argument\u2014might be problematic. It's a balance between his right to live in his apartment and the breach of trust. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards Yes (A), because using the living arrangement as a leverage to end the relationship could be seen as controlling, even if there's a breach of trust. The immediate reaction might be too harsh without giving her a chance to explain or address the issue. Also, the fact that he's using the apartment as a reason to kick her out might be more about control than the actual trust issue. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
