Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together three years, live in an apartment he pays for. She didn't contribute money-wise but helped with the bill through a meter system. They value trust because both had past cheating issues. He pays for the apartment to let her spend on gifts and trips. She planned a solo trip, he didn't know until last minute, argued, then told her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and control. She had planned it for months but kept it secret because she thought he wouldn't agree. He felt betrayed, maybe because of the lack of communication. He responded by kicking her out, which he justified because she didn't pay rent. \n\nIs that fair? Well, trust is a big part of their relationship. If she didn't communicate something big like a solo trip across continents, that's a breach of trust. But was his reaction appropriate? Kicking her out might be extreme, especially if they were in a stable relationship. She might not have told him out of fear, but he could have handled it differently, like setting boundaries or discussing it without evicting her. \n\nAlso, since he pays for the apartment, maybe she didn't have a legal right to stay, but emotionally, relationships are more about mutual respect. His response might have been too harsh, but the initial issue was her not communicating. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Some might say he had the right to ask her to leave if she was being dishonest, others think the conflict could have been resolved without ending the relationship. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because while her secrecy is a problem, his immediate decision to end things might have been too abrupt. He didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve the issue, just kicked her out. That could be seen as controlling or not giving the relationship a chance to work through the problem.\n"
