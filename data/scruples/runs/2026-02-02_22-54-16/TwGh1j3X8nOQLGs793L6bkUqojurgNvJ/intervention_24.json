Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip without telling him. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the couple had been together for three years. The author pays for the apartment entirely, while the girlfriend contributes through a shared meter. They value trust a lot because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip in South America, which she hadn't told him about, saying he wouldn't have allowed it. The author reacted by telling her she could leave, and she did. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and trust. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the trip she had planned for months. That seems like a breach of trust, especially since they emphasized being open with each other. However, maybe the girlfriend felt she needed this trip for personal growth. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems harsh. But given their history of valuing trust, if she lied or kept a big secret, maybe he felt justified. \n\nBut wait, was it a lie? She said she hadn't told him because he wouldn't have approved. If she was planning it for months and didn't communicate, that's a problem. The author's response was immediate and led to her moving out. The question is whether his reaction was in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, breaking up over a disagreement, even about a big secret, might be extreme. On the other hand, if trust is the foundation they've built, and she broke that by hiding something significant, then the breakup could be seen as a consequence of her actions. The author might feel that since he's the one paying for the apartment, she doesn't have a right to stay, which adds to the conflict. \n\nBut was the argument about the trip a valid reason for ending the relationship? Maybe they should have discussed it more. The author's response seems impulsive: \"You can leave my house\" during an argument. That could be seen as overly harsh, even if he felt betrayed. However, given their history of valuing trust, maybe he felt that the betrayal was too much to handle. \n\nI think the author's reaction is a bit extreme. While the girlfriend's lack of communication is definitely a problem, the immediate breakup and kicking her out might not be the right approach. Relationships require communication and efforts to resolve conflicts, not just ultimatums. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because his response was too abrupt and didn't allow for discussion. But others might argue that after a breach of trust, leaving is justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the immediate and harsh response to a problem that could have been discussed. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B is correct if the lack of communication from the girlfriend justifies the breakup. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations in relationships. In some views, the girlfriend's secrecy is worse; in others, the author's reaction is too controlling.\n"
