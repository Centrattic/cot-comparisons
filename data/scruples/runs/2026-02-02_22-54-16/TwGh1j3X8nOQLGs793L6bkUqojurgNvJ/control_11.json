Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ending their 3-year relationship after their girlfriend went on a surprise solo backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and his ex lived in an apartment he paid for. They had a history of valuing trust because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, which she announced just 5 days before leaving. The author didn't know about it, asked to join but was told it was for her to \"discover herself.\" She said he wouldn't allow it if he knew, so she kept it a secret. The author then told her she could leave, as he was the one paying for the apartment, and she went to her parents' house. He's now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user wants me to answer A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break down the arguments.\n\nOn one hand, the author is responsible for the apartment, and the girlfriend didn't pay for it. If she's going to be away for a backpacking trip, it's understandable he might feel like he's shouldering all the costs without her contributing. Also, the girlfriend kept the trip a secret, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if she thought it was for their good. The author felt it was a dealbreaker because they valued trust, so her secrecy might have triggered that. He gave her an ultimatum, but since she's not paying, he might feel justified in ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, ending a 3-year relationship over a surprise trip seems harsh. Maybe there was a lack of communication. The girlfriend might have felt she needed personal time and didn't want to burden the author. The author's reaction of kicking her out immediately could be seen as extreme. Even if she wasn't paying for the apartment, relationships require mutual understanding. The author's response might have been too quick without discussing the situation more.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's secrecy is a point. If they were a couple with trust, she should have communicated her plans. But the author's response was to end the relationship immediately, which some might see as overreacting. The fact that he offered money for a hotel but she refused might show he was trying, but she didn't take it. \n\nI need to weigh the breach of trust vs. the immediate breakup. If trust was a cornerstone, her secrecy is a problem. However, relationships also need compromise. The author's action might be seen as cutting off without giving her a chance to explain or resolve. But since he was paying for the apartment, and she was going to be away for a long time, maybe he felt it was unsustainable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on fairness and communication. The author didn't give her a chance to explain why she didn't tell him earlier. The girlfriend's secrecy is definitely a problem, but the author's immediate reaction could be seen as the asshole move. So maybe the answer is A, the author is wrong. Or B, because the girlfriend was in the wrong for keeping the secret. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, then the author's reaction could be justified. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately and ending the relationship\u2014might be too harsh. Some might say he should have tried to talk things out instead of giving an ultimatum. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of communication. The girlfriend should have been honest about the trip earlier. But the author's response was swift and cut communication off entirely. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling it more maturely. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
