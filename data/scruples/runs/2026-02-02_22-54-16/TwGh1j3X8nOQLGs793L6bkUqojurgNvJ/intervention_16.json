Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after the girlfriend went on a solo backpacking trip that the guy found out about last minute. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple lived in an apartment that the guy paid for entirely. They had a history of valuing trust because both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip, which she had planned for months, but didn't tell him until last minute. The guy didn't want her to go alone and ended up asking her to leave the house.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points are: the guy pays for the apartment, she didn't inform him about the trip until close to the departure, he felt it was a breach of trust, and he asked her to leave. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is crucial. The fact that she planned it for months without telling him is a red flag. He had a right to be upset because she kept something so significant from him, especially given their emphasis on trust. However, kicking her out of the house seems extreme. The apartment is his, and technically, she wasn't paying for it, so he isn't obligated to keep her there. But relationships involve mutual respect and support. Ending things because of a disagreement over travel plans might be seen as too harsh, especially if she wasn't violating any agreements they had about travel. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had always communicated openly and this was a sudden, unspoken decision, then maybe his reaction is justified. The main issue is the lack of communication from her side. But the way he responded by asking her to leave immediately could be seen as harsh. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, and he could have tried to talk it out instead of ending things. \n\nAlso, considering their history of trust issues, her secrecy might have triggered his fears. But the immediate action of making her leave might not have given them a chance to resolve the conflict. However, since the apartment is his, he has the right to ask her out. So he's not necessarily in the wrong for that. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the core issue was her lack of communication and the apartment being his to manage. However, the decision to end the relationship might be a consequence of their inability to resolve the conflict, but the main fault was hers in not informing him earlier.\n"
