Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend compensates him for her portion. They both value trust, having been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which the author didn't know about until 5 days before departure. He refused to come with her because she said he wouldn't support it. Then he told her to leave the apartment since she didn't pay for it, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering their living situation. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend covers her part. So, technically, she's a guest in his home, right? If she's not paying rent, maybe he has the right to ask her to leave if they're no longer together. But wait, they were in a relationship, so it's a shared living arrangement. Even if she's not paying, it's expected that both partners have a say in major decisions. \n\nThe key point is the surprise trip. She planned it for months but didn't tell him. That's a big decision affecting their shared life. The author felt it was a breach of trust or communication. But maybe she didn't think he'd support it, so she kept it a secret. However, in a relationship, major life decisions usually require discussion. \n\nHis reaction was to kick her out. That's extreme. Even though he pays for the apartment, their relationship was supposed to be based on trust. By asking her to leave after an argument, he might be overreacting. Also, the fact that he was willing to pay for a hotel but she refused shows a lack of compromise. \n\nBut he's the one who set up the living situation where he covers the rent. If she wasn't paying, perhaps his stance is that if she wants to leave the relationship, she should leave the house. However, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to make her leave during an argument\u2014could be seen as harsh. Breaking up and immediately asking for her to move out might be too abrupt. \n\nAlso, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole is a red flag. Even if he's right about her not paying for the apartment, the method of handling the situation could be problematic. Maybe a more mature approach would have been to talk about the trip, set boundaries, or negotiate instead of using the breakup as a means to enforce his terms.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend didn't inform him about a significant trip, which could be a breach of communication. But the author could have addressed it through discussion rather than an ultimatum. His solution was immediate and harsh, which might make him the asshole despite the initial issue. So, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because his reaction was disproportionate and maybe controlling, even if there were valid concerns.\n"
