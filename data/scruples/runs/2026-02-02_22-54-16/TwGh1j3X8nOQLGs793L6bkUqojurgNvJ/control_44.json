Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment solo, she compensates him for her share. They value trust a lot because of past cheating issues. She planned a solo trip to South America, didn't tell him until 5 days before, saying he wouldn't approve. He told her she could leave, she went to her parents, and now he's wondering if he was right.\n\nSo, key points here. The main issue is the sudden solo trip. He felt it was a breach of trust or maybe a lack of communication. But she had been planning it for months, which is a bit conflicting. If she had planned it for months, why tell him only 5 days before? That seems like a problem. Maybe she didn't want to discuss it because she knew he'd be against it.\n\nHe kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment. He offered a hotel for a week. She left. He's being called controlling. Is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, in a committed relationship, communication is key. If she had a major trip planned, she should have discussed it with him earlier. But she knew he wouldn't like it, so she hid it. That's a trust issue. However, his reaction was to kick her out, which is pretty drastic. Ending the relationship because of a disagreement on a planned trip might be excessive, but maybe he felt that the lack of communication was a deal-breaker.\n\nHe mentions they were big on trust. If she kept something that important a secret, even knowing he'd be upset, that's a breach of trust. But his response of immediately ending the relationship and kicking her out might be seen as harsh. Maybe she had the right to make her own decisions, even if they disagreed. However, she didn't communicate, which is a problem in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that he pays for the apartment is a factor. If she's living there, maybe they had an understanding, but if she's leaving, maybe that's her choice. But ending the relationship because she didn't tell him about the trip... It's a tough call. Some might say he overreacted, others might think her lack of communication was worse.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), it's a common scenario where both sides have valid points. The key is whether the decision to end the relationship was justified. If the trip was a deal-breaker for him because it went against their communication principles, maybe he isn't the asshole. But if his response was too extreme, then maybe he is.\n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between her right to independence and his need for communication. Since she kept it secret for months, knowing he wouldn't like it, that's a breach of trust. His response, while drastic, might be seen as a consequence of that breach. However, ending a 3-year relationship over this might be seen as harsh unless there were prior issues. But given their emphasis on trust, maybe it's justified. So I'm leaning towards B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
