Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend over an unannounced backpacking trip.\n\nFirst, the main points: They were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment alone, and they split the utilities. Trust is important to both because of past infidelity. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, didn't tell him until 5 days before, said he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone. He told her she could leave, since she didn't pay for the apartment, and she went to her parents' house. Now people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's confused if he was right to dump her over this.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. He paid for the apartment, but they both lived there. She didn't contribute financially to the rent, but other expenses were split. The trip was planned over months, but she didn't discuss it with him. The key issue here is communication. In a relationship, especially one that values trust, major decisions like extended solo travel might be expected to be discussed. However, she might have felt it was her personal choice, given their past issues with controlling relationships. \n\nWhen he kicked her out, he was technically correct in the sense that she wasn't paying rent, but relationships require mutual respect and understanding. Ending the relationship over this might be seen as abrupt or harsh. However, if he felt betrayed because she kept such a big secret, his reaction could be seen as justified. \n\nThe line he crossed was telling her to leave and not allowing her to stay. Even if he was paying for the apartment, it's a living arrangement they both agreed to. Making her leave because of this might be seen as controlling, especially since he was the one providing the home. People might argue that he should have handled it differently, maybe by discussing boundaries earlier. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which could be seen as a breach of trust. If they valued openness, her secrecy might have been the bigger issue. But breaking up by kicking her out could come off as extreme. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions might be viewed as wrong because of the way he ended the relationship, even if the underlying issues were valid. The method of breaking up was confrontational and possibly unfair given their living situation. Answer A.\n"
