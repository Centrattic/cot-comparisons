Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment, they split utilities. The girlfriend planned a solo trip without telling him, which she said he wouldn't have wanted her to take. The author confronted her, and during an argument, told her to leave the apartment, which she did, staying with her parents. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the communication breakdown and the sudden action of kicking her out. The girlfriend had been planning this for months but didn't inform him until it was imminent. The author felt that since he paid for the apartment, she didn't have the right to demand to stay. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the apartment is in his name, it's their shared home. Kicking someone out suddenly, without a plan for her housing, especially in an emergency or stressful situation, might not be fair. The fact that she had already left and he didn't provide the hotel money he mentioned (which he offered but she refused) complicates things. \n\nAlso, the reason for the breakup was her unannounced trip. But if the relationship is built on trust, why was this so much of an issue? Maybe they had prior discussions about travel and boundaries? The post doesn't mention that. The argument seems to be that her planning the trip secretly and him reacting by ending things was a misstep. \n\nThe author's action of telling her to leave the apartment immediately might be seen as harsh, especially since the trip was already planned and she was leaving in a few days. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk through the issues, address why the secret trip was a problem, and then decide whether to continue the relationship. Kicking her out on the spot could be seen as impulsive or controlling, even if he's the one paying for the apartment. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that others called him a controlling asshole might indicate that his reaction was disproportionate. The girlfriend's right to personal space and travel is valid, but the timing and communication of her plan were poor. However, the author's response of immediate eviction without considering her need for housing could be the real issue here. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, expectations and communication are key. If they had discussed travel plans before and she went against those expectations, it's a problem. But if this was the first time and she had a right to her independence, then the author might have overreacted. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because his response was extreme and didn't provide a solution for her housing, and it might have been a reaction based on his own insecurities rather than a fair resolution.\n"
