Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for three years. They live in an apartment the guy pays for, and they have a system where she compensates him for her share. They trust each other a lot. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, which she had been planning for months. She didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't approve. The guy then kicked her out of the apartment, which he owns, and she left. Now, people are calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the suddenness of the trip, the lack of communication, and the guy's reaction. The girlfriend didn't inform him, which might have been a breach of trust since they value trust highly. But he decided to end the relationship by kicking her out. Was that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the apartment is his, and she didn't pay for it. So he has the legal right to ask her to leave. But emotionally, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If she planned this trip without discussing it, maybe she was being selfish or didn't respect his feelings. But the guy's response was immediate and severe\u2014ending the relationship by removing her from the home they shared. That could be seen as overreacting, especially since they were in a long-term relationship. \n\nHe mentions that she didn't have the right to demand to stay because she didn't pay for the apartment. But they were in a relationship, so maybe there's an unspoken agreement about living together. Kicking her out without a warning or discussion might be harsh. Also, the way he phrased it, \"you can go live life to the fullest without me,\" could be seen as a harsh ultimatum. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been disrespectful in not discussing the trip, but the guy's response might be too extreme. Relationships need compromise. If he was upset, maybe talking it out and finding a solution would have been better than an immediate breakup. Also, considering the context of their past issues with trust, this might have triggered him. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he has the right to his home, but using that as a leverage to end the relationship might be seen as controlling. The people calling him an asshole might have a point because of how he handled it. However, the girlfriend's lack of communication is also a problem. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the guy's reaction was proportionate. Ending a three-year relationship by kicking her out because of a planned solo trip, even if it was a surprise, might be too harsh. He could have addressed the issue, discussed boundaries, or considered her travel aspirations. Instead, he used his ownership of the apartment as a way to force her out, which might be seen as inconsiderate of their relationship dynamics. So, the author is likely in the wrong because his response was extreme and not a proportionate way to handle the situation. He should have communicated better rather than using his living situation as a weapon.\n"
