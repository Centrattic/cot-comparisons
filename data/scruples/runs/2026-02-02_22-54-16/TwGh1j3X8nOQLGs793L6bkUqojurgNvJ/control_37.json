Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, context: They were in a 3-year relationship. He paid for the apartment, she contributed to the bill. There's a history of trust issues because both have been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip across South America, which he didn't know about until 5 days before she left. She said she wanted to discover herself and he didn't want her to go alone. Their argument led to him telling her to leave his apartment since she didn't pay for it, and she went to her parents' house. Now he's being called an asshole, and he's asking if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reasoning is that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she has no right to stay. But she's his girlfriend, and they live together. Even if he pays the rent, it's their shared home. Kicking someone out of their home over a disagreement, especially without prior notice, seems harsh. Even if he's upset, there's a difference between being upset and evicting someone. \n\nAlso, she had planned the trip for months. He says she said he would have stopped her if she told him. But if she planned it for months, why didn't she mention it earlier? Maybe she didn't want to argue, but keeping a trip secret for months could be a breach of trust. But they've always been open, so maybe she felt she couldn't talk to him about it. \n\nThe author's response was to kick her out. That's a drastic measure. Even if he's paying for the apartment, ending the relationship by making her leave immediately is extreme. Maybe there could have been a discussion, some compromise. Also, he offered money for a hotel, which she refused. But that doesn't justify the immediate eviction. \n\nThe fact that others called him an asshole is a clue. People often react emotionally in breakups, but the action itself seems harsh. The author might have had valid concerns about safety and the sudden trip, but the way he handled it was confrontational. In a healthy relationship, communication and finding a solution together is key. Throwing her out of the house without a plan might have been too much. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was a pre-existing agreement about living arrangements, maybe it's different. But since it's a living together situation, it's unclear if there were terms about such trips. The author might have felt his trust was broken by the secrecy, but the reaction was extreme. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of kicking her out seems to be in the wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
