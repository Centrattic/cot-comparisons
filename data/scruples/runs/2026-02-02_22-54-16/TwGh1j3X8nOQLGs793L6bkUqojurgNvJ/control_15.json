Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment alone, splits utility costs via a meter. They value trust because they've both been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America, didn't tell him because she thought he'd object. The author told her she could leave if she wanted to go alone, leading to her moving out and people calling him a controlling asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't force her to stay. He offered to let her leave, even offered money for a hotel. He pays for the apartment himself, so he's not obligating her to stay. The issue is the communication. The girlfriend didn't consult him about a major decision that affects their living arrangement. But she thought he wouldn't agree, so she kept it secret.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, they were supposed to be open. Her keeping this a secret might breach that trust. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme. But he's within his rights since he's the one paying for the apartment. The question is whether his actions were justified. \n\nHe didn't force her to stay; he gave her the choice. So, maybe he's not wrong. But some might argue that communication could have been better. However, given the context of their mutual emphasis on trust and transparency, her secrecy might have been a dealbreaker. His response was direct but not abusive. So, B (Not in the wrong).\n"
