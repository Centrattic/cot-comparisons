Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him. He found out, they argued, and he told her to leave the apartment he pays for. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the apartment is his to pay for, and they have a setup where she compensates him for her share. He mentions they have trust issues from past relationships, so communication is important. The girlfriend wanted to go on a trip she had planned for months, but didn't tell him until last minute. She said he wouldn't have agreed to her going alone, which he seems to agree with. When he objects, he kicks her out, even offering hotel money, which she refused.\n\nNow, considering the factors: Did she have a right to go on the trip? It seems she planned it for months, but didn't communicate it. Maybe she knew he'd be upset, but keeping it a secret until last minute could be an issue. The apartment is his, so he's not obligated to let her live there. But they were in a 3-year relationship. Kicking someone out over a disagreement might be abrupt. However, since he's the one paying, maybe he has some say. \n\nBut wait, in a committed relationship, both partners usually expect mutual respect and communication. If she had discussed the trip earlier, even if he didn't agree, maybe they could have found a compromise. But she kept it a secret, which might have broken trust. On the other hand, his response was to kick her out, which is a major action. Was that necessary? Maybe he felt disrespected by her secrecy, but ending the relationship by eviction might be harsh. \n\nHe mentions they value trust, so her secrecy could be seen as violating that. However, the way he reacted\u2014threatening to make her leave\u2014might come off as controlling, even if the apartment is his. People in relationships usually cohabitate with mutual agreement to stay. If he unilaterally decides to end the relationship by removing her, even if she's not paying rent, it could be seen as extreme. \n\nBut then again, if the relationship is based on mutual living arrangements and she's not fulfilling her part (like compensating for her share), maybe he's justified. However, the main issue here is the surprise trip, not the payment. The core is about communication and trust. If she withheld important plans, that's a problem. But his reaction\u2014kicking her out immediately\u2014might have been too much, especially if there was no prior discussion about boundaries around travel. \n\nSo, was he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, she didn't communicate her plans, which is a big deal. On the other, cutting things off immediately without a discussion could be seen as harsh. But since he's the one paying for the apartment, he might have the right to ask her to leave if they're not in agreement. However, in a relationship, such a decision usually requires some negotiation. \n\nOverall, maybe he's not entirely wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries regarding the apartment, but his approach might have been too extreme. Alternatively, she should have communicated better. But the answer depends on cultural norms and how relationships are handled. In some views, he's justified; in others, it's too abrupt. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe the answer is yes because his reaction was disproportionate. Or no because he's enforcing the living situation he set up. Hmm.\n"
