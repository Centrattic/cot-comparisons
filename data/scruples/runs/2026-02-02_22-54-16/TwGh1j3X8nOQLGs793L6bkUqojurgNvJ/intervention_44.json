Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend going on a solo backpacking trip without telling her boyfriend, and he dumps her because she didn't inform him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They've been in a 3-year relationship, living in an apartment he pays for. They value trust, especially because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend went on a solo trip she'd planned for months, but didn't tell him until last minute. He felt she didn't respect their living arrangement or the trust they had.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend had a right to her own life and interests, like traveling. But maybe she should have communicated better. She said he wouldn't have allowed her to go alone, so she kept it secret. That could be seen as a lack of trust on her part. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a drastic decision\u2014kicking her out of the house. Even though he paid for the apartment, they were in a committed relationship, so maybe he overreacted. The girlfriend might have expected him to support her trip despite the short notice. \n\nBut considering their emphasis on trust, the lack of communication from her might have been a deal-breaker for him. He did offer to help with a hotel, but she refused. It's possible that the author felt betrayed because she didn't respect their living situation and trust. \n\nHowever, ending the relationship over this might be too harsh. Maybe they could have worked it out. But the author might believe that trust was broken, and since they had been open about their expectations, her secrecy was a problem. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans and the author felt it was a breach of trust, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But kicking someone out of the house over a disagreement could be seen as extreme. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the situation involved a breakdown in communication and trust, which are important in their relationship. The author might have had valid reasons based on their mutual values.\n"
