Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip without telling him, and when he found out, he kicked her out of their apartment because she wasn't paying for it. The main points to consider are communication, trust, and the living arrangement.\n\nFirst, the apartment is paid for by the author alone, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share. They've been in a 3-year relationship with trust being a big part. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip, which he didn't agree with. She said she was going to go despite his disapproval because she wanted to \"discover herself.\" When he confronted her, he told her to leave the house if she wanted to go. She left and stayed with her parents. Now he's being accused of being controlling.\n\nHmm. The key issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't tell him about the trip she had been planning for months. That's a problem because they were supposed to be open with each other. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out. That seems harsh, even if the apartment is his. Maybe he overreacted? \n\nBut then again, if she wasn't paying for the apartment, maybe he felt justified in asking her to leave if she wasn't part of the agreement. However, relationships require mutual respect. Even if she didn't pay for the apartment, she's part of the relationship, and her decision to go on a solo trip might be a personal choice. The fact that he used the living arrangement as leverage might have been a mistake. \n\nAlso, the argument about control comes into play. By threatening to ask her to leave if she didn't comply with his wishes, he might be seen as controlling. But if he's the one paying for the apartment, does he have the right to set boundaries? It's complicated. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which is a breach of trust. But the author's response was to end the relationship by kicking her out. Maybe he should have tried to talk it through instead of using the house as a bargaining chip. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's lack of communication is definitely a problem. But the author's reaction could be seen as excessive. Ending the relationship over a disagreement about a trip, even if it's unannounced, might be too much. They might have resolved it without breaking up. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is partly at fault for overreacting. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue and find a compromise, not to use the house as a tool to force her hand. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, that he's in the wrong.\n"
