Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a surprise backpacking trip. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple lived in an apartment where the guy paid the rent entirely. She contributed through a meter and helped with expenses, but he was the sole payer. They both valued trust, given their past issues with cheating. The girl had planned a solo trip to South America, which she hadn't told him about. When he found out, he said she could leave if she wanted to go alone, leading to her moving out. He's now being called a controlling asshole.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The woman planned a trip she wanted to do alone, which he didn't agree with. He allowed her to leave the house, which he owned, and even offered money for a hotel. The issue is whether he overstepped by using the breakup as a reaction to her going on a trip she wanted. \n\nOn one hand, he might have felt betrayed because she didn't communicate this major decision. On the other, controlling her travel plans could be seen as controlling, especially if it's a personal choice she's making. However, since she didn't pay for the apartment, maybe he felt he could set the terms. But relationships typically require mutual respect and communication. If she had discussed the trip with him earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. Instead, she didn't, so he reacted by ending the relationship. \n\nIs it his right to use that as a reason to break up? Well, breaking up because of a disagreement on travel plans might be harsh, especially if the trip was important to her. However, if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, then maybe it's justified. But the line between standing by your values and being controlling can be thin. \n\nHe might have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries earlier. But he did give her the option to leave, which he was willing to support financially. The key here is whether the breakup was about the principle of her going without consent or if he was being overly possessive. Since the apartment is his and she's not a financial co-owner, maybe he had the right to set those terms. However, relationships are about partnership, so his reaction could be seen as prioritizing control over open communication. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. But since he allowed her to leave without force and the breakup was her choice in a way (by going on the trip), maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that pressuring her to stay by threatening to end the relationship is controlling. However, others might see it as a matter of personal boundaries. The answer could depend on cultural or personal perspectives. But given the information, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because he stood by his values and the living arrangement was his to manage.\n"
