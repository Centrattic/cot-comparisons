Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip that she hadn't told him about. \n\nFirst, the context: they've been together three years, live in an apartment he pays for, she helps with utilities. Both value trust because they've been cheated on before. She loves traveling and had planned this trip for months, but didn't tell him because she thought he wouldn't agree. He felt hurt, maybe breached of trust, and told her she could leave. She went to her parents' house, and now people are calling him a controlling asshole. \n\nSo, key points here. She had planned the trip for months but didn't discuss it with him. He felt the need to kick her out because he pays for the apartment. But wait, they live together, so even if he pays the rent, if they're a couple, it's expected some level of communication. She didn't inform him about something significant. \n\nHe's upset because he didn't know about the trip until last minute. But why didn't she talk to him earlier? The trip was months planned. Maybe she thought it was her right to go, but in a serious relationship, big decisions like that might need discussion. \n\nHe says he was willing to give her money for a hotel, but she refused. Maybe he felt it was a way to be accommodating, but she didn't want to take it. \n\nBut the way he handled it\u2014telling her to leave\u2014might be seen as extreme. Breaking up because she went on a trip without telling him could be seen as overreacting, especially if the trip was planned but she just didn't communicate. \n\nHowever, considering they were big on trust, maybe he felt the lack of communication was a breach of trust. But if she had a reason to go alone (like self-discovery) and he didn't support it, maybe the relationship had underlying issues. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, kicking someone out of the house after an argument might be seen as harsh. Even if she didn't pay rent, she's his partner. Maybe he should have discussed it more, tried to find a compromise instead of ending the relationship. \n\nBut on the other hand, if they were in a place where both expected each other to communicate about major life decisions, then not discussing a months-long trip is a breach. The fact that she said he wouldn't allow it might indicate she didn't consider his feelings. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to a breach of trust. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out of their home\u2014could be seen as disproportionate. The answer might be A (he's wrong) because breaking up over this without communication might be too much. But others might say she didn't respect him by not discussing the trip. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether hiding a major life decision (a months-long trip) is a breach of trust. If the relationship was built on trust, her secrecy could be a problem. However, he could have handled it better than just evicting her. So maybe he's not wrong, but maybe he is because of how he reacted. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often argue both sides. But the main issue is the lack of communication from her. He might feel justified in breaking up if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker. But the immediate action of kicking her out might be seen as wrong. So maybe A (he's wrong) because he didn't give her a chance to explain or work through it. But if the lack of communication was a deal-breaker for him, then B (not wrong). It's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A. Because even if she didn't communicate, his reaction was extreme. Ending a 3-year relationship over this without trying to resolve it might be hasty. So he's in the wrong.\n"
