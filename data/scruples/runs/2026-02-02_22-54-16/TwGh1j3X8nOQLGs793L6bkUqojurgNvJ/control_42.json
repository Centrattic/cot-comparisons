Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip to South America without telling him, and he kicked her out of their apartment because he pays for it. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together for three years, live in an apartment he pays for, and have a trust-based relationship. She wanted to go on this trip, which he didn't agree to. She said he wouldn't have allowed it if she'd told him. He responded by telling her to leave, using the fact that she doesn't pay rent as justification. She went to her parents' house, and he got criticized for being controlling.\n\nNow, considering their living arrangement: he pays for the apartment, and she compensates through the meter. So, technically, she doesn't have a legal right to stay there. But relationships are more than just legal stuff. Even if he pays the rent, they're in a partnership. She's been living there for three years, so it's not like it's just his place. The trust aspect is important too\u2014they were supposed to be open with each other.\n\nWhen she planned the trip, she didn't tell him because she thought he'd say no. That's a problem because they're supposed to be honest. But then, when confronted, he didn't address the issue of the trip in a relationship-appropriate way. Instead, he told her to leave. That seems extreme. Kicking someone out of a shared home over a disagreement, even if you pay for it, might be seen as overreacting. Especially since they were supposed to be a team, and she had been planning this trip for months. Maybe he could have discussed his concerns, like feeling neglected or the logistics of her being away, instead of ending things abruptly.\n\nAlso, he offered to give her money for a hotel, which she refused. So he didn't just kick her out without support. But even still, the way he handled the argument might have been the issue. The fact that others called him controlling suggests that his reaction was perceived as too harsh, even if he had valid reasons. Maybe he should have tried to find a compromise instead of breaking up over it. The question is, was his action justified?\n\nOn one hand, if she's not paying rent, he could argue she doesn't need permission to stay. But in a relationship, shared living spaces usually require mutual respect and communication. If she left suddenly, maybe he should have given her more time to leave instead of doing it on the spot. Also, the fact that she was going alone might be a concern for him, but that's something they should have discussed. Kicking her out immediately seems like a drastic move that could be seen as disrespectful to their relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he might have had the legal right to ask her to leave, the way he handled it without prior discussion and during a heated argument might make him look like the asshole. The trust and communication in their relationship were supposed to be strong, so his reaction might have been the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014he is in the wrong.\n"
