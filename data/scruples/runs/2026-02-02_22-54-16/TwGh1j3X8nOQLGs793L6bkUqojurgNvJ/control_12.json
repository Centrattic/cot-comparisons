Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, they've been in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment entirely, and they split the utilities through a meter. The ex wanted to go on a solo trip in South America, which she had planned for months. She told him she wouldn't have gone if he was against it, so she kept it a secret. The author, feeling that she didn't respect their living arrangement (since he pays for the apartment), told her to leave. She went to her parents' house, and he got criticized for being controlling.\n\nHmm. Key points here: communication, trust, living arrangements. They emphasized trust because both had been cheated on before. The author's argument was that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she had no right to stay. But wait, they were living together as a couple. So, even if he pays for the apartment, it's a shared living space. If she left, it's her choice, but kicking her out over a disagreement about travel plans might be harsh. \n\nAlso, she had planned the trip for months and thought he wouldn't approve. Maybe she thought she was being considerate, but keeping it a secret led to a breach of trust. The author's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave, which seems extreme. Even if he's upset about the secret, the solution was breaking up, which might be a reaction driven by anger rather than a proportional response. \n\nBut the author's defense is about trust and living arrangements. If she left the apartment unannounced, maybe he was right to question the living situation. However, ending the relationship immediately seems drastic. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If she felt the need to keep the trip a secret, that's a problem in itself, but the author's response of kicking her out without trying to resolve the issue might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because his reaction was extreme. The problem was a lack of communication from both sides, but ending the relationship immediately by asking her to leave without discussion could be seen as controlling or not handling the conflict properly. The fact that others called him a controlling asshole might be valid because he didn't try to address the issue before deciding to break up. Instead of working through the issue, he used the apartment payment as leverage to end the relationship, which can be seen as manipulative.\n"
