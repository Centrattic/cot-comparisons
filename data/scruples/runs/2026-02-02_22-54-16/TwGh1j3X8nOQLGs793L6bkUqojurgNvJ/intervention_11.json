Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip. The situation is that they were in a 3-year relationship. The author pays for the apartment, and the girlfriend, who had always wanted to travel, planned a solo backpacking trip to South America. When he found out she'd been planning it for months and didn't tell him, he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. Both had been in relationships where they were cheated on, so trust was important. The author mentions he pays for the apartment alone, and she compensates him for her share. She wanted to go on the trip, but he didn't agree with her going solo. He says he offered money for a hotel, but she refused.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip she had planned for months, which he found out only days before she left. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a significant step. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend had the right to travel, but not communicating such a major decision could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they emphasized trust in their relationship. However, the author's response was to end the relationship immediately and have her leave. That seems a bit harsh, even if the girlfriend made a mistake. Ending a 3-year relationship over this might be a disproportionate reaction, unless there were other underlying issues.\n\nThe author's justification is that since he pays for the apartment, she doesn't have a right to stay. But that might be a bit of a legalistic view. Relationships are about emotional support and partnership, not just financial arrangements. If he was upset about her not being honest, maybe a conversation to address the issue would have been better than immediate eviction. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasoning for not telling him was that she thought he wouldn't support her. That could indicate a lack of confidence in their communication. However, the author's response of ending the relationship might have been a reaction to feeling betrayed, but it's important to consider whether the girlfriend's actions were a mistake in judgment rather than malicious intent.\n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend did wrong by not communicating her plans, the author's response of ending the relationship so abruptly could be seen as excessive. There's a middle ground where both could have discussed the issue and found a compromise. So the author might be in the wrong for not handling it with more patience and understanding.\n"
