Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple lived in an apartment that the man pays for entirely. The woman had planned a solo trip across South America and told him about it only days before leaving. She said he wouldn't have wanted her to go alone, which he thought was true. He responds by telling her to leave the apartment, which she does, moving in with her parents. The man then gets criticized for being controlling.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the apartment is his, and she's there at his expense. They've been in a trusting relationship because both were cheated on before. She wanted to do a solo trip, which he didn't like, but she felt it was important for her personal growth. He kicks her out because she's not paying for the apartment, and she refuses his offer for hotel money.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, legally, since he owns the apartment and pays for it, he can ask her to leave. But emotionally, it's more complex. The key issue is communication. She planned the trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before. That's a big decision not discussed. However, he did offer to help with funds, which she refused. \n\nBut the way he reacted\u2014telling her to leave the apartment\u2014might be seen as extreme. Even if she's not paying rent, breaking up because of a disagreement over a trip could be seen as harsh. However, if they had mutual trust and he felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe he didn't have to be an asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he had the right to set boundaries. If he didn't support her decision, maybe moving out was his choice. But dumping her over this alone might not be justified, especially if they had a history of trust. \n\nI think the main points are: Did he have the right to ask her to leave? Legally, yes. Emotionally, maybe not if he could have handled it without ending the relationship. But he might not be wrong for prioritizing his own feelings. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's within his rights, but maybe there's a nuance where the way he handled it was abrupt. However, the story is from his perspective, and he thought it was right because she wasn't paying for the apartment. So, maybe B.\n"
