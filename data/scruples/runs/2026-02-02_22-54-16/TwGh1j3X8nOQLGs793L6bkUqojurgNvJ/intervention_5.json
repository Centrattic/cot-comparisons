Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. The story is from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so they're looking for a judgment on if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple lived in an apartment the guy paid for entirely. The girl had been planning a solo trip across South America for months, but didn't tell him until 5 days before she left. He felt she didn't communicate this important decision, which he didn't agree with. He then told her to leave the apartment, which she did, and now people are calling him a controlling asshole. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nKey points: The girlfriend didn't communicate her plan for a solo trip, which the guy didn't agree with. He didn't force her to stay; he gave her the option to leave, even offering money for a hotel. The apartment is his, and she wasn't paying rent. The couple had issues with trust in the past, which makes communication even more critical.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, communication is usually key. If one partner makes a major life decision without discussing it, that's a problem. The girlfriend planned a trip for months without telling him, which led to conflict. The guy's reaction was to kick her out, which might seem harsh, but since he owns the apartment and she's not paying rent, he has the legal right to ask her to leave. However, emotionally, this might be seen as extreme because he ended the relationship over this.\n\nBut the bigger issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend had a history of wanting to travel, so maybe she should have discussed this earlier. The guy, on the other hand, could have tried to find a compromise instead of ending things abruptly. However, given their mutual history of trust issues and the apartment situation, he might feel justified in protecting his space and his boundaries.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the challenge is whether his reaction was proportionate. Ending a relationship over a disagreement about a trip, even if it's a deal-breaker for him, might be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, like the apartment ownership and trust issues, maybe it's a reasonable boundary for him.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The girlfriend didn't communicate, which was wrong. The guy's reaction was extreme but might be his way of enforcing boundaries. However, in terms of the subreddit's \"asshole\" criteria, if the author's actions were the main issue, he might be the asshole. But if both parties contributed, maybe not. \n\nIn Reddit's AITA, often the person is considered the asshole if their reaction is disproportionate or if they had the upper hand. Here, the guy had the power to ask her out, but the problem was her lack of communication. However, ending a relationship over this, even if it's his home, might be seen as an overreaction. Therefore, the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) because he prioritized his living arrangement over the relationship in a way that might seem controlling, even if he has valid reasons.\n"
