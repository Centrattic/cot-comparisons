Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The key points here are the context of their living situation, their trust issues, and the sudden decision.\n\nFirst, the apartment situation: The author pays for everything, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share using a meter. This is a financial arrangement where he's covering most of the costs. The girlfriend planned a solo trip that he wasn't aware of until a few days before she left. He felt it was a betrayal because they had always been open about their lives and future plans. \n\nWhen he asked to come along, she said no because it was about self-discovery. That's a red flag for him since he didn't want her to go alone, especially given their history of trust issues. The argument led to him telling her to leave, which she did, and now he's being criticized as controlling.\n\nNow, considering their trust issues from past relationships, the girlfriend might have felt it was important to assert her independence. However, she didn't communicate this trip earlier, which is a big deal if they were supposed to be open. The author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme, but maybe he saw it as a way to protect the relationship's boundaries. \n\nBut wait, even though he pays for the apartment, that doesn't mean he can unilaterally decide where she can go. She has the right to her own autonomy, even if it's inconvenient. However, the lack of communication is on her side. She planned something significant without discussing it, which could be seen as a breach of trust, especially in a relationship where trust was a priority. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship was a reaction to her secrecy and the fact that she didn't consider his feelings. However, ending it by kicking her out might be seen as harsh. Maybe a discussion where they both express their feelings would have been better. But given their history, maybe the author felt it was necessary to set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish if she didn't consider the impact on their relationship. But she might have felt that self-discovery was important enough to prioritize. The key here is whether the lack of communication was intentional or not. If she planned it for months, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The author's reaction was extreme, but the root of the problem is the lack of communication and mutual consideration. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and personal boundaries. However, in many cases, ending a relationship over a solo trip without prior communication is debatable. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the breach of trust was significant, but his method of ending it could be questioned.\n"
