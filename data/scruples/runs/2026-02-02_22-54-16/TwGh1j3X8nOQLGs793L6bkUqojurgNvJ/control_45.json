Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him. The context is they've been in a 3-year relationship, he pays for the apartment, and they value trust a lot.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a solo trip and didn't inform him until just 5 days before leaving. She said she didn't tell him because he wouldn't have allowed it. The author's response was to kick her out of their home, which he pays for, and he offered money for a hotel, which she refused. He frames it as her not having the right to stay because she doesn't pay for the apartment. \n\nNow, considering the key points: Trust is a big part of their relationship. She didn't tell him about the trip for months and only mentioned it 5 days before leaving. That's a significant breach, especially in a relationship where trust is emphasized. However, the way he responded by kicking her out might be seen as harsh. Even though he pays for the apartment, they live together, so she might have expected some level of shared responsibility. \n\nHe argues that since she doesn't contribute to the rent, she has no right to stay. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, the dynamics can be more complex. The act of suddenly asking her to leave, even if she chose to stay with her parents, could be seen as abrupt. Also, the public backlash he received suggests that friends and family see it as controlling, which adds another layer. \n\nThe user's actions might be justified if he felt that her secrecy was a deal-breaker, especially given their history of trust issues. However, the method of ending the relationship by immediately evicting her from their home might be considered extreme. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing boundaries and future plans, could have been taken. \n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship had already been strained by her secret trip, the author might feel justified in ending things. The fact that she was planning a solo trip despite knowing his feelings about it adds to the complexity. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on how one views the balance between trust, communication, and the handling of the breakup. Some might see his actions as protecting himself from potential future issues, while others might think he overreacted.\n"
