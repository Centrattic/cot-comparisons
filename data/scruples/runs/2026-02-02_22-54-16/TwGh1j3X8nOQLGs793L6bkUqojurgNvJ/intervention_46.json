Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple has been together for three years. They live in an apartment paid for by the author. They value trust because both have been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo trip to South America, unannounced, and when the author asked to come, she said he wouldn't support her. The author then told her to leave, and she did, staying with her parents. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, trust, and living arrangements. The author mentions that they always told each other about their lives and future plans. The girlfriend planned the trip for months but didn't tell him until 5 days before departure. That seems like a big deal, especially since they live together. If she was going on a trip that would require her to be away for a significant amount of time, not discussing it with her partner seems like a breach of trust. They had a history of being open, so her secrecy is a problem.\n\nThen there's the living situation. The author pays for the apartment, and she doesn't. When he asked her to leave because she wasn't paying her share, she did. He offered money for a hotel, but she refused. That part seems a bit harsh, but maybe he felt justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe argument is about whether he was controlling by kicking her out. She wanted to go on a trip she had planned for months, but kept it secret. He might feel that her actions showed disrespect for their agreement about communication. On the other hand, some might argue that he could have handled it more maturely instead of immediately ending the relationship.\n\nBut considering the trust angle, which they emphasized, her not telling him about the trip could have broken that trust. His reaction might be extreme, but if he felt that her actions were a violation of their mutual trust, then his decision to end things might be seen as a response to her dishonesty.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were a justified response to her lack of communication. If the relationship was built on honesty and trust, her secrecy is a major issue. The author's decision to end it because she didn't contribute to the living expenses could be seen as standing up for his terms, even if the method was harsh. However, some might say that ending the relationship over this was too extreme, especially if there was potential to resolve the issue through discussion.\n\nBut given that they had a history of valuing trust and communication, the author's reaction might be seen as a consequence of her breaking that trust. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I need to consider if there's a middle ground where he could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions violated their agreed-upon trust and communication, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending the relationship. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
