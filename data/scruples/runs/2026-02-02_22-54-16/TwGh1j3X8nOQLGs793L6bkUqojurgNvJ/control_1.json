Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been in a 3-year relationship. The guy pays for the apartment by himself, which is a big point. They both value trust because they've been cheated on before. The girlfriend planned a solo backpacking trip across South America, which she hadn't told him about. She said he wouldn't have allowed her to go, which is probably true. When he confronts her, she argues she wants to live life fully, and he responds by telling her to leave the house. He offers money for a hotel, but she goes to her parents instead. Now he's wondering if he's an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, trust, and the living arrangement. She planned a trip for months without telling him. That's a big deal because they value trust and open communication. But then, when he finds out, he kicks her out of the apartment. The apartment is his, he pays for it. So legally, he can ask her to leave. But ethically?\n\nThe problem is that they live together in a two-bedroom apartment. Even though he pays for it, she's his partner. Maybe there was an unspoken agreement about living together. By kicking her out suddenly, he might have caused her to be homeless, even if he offered hotel money. Also, the way he handled it\u2014during an argument\u2014might be seen as harsh. He didn't give her a chance to resolve the situation, instead just told her to leave. That could be seen as controlling, even if he has the right to evict her.\n\nBut on the other hand, she kept a major life decision from him for months. That's a breach of trust. They both value trust, so her secrecy is a problem. He might feel that if she's not honest about something big like this, the relationship isn't working. However, instead of discussing it and maybe finding a compromise, he chose to end it abruptly. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk through the issue, address his feelings and her desire for independence.\n\nAlso, considering the living situation: if he's paying for the apartment, perhaps they had an understanding that she could stay there. Kicking her out without notice might be seen as unfair, even if he's the one paying. She might not have a place to go, and he did offer hotel money, but it's still sudden.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: if the main issue is her keeping a big secret, he's justified in feeling betrayed. But the way he ended it\u2014by evicting her during an argument\u2014might come across as harsh. He could be seen as in the right for wanting honesty, but wrong for handling it poorly. The question is whether his actions were proportionate to the issue.\n\nAnother angle: mutual respect. If they value trust, he should address her secrecy calmly. Kicking her out might be a reaction driven by hurt or anger rather than a considered decision. So maybe he's in the wrong for not giving her the chance to explain or for not being more understanding about her need for personal growth. But she's also wrong for not communicating.\n\nBut the user wants a yes or no answer. The options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering all that, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because he handled the situation poorly, possibly out of anger, and without giving her a chance to resolve it. Even though her secrecy is a problem, evicting her abruptly might be too extreme. So A might be the answer. But maybe B, because he has the right to his own home.\n"
