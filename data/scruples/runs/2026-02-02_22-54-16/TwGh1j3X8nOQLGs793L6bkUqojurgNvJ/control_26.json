Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple lived in a two-bedroom apartment that the guy paid for entirely. The girlfriend didn't pay rent but used a meter and compensated him for her usage. They both valued trust a lot because of past relationships. The girlfriend had planned a solo trip to South America and only told him days before. He didn't want her to go alone and ended up telling her to leave the house. She went to her parents' house, and he's getting backlash for being controlling.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the living arrangement and the communication. The guy pays for the apartment, and she's supposed to compensate him but doesn't pay directly. The trip was a surprise, which might have caused the argument. He felt she didn't respect his wishes by going alone, so he kicked her out. \n\nI need to consider if his actions were justified. Did she have a right to stay in the apartment he paid for? If she wasn't paying rent, maybe he had the right to ask her to leave. But they were in a committed relationship, so maybe there's an expectation of living together. However, she had been planning the trip for months but didn't inform him until last minute, which could be a breach of trust. They both valued trust, so maybe her not being upfront was an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, ending the relationship over this seems harsh. Even if she was wrong not to communicate, was his response proportionate? Kicking her out of the house might be seen as a controlling move, especially since she didn't have to pay rent. But he did offer to help with a hotel, which she refused. \n\nI'm conflicted. If they lived together, even if she didn't pay rent, maybe he shouldn't just kick her out. But if he's the sole financial provider and she's not contributing, he has some rights. However, the way he handled it\u2014using the living situation as leverage in the argument\u2014could be seen as manipulative. Also, the fact that he ended the relationship immediately after might be too abrupt. \n\nIn terms of trust, if she didn't tell him about the trip until last minute, that's a problem. But maybe she had reasons for keeping it a secret, like not wanting to argue. Still, in a relationship where trust is important, communication is key. \n\nI think the guy's actions might be a bit extreme. Even if she was wrong, ending the relationship by kicking her out in the heat of an argument isn't a mature solution. The fact that he used the apartment as a bargaining chip could be seen as using financial control. He might be in the wrong here. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
