Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, they've been in a 3-year relationship. He pays for the apartment by himself, and she compensates him. They both value trust a lot because of past cheating issues. The girlfriend planned a solo trip across South America and kept it a secret because she thought he wouldn't let her go. The author felt that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she shouldn't have the right to stay, so he told her to leave, which led to the breakup.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't inform him about the trip, even though they were big on trust. She thought he might object, so she hid it. The author felt that since he was the one paying for the home, she didn't have the right to demand to stay. When she left, he kicked her out, which seems harsh but maybe he felt it was necessary given the circumstances.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to end the relationship over her not telling him about a trip she was planning? They had trust issues, so her secrecy might have triggered his insecurities. However, maybe she considered it her personal freedom. The author's solution was to kick her out, which might be seen as extreme. Could there have been a better way to handle it without breaking up? Like discussing it and finding a compromise?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend going to her parents' house an hour away might not be the worst outcome, but the public backlash via calls to the author suggests some social pressure. The author is now questioning if he was an asshole.\n\nI think the key is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Ending the relationship because she didn't tell him about a trip could be seen as overreacting, especially if the trip was planned for months and she had her reasons. But given their history and the fact that she didn't communicate, maybe he had valid concerns about trust. However, kicking someone out of your home immediately after an argument, without trying to resolve it, might be seen as harsh. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle it with more communication and understanding. But then again, if trust was a cornerstone, her secrecy might have broken that trust. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A or B? I'm leaning towards A because breaking up over a trip without discussing might be too extreme, but others might see it as justified. Hmm.\n"
