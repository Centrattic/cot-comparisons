Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his ex-girlfriend lived in an apartment he paid for. She planned a solo backpacking trip, which he found out about five days before she left. He asked to join, but she said it was for self-discovery. He got angry and told her to leave, which she did, going to her parents' house. Now he's being called a controlling asshole and is unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The apartment is his, and she helps with the bill. They've been in a three-year relationship with a focus on trust. She wanted to do a solo trip, which he didn't agree with. He responded by kicking her out. The key points here are communication, trust, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author might argue that since he's the one paying for the apartment, he has the right to set boundaries. However, their relationship is supposed to be built on trust. By kicking her out over a disagreement about her travel plans, he might be seen as violating that trust. Also, she had been planning it for months, so maybe she thought she was within her rights to make her own decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that she didn't communicate properly, especially since it's a significant decision that affects their living situation. If she was going to be away, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. But she said she didn't tell him because he would disapprove. That's a red flag in communication. If she anticipated his disapproval, she should have tried to find a compromise instead of keeping it a secret.\n\nThe way he reacted by asking her to leave immediately could be seen as extreme. Giving her an ultimatum might not be the best approach. Maybe a better solution would have been to express his concerns and negotiate, like discussing financial support for a hotel instead of evicting her. His willingness to offer money for a hotel is a positive point, but the way he enforced it was confrontational.\n\nTrust is a big part of their relationship. If she felt she needed to go on a solo trip for self-discovery, and he's against it, that's a conflict in their values. However, using the living situation as leverage might not be fair. She's entitled to her personal growth, but he's also entitled to his feelings about her safety and their living arrangement. The balance here is tricky.\n\nIn terms of control, if he's the one paying for the apartment, he might feel more responsibility for their shared space. But relationships require mutual respect for individual autonomy. Kicking her out for wanting to travel, even if he's the one paying, could be seen as controlling. It might also be a power play rather than addressing the issue constructively.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author's response caused her to leave, and he received backlash. That suggests that others might view his reaction as harsh. However, if the relationship had underlying issues with communication and trust, this might be a breaking point for him.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid reasons for feeling upset and possibly miscommunication, the immediate action of evicting her without a more diplomatic approach could be seen as his fault. Relationships require negotiation and understanding. His reaction crossed a line from concern to control, making him at least partially responsible. So the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
