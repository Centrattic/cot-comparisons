Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she went on a solo backpacking trip without telling him.\n\nFirst, context is important. They lived together in an apartment the author paid for. The girlfriend planned a solo trip, which he found out about only five days before she left. He was concerned about her going alone, especially given their history of trust issues. When she refused to let him come along, he decided to kick her out of the house, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, looking at the key points. The author mentions that trust was a big part of their relationship, and both had been cheated on before. The girlfriend's trip was unannounced and solo, which he didn't agree with. He offered financial help for a hotel, but she refused. He felt that since she didn't pay for the apartment, she didn't have the right to demand to stay.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the argument here is whether his reaction was justified. He gave her an ultimatum: either she leaves or they split. She chose to leave. But was kicking her out the right move? Relationships require communication and mutual respect. The fact that she had been planning this for months but didn't tell him could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the way he handled it\u2014threatening to make her leave\u2014might come off as extreme. Even though he pays for the apartment, relationships are about negotiation, not control. His actions could be seen as controlling, even if his intention was to protect the trust they had. Also, the suddenness of the decision and the impact on their relationship might be problematic. So, while the girlfriend's secrecy was an issue, the author's response might have been too harsh. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014Yes, he is in the wrong because his reaction was controlling, even if there were valid concerns.\n"
