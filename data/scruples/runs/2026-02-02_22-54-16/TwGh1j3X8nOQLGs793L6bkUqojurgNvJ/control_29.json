Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend planning a solo backpacking trip without telling her partner, who then dumps her because she didn't pay for the apartment they shared.\n\nFirst, the apartment context is important. The author pays for the apartment entirely, and the girlfriend compensates him for her share through a meter. So she's not financially responsible for the rent. The author mentions that he wanted to make sure she could afford other things like gifts and trips. But here, she planned a solo trip that the author wasn't okay with. He felt betrayed and kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment, so he considered her not having the right to stay. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are communication, mutual trust, and the dynamics of their living arrangement. The girlfriend planned a trip for months without informing him, which the author clearly didn't want. The author's response was to kick her out, but since she wasn't paying rent, maybe he had the right to do that. However, their relationship was based on trust, and perhaps the author's reaction was too harsh. Dumping someone over a disagreement about a trip, even if they didn't pay rent, might be seen as extreme.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's parents called him an asshole, which is a red flag. Maybe the author acted impulsively during an argument. The fact that he offered hotel money but she refused might show he was trying to be reasonable, but the immediate kickout might have been too sudden. In relationships, communication is key. If they couldn't resolve the issue, maybe breaking up was the result of existing problems. However, the decision to end the relationship over this specific incident could be debatable. It's possible that the author was within his rights regarding the apartment, but the way he handled it could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, the girlfriend's secrecy might have been the real issue. \n\nI need to balance both perspectives. The author had a valid point about the apartment, but the way he ended the relationship might be too abrupt. Maybe he had the right to ask her to leave since she wasn't paying rent, but the situation's context (long-term relationship, trust issues) complicates it. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations in relationships. In some views, the author is justified, but others might see his reaction as extreme. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the apartment ownership and the immediate consequences, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the emotional response and the method might be questionable. Hmm.\n"
