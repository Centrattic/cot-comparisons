Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. The context is that they've been together for three years, he pays for the apartment, they value trust because they've both been cheated on before. She planned a solo trip that she wanted to take, he didn't want her to go alone, and when she did, he kicked her out. Now people are calling him a controlling asshole, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: he's the one paying for the apartment, he didn't want her to go on a solo trip, she didn't tell him until 5 days before, and he felt like he had to set a boundary because she wasn't part of his financial responsibility. He offered her a hotel for a week, but she refused. Then he told her to leave the apartment, saying if she wants to live life to the fullest, she can leave. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: she might have felt she needed her space, and she had planned it for months. She might have felt that the author was being controlling, not respecting her autonomy. The author's response of kicking her out might be seen as extreme, especially since they were in a three-year relationship. The fact that he was the one paying for the apartment adds complexity here.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Trust is important in their relationship, and the author mentions they were open about future plans. However, she didn't inform him about the trip until last minute. That could be a breach of trust from the author's point of view. But why did she wait until 5 days before? Maybe she felt conflicted, or thought he would disapprove. But not communicating major life decisions is a problem. \n\nThe author's reaction: instead of discussing it and maybe finding a compromise, he said she could leave the apartment. That's a major consequence. Kicking someone out of a shared home is a serious action. Even if he's the one paying, in a relationship, people often expect to make big decisions together. So, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nAlso, the author's reason for kicking her out was because she didn't pay for the apartment, so she didn't have a right to stay. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, even if one partner pays more, they might still expect to live together. The act of kicking her out could be seen as using financial responsibility as leverage in a relationship conflict, which is not healthy. \n\nThe author might have felt justified, but relationships require communication and compromise. Instead of giving her an ultimatum, maybe a more constructive approach would have been better. The fact that she went to her parents and he got called controlling suggests that others see his action as too harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might have valid feelings about trust and sudden decisions, but the way he handled it was extreme. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong, because the response was disproportionate. The situation could have been resolved with a conversation instead of ending the relationship and kicking her out. \n\nBut then again, if the trust was important to them, and the girlfriend didn't communicate the trip, maybe the author felt it was a deal-breaker. However, the method of breaking it off by kicking her out might be seen as overly controlling. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the action was too extreme, even if the issue existed."
