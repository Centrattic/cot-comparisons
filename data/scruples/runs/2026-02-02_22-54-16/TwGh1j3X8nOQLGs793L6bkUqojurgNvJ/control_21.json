Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for ending their 3-year relationship after their girlfriend went on an unannounced solo backpacking trip. They provided context about living in an apartment they pay for, sharing trust, and planning trips together. The key points here are communication, mutual trust, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a solo trip for months without telling him. He mentioned they value trust a lot, especially because both have been cheated on before. Not informing each other about major plans could break that trust. But the user's reaction was to kick her out and end the relationship. Is that justified?\n\nHe argues that since he pays for the apartment, she doesn't have the right to stay if he doesn't want her there. But she was going to be away for a significant amount of time (starting Friday, so maybe a week or more?), and he offered a hotel for a week, which she refused. However, the main issue is whether the decision to end the relationship was too harsh. \n\nThe user feels they put their foot down because they were upset she didn't communicate. The girlfriend wanted to go on a solo trip to \"discover herself,\" which she thought he wouldn't allow. The user's response was to tell her to leave the house. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If both value trust and transparency, then not discussing such a major trip is a problem. But ending the relationship over a disagreement might be extreme. Maybe there could have been a discussion about the trip, setting boundaries, or finding a compromise. Kicking her out immediately might come off as controlling, as the girlfriend's family criticized him. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was willing to help financially (hotel money) shows he was trying to support her, but she refused. Perhaps the user's anger led them to overreact. The girlfriend's action of not communicating was wrong, but the user's response might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the user might be in the wrong for handling it so abruptly. The right approach could have been discussing the situation, expressing his feelings about the lack of communication, and then making a decision together. Ending the relationship because of a solo trip, especially after a fight, could be viewed as an overreaction. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
