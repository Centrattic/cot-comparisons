Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be \u201cdiscovering herself\u201d on this trip, and when I asked why hadn\u2019t she told me she said because I wouldn\u2019t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: \u201cwhy can\u2019t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyou can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out\u201d\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn\u2019t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn\u2019t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she went on an unannounced backpacking trip. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together for three years, living in an apartment the guy pays for. She wanted to go on a solo trip across South America, planned for months, but didn't tell him until 5 days before leaving. He didn't want her to go alone, they argued, and he told her to leave his place, which she did. Now he's questioning if he was right.\n\nSo, key points: They had trust issues from past relationships. He pays for the apartment, and she compensates him. She wanted to travel solo, which he didn't agree with. He kicked her out, she left to her parents. People are calling him a controlling asshole. \n\nThe question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the dynamics. In a relationship, both partners should have autonomy. She had the right to plan her own trip, even if it was solo. But he might feel it's a big decision that affects their relationship. But he didn't give her a chance to explain or negotiate. Instead, he kicked her out because she didn't pay for the apartment. But that's not a valid reason. If she's living in his apartment and he's the one paying, but they're in a relationship, then he's being controlling by using that as leverage. Also, if she's leaving on a trip, maybe he's upset because she's going to be away, but he didn't give her the option to stay. \n\nWait, he offered to pay for a hotel for her for a week, but she refused. But maybe she didn't need it. Also, he's using the fact that she doesn't pay rent as an excuse to kick her out. That seems harsh. In a relationship, you don't just kick someone out over a disagreement. Even if they don't contribute to rent, that's a financial arrangement, not a reason for breaking up. Also, if she went to her parents, maybe she left on her own. But the way he phrased it, he told her to leave, which is a bit of a power move.\n\nBut then again, if he's paying for the apartment, he has the right to ask someone to leave. But in a committed relationship, that's a big step. Normally, couples don't just kick each other out over disagreements. Unless there's some major issue like abuse or illegal activity, which isn't the case here. So, his action of dumping her and kicking her out seems extreme. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was upset about her traveling solo is a personal issue. He might feel it's unsafe or against their plans. But she had a right to her own autonomy and travel. He should have discussed it and maybe come to a mutual decision, not just use the apartment as leverage. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were controlling and extreme. Even if he was hurt or felt disrespected by her not telling him, kicking her out because she didn't pay rent isn't a valid reason for breaking up. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
