      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who eats leftovers from other people's tables in restaurants is in the wrong. They mentioned their girlfriend and others are upset, and they're defending their actions by saying it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, taking someone else's food is generally seen as impolite or even theft. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission might violate social etiquette. People might feel uncomfortable or offended because it's an invasion of their property, even temporarily.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The original diners didn't give permission for others to take their leftovers, so it's a breach of their autonomy. Even if the leftovers are left unattended, taking them isn't the same as finding discarded items in a public trash can. The setting of a table is more personal, so taking from there could be more intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author is being insensitive by dismissing others' feelings. Saying it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior ignores the social context and the discomfort it causes others. It's important to consider how your actions affect those around you, especially in a shared space like a restaurant.\n\nHowever, there's an argument about reducing waste. But that doesn't necessarily justify taking others' property. Many restaurants have their own policies about leftovers, and maybe they have ways to handle waste without customers taking them. The author's actions might also set a bad example or make others feel unsafe.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, while it's not a criminal act, it's against social norms and restaurant policies. Restaurants might have rules against this, and staff might ask customers to stop if they see it happening. The key here is the social acceptability and the impact on others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting inconsiderately by taking others' leftovers without permission, causing distress to their companions, and not respecting social norms. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
