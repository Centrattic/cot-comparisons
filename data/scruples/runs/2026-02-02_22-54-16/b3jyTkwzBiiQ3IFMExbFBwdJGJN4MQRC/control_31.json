      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing. They argue it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most cultures, eating someone else's leftovers without permission is considered rude. Even if the table is empty, the food was left behind by previous customers, and taking it could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Restaurants might have policies about this, but even if not, societal expectations often dictate that you don't touch others' belongings, even if they're abandoned.\n\nThe person's justification is that the food would go to waste. While reducing waste is a good intention, the method here is questionable. It's not the restaurant's food; it belongs to the previous customers. The restaurant's responsibility is to serve their own customers, not to redistribute leftovers from others. The customers, not the restaurant, are the ones who ordered and paid for the food. Taking leftovers without their consent might be against the restaurant's terms of service, but even if not, it's a social etiquette issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassed and finding it disgusting. That's a valid emotional response. Personal choices in public places can affect others, and if someone's actions make their companion uncomfortable, especially in a relationship, there's a social expectation to consider others' feelings. The author's insistence on their right to do it despite others' discomfort shows a lack of consideration for their partner's perspective.\n\nAlso, the argument of \"it's my choice\" doesn't hold much weight in public social settings where others are present. Actions that impact others, even if done in public, often require a balance between personal freedom and social harmony. The author's behavior might not be illegal, but it's definitely inconsiderate and could be seen as violating the unspoken rules of dining etiquette.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting inconsiderately by not respecting the social norms and their partner's feelings. Their justification about waste is noble but doesn't override the social expectations and the impact on others. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
