      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. Their company, especially their girlfriend, is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. When people leave food at a restaurant, it's usually their own choice to not finish it, maybe intentionally or not. Taking that food could be seen as intrusive. Even if the food would go to waste, it's not necessarily the person's responsibility to decide that. There might be policies in place by the restaurant about leftover food, but even if not, taking someone else's leftovers without permission could be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nThe girlfriend and others in their group are upset because the person's actions are embarrassing and they find it disgusting. The author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. But in social settings, there are shared norms. Even if it's their choice, acting in a way that others find offensive can affect group dynamics. The author might be overstepping by not respecting the group's discomfort, even if they see it as their personal choice.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent. The people who left the food didn't give permission for others to take it. Even if the food is left behind, it's still their property. Taking it without asking could be seen as stealing or at least very impolite. The author might not realize how their actions are perceived by others, which could be a sign of insensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. They're disregarding social etiquette and the feelings of those around them, even if their intention is to prevent waste. The correct answer would be A.\n"
