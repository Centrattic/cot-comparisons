      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at a restaurant. The author does this when the people leave, and their girlfriend and friends get upset, saying it's disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends it by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, eating someone else's leftover food at a restaurant is considered impolite. It's a violation of personal space and boundaries. Even though the food might be thrown away, taking it without permission is seen as intrusive. The act of taking someone's belongings, even leftovers, without consent is generally frowned upon.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But social behavior often involves considering others' feelings and societal expectations. While the author might not be breaking any laws, they are likely violating social etiquette. The girlfriend's reaction is about discomfort and respect for others' property and privacy.\n\nAlso, the restaurant might have policies against this. Some places might consider it theft if they charge for leftovers or if the food is meant to be disposed of properly. Even if not, the act could be seen as unhygienic or inappropriate by others, leading to embarrassment.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention is to reduce waste, the method of doing so by taking without permission is problematic. There are better ways to handle leftovers, like asking the restaurant or using composting programs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions are socially unacceptable and disrespectful to others' personal space and property.\n"
