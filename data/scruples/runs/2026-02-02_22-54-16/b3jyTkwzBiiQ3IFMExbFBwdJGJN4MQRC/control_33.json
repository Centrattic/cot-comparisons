      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about eating other people's leftovers in a restaurant. The user is asking if that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider restaurant policies. Most places probably have rules about not taking food from other tables. When someone orders, the food is theirs, and the restaurant might have agreements with suppliers or waste management systems. Taking leftovers could interfere with that. Also, health codes might be a concern. If someone left their food, it's not safe to assume it's okay to take it, especially since the restaurant might handle leftover food in specific ways.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentions that their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing. Social norms usually dictate that people should only eat what they've ordered. Taking from others could be seen as intrusive or rude. Even if the food is going to waste, there are proper ways to handle that, like asking the server what the restaurant does with leftovers. \n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but in a public place like a restaurant, actions can affect others. The people at the table might have left for a reason, maybe they're done, or they left some food on purpose. Taking it without permission could be seen as violating their privacy or boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's behavior might lead to discomfort for their companions. If the girlfriend is upset, it's a relationship issue. The author's insistence on doing it despite others' feelings could be inconsiderate. Even if the author believes it's their choice, respecting others' feelings and the restaurant's rules is important.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're violating social norms, possibly restaurant policies, and not considering the feelings of their companions. The answer should be A.\n"
