      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author admits to eating leftovers from other tables when those people leave. Their companions, especially the girlfriend, are upset and embarrassed by this behavior. The author feels it's their choice and resists being controlled.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, eating someone else's leftovers without permission is generally considered rude. Even if the food might otherwise be thrown away, taking it without asking could be seen as violating personal space and boundaries. People might have specific reasons for not finishing their food, like dietary restrictions or allergies. Eating their leftovers could pose a risk if they can't eat certain ingredients.\n\nAlso, the author's response to their girlfriend's disapproval by asserting it's their choice suggests a lack of consideration for others' feelings. While everyone has the right to make choices, those choices should respect others' comfort and safety. The girlfriend's reaction is about both social embarrassment and potential health risks.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument about reducing food waste. If the food is going to be discarded, using it might be seen as responsible. However, the method of doing so is questionable without checking with the restaurant or the people involved.\n\nIn most social contexts, respecting others' belongings and personal space is key. Eating someone else's food without permission is a breach of that respect. The author's behavior, while possibly motivated by a desire to avoid waste, is likely causing discomfort and embarrassment to their companions, which is a valid concern.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions cross social boundaries and could have negative consequences, even if the intent is to reduce waste. The right approach would be to either wait for the staff to clear the plates or, if allowed by the restaurant, ask for the leftovers to take home, rather than taking them without permission.\n"
