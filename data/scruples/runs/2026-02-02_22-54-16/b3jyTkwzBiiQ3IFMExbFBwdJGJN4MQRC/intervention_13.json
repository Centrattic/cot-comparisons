The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author's friends, especially the girlfriend, are upset about it. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In many cultures, eating someone else's leftovers is considered impolite. It might make others uncomfortable because they feel their personal space or belongings are invaded. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without asking could be seen as intrusive.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The people left the table, but taking their food without their permission might violate their property rights, even temporarily. While the food is going to be discarded, the act of taking it without asking might be seen as a breach of etiquette.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but in social settings, there are unspoken rules. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the behavior is causing embarrassment and conflict. The author's insistence on their right to do so might be seen as disregarding others' feelings, even if the intention is to avoid waste.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument about reducing food waste. However, the method of doing so by taking others' leftovers without consent might not be the most appropriate. There are other ways to handle food waste, like donating or proper disposal by the restaurant staff.\n\nSo, considering social etiquette, consent, and the impact on others, the author's actions are likely inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the behavior is causing discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
