      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author justifies this by saying the food would otherwise go to waste, but their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. In most public places, eating someone else's leftovers is generally considered inappropriate. People have a right to privacy regarding their belongings, even if they're not in use anymore. But the argument is that it's going to waste. However, restaurants often have policies about leftover food. Maybe some places donate leftovers, but the author is taking it directly, which could interfere with the restaurant's processes. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The people who left the food didn't give permission for others to take it. Even if it's leftovers, taking without permission could be seen as theft. Also, there's the aspect of personal space and boundaries. Others might find it uncomfortable, which is why the girlfriend is upset. The author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them doesn't hold up if others are directly affected by their actions. \n\nPublic behavior affects those around you. Even if the author isn't stealing in a legal sense, the act could be seen as inconsiderate. The emotional impact on companions is significant here. The girlfriend's discomfort and anger suggest that the action is affecting their relationship. \n\nSo, while the intention is to reduce waste, the method is problematic. There are better ways to address food waste, like supporting restaurants that donate leftovers or using food rescue apps. Therefore, the author is acting insensitively and violating social norms, making them at fault.\n"
