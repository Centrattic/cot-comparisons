      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The user is asking for a judgment, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they do this to prevent food from going to waste. That's a valid point because food waste is a real issue. However, the main issue here is taking someone else's food without permission. Even if the people left the table, the food still belongs to them until they leave it behind. Once they leave, maybe it's considered abandoned, but that's debatable.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's actions are making their girlfriend and others uncomfortable. They're called disgusting and embarrassing, which suggests that this behavior is socially unacceptable in their circle. The author is defending their choice by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But respecting others' property and social norms is important in public places.\n\nRestaurants might have policies about this. Some might allow it once a table is cleared, but others might not. The author isn't considering the restaurant's rules, which could be another angle. Also, even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as theft, depending on local laws. In some places, abandoned food isn't yours to take; it's still the restaurant's property until they decide to discard it.\n\nThe moral aspect: is it right to take something that isn't yours, even with good intentions? The author's intention is to reduce waste, which is noble, but the method might be unethical. The people at the next table might have wanted to take the food home, or maybe they left it by accident. Taking it without knowing could be causing harm they aren't aware of.\n\nAlso, the author is dismissing others' feelings about it. Saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them is a bit dismissive of others' comfort. Social interactions often require considering how others feel, even if you believe your actions are justified.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author is taking someone else's property without permission, which is generally considered wrong. Even if the intention is to prevent waste, the method is problematic. The social discomfort and potential legal or ethical issues make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
