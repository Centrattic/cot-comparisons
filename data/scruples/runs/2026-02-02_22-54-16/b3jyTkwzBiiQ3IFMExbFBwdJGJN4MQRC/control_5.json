      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author goes to a restaurant and when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers. Their girlfriend and others are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether eating others' leftovers is wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nPublic dining etiquette usually involves not touching other people's food. Even if the food is left behind, taking it might be seen as intrusive or inappropriate. The restaurant's policy might handle leftovers, maybe they have a way to donate or dispose of them. The author's action could be considered disrespectful to the previous customers, even if they left. People might have specific reasons for not finishing their meals, like dietary issues or allergies, and taking the food could be problematic if not properly handled.\n\nSocial norms play a role here. In many cultures, it's considered rude to take someone else's food, regardless of whether it's left over. The fact that the author's partner is upset suggests that this behavior is socially frowned upon in their circles. The author's argument that it's their choice might not hold when considering shared social spaces and respecting others' belongings, even if those people aren't present anymore.\n\nAlso, the author is being insensitive to others' feelings. Even if they don't see the problem, causing embarrassment or discomfort to their girlfriend and friends is a valid concern. The author's insistence on autonomy in this situation might overlook the communal aspect of public spaces and the unspoken rules that guide behavior there.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is violating social norms and causing distress to others. Therefore, they are likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
