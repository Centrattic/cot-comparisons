The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who eats leftovers from other tables at restaurants is in the wrong. They mentioned that their girlfriend and others get mad, but they feel it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical angle. Eating someone else's leftovers could be seen as taking without permission, which is generally frowned upon. Even if the food is going to waste, it's someone else's property until they leave. Taking it without asking might make others uncomfortable, especially if they notice.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. In many cultures, there's an unspoken rule of personal space and property. Taking someone's leftover food could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. The author's actions might be considered rude or inconsiderate, even if the intention is to avoid waste.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but in social settings, actions often affect others. The girlfriend's reaction is about being embarrassed, which is a valid social concern. The author's behavior could cause discomfort to others at the table, not just their companions.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument for not being in the wrong is that the food is wasted otherwise. However, the right to take someone else's unused food isn't clearly established. Restaurants might have policies against this, and staff might not appreciate it either.\n\nSo, weighing these points: respecting others' property and social norms versus reducing waste. The consensus in most societies probably leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the social and ethical implications, even if the intention is good.\n"
