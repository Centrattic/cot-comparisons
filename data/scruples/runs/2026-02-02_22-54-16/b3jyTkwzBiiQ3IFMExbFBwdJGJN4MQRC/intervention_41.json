      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's friends and girlfriend are upset about it, but the author thinks it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's considered rude to take someone else's food, even if they left it. People might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they're done, maybe they're not, but taking it without permission could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Even if the food would go to waste, the act of taking it without asking the people who were eating it could be problematic. The people who left might have wanted to finish it later, or maybe they just weren't done. \n\nAlso, the author's companions are upset, which suggests that it's causing discomfort. Social interactions often require considering others' feelings, even if the action itself isn't illegal. The author's argument is about personal choice, but in social settings, actions can affect others. So even if the author isn't breaking any rules, the social acceptability is in question. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that reducing waste is good, but the method here is questionable. The right approach might involve asking if the food is okay to take, but since the people left, that's not possible. So the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the action disregards social etiquette and others' possible feelings, even if the intent is to prevent waste.\n"
