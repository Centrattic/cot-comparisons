      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author's friends and girlfriend find it disgusting and embarrassing, but the author defends it as their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most cultures, eating someone else's food without permission is generally considered impolite. People usually expect their food to be their own, and taking leftovers from others could be seen as intrusive or disrespectful. Even if the food is going to waste, the act of taking it without asking might cross a social boundary.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The people who left the food didn't give permission for others to take it. While the author's intention is to reduce waste, the lack of consent is a key issue here. Others might feel that their property (even if temporary) is being taken without their agreement.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice. However, in social settings, actions that affect others carry responsibility. Even if it's a personal choice, the impact on those around them matters. The girlfriend's discomfort suggests that this behavior affects the group dynamic negatively. Insensitivity could be a factor here, as the author isn't considering the feelings of those accompanying them.\n\nLegally, there's probably no issue with taking leftover food from an abandoned table, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The main conflict is between the author's desire to prevent waste and the social norms that prioritize consent and respect for others' belongings.\n\nSo, while the author's intention is good, the action itself is likely inconsiderate and breaches social etiquette. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're disregarding the feelings and expectations of others in the situation.\n"
