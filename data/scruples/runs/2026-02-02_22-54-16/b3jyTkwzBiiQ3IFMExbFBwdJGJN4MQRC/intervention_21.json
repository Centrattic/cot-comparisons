      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who eats other people's leftovers in restaurants is in the wrong. The question is framed as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The author's argument is that they're just saving food from being thrown away, but their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they might see it as reducing food waste, which is a valid environmental concern. However, there's also the issue of social norms and respect for others' property. Even if the food is left behind, taking it without permission could be seen as intrusive or inconsiderate. \n\nRestaurants typically don't allow this practice because it can lead to hygiene issues or customer discomfort. Also, people might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they\u2019re done, maybe they\u2019re waiting for the bill, or they might come back later. Taking it without asking could be a breach of trust in the establishment's policies.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is about social embarrassment and finding it disgusting. Public behavior that others find off-putting can strain relationships and violate social etiquette. Even if the author's intention is noble, the impact on those around them matters. The author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior might not hold because actions in public spaces can affect others, and there's an expectation of mutual respect.\n\nSo, balancing the intention to reduce waste against social norms and potential disrespect to others' property and feelings, the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, they could be in the wrong.\n"
