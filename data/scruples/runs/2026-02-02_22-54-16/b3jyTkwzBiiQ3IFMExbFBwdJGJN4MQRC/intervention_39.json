      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they eat leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants when those people leave. Their girlfriend and others in their company find this disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their actions by saying it's their choice and that others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. When people go to a restaurant, they generally expect their food and belongings to be respected. If someone leaves their food behind, it's usually considered their property until they leave. Taking it without permission might be seen as stealing, even if the food is going to be thrown away. Restaurants might have their own policies about leftovers, but that's not specified here.\n\nAnother angle is the perspective of others at the table. The author's girlfriend is upset, which suggests that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationship. The author's justification is that they're being wasteful, but others might see it as inconsiderate. Public displays of this behavior could make others uncomfortable or embarrassed, which their girlfriend is expressing.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent. The other people didn't give permission for their leftovers to be taken. Even if the food would be discarded, the act of taking it without asking could be seen as violating personal boundaries. People might have different reasons for leaving food, like dietary restrictions or just not finishing a meal, and taking it assumes they want it gone, which isn't always the case.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. However, in shared spaces like restaurants, there's an implicit agreement to respect others and maintain a respectful environment. The author's actions might be seen as crossing that line, even if they don't see it as their problem. The emotional impact on their girlfriend and others is significant, so ignoring their feelings could be insensitive.\n\nI should also consider cultural differences. In some places, sharing food or taking leftovers might be more accepted, but in many Western contexts, personal space and property are highly valued. The author's behavior might clash with those norms, leading to the reactions they're getting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned in reducing waste, are likely violating social norms and causing distress to those around them. The fact that their girlfriend is getting mad and feeling embarrassed indicates that this is a problem beyond just the author's personal choice. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
