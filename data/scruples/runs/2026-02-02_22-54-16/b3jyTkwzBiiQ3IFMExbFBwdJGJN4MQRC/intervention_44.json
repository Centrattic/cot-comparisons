      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about them eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants when those people leave. Their girlfriend and others in their company are upset, but the author thinks it's their choice and the others shouldn't control their behavior. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms here. Taking someone else's food without permission, even if it's leftovers, can be seen as a violation of personal space and property. Restaurants might have their own policies, but even if they don't, it's about the perception of others and the social etiquette involved. \n\nOn one hand, the author's reasoning is that the food would go to waste, so they're being resourceful. There's a valid point about reducing waste, but it's not the customer's responsibility to handle that. Restaurants handle food waste, and perhaps they have protocols. Taking someone else's leftovers could be considered rude or intrusive because it's not their food. \n\nThen there's the aspect of people's reactions. The girlfriend is upset, so even if the author doesn't see it as a big deal, others might. The question is about whether the author's actions are insensitive. The author's response of saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them could be seen as dismissive of others' feelings, which might be part of the problem. \n\nAlso, the social norm is that you don't take food from someone else's table without asking. It's a boundary that people expect to be respected. Even if the table is empty, the food was intended for those people, and taking it could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, while the author's intention to prevent waste is understandable, the action itself is likely considered rude or inconsiderate. The fact that others are upset and the author brushes off their concerns as \"control\" might indicate that the author is in the wrong. They might not be respecting social norms and are not considering the feelings of those around them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because taking others' leftovers without permission is generally considered inappropriate, and dismissing others' concerns adds to the issue.\n"
