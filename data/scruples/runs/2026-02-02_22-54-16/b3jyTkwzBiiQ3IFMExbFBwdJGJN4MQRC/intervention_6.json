The people in my company (especially my girlfriend) say I'm disgusting and embarrassing, and they usually get pretty mad at me. Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers in restaurants. The author's girlfriend and others are upset, but the author thinks it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, taking someone else's food without permission might be seen as stealing, even if they left the table. But on the other hand, the food would be thrown away, so maybe reducing waste is a good intention.\n\nWait, but does the author have permission? If the people left, they might not want others to take their food. It's possible they might have wanted to finish it themselves or take it home. So taking it without asking could be considered impolite or even theft, depending on the restaurant's policies. Some places might have a policy to leave food for staff to take home, or maybe it's against their rules.\n\nAlso, the social aspect: even if the author is not breaking any laws, they might be violating social norms. The girlfriend's reaction is about being disgusted and embarrassed. So even if the author isn't \"wrong\" legally, socially, they might be inconsiderate. The author's argument is that it's their choice, but others might see it as disregard for others' property and feelings.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the restaurant has a system for handling leftovers. If the staff is aware and okay with it, then it's different. But if the author is taking it without permission, that's another issue. If it's a private table, the food is meant for the people sitting there, and taking it without their consent is a problem.\n\nSo, even if the intention is good (reducing waste), the action is without consent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're taking something that doesn't belong to them, even if it's about to be thrown away. The key points are consent and respecting others' property. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
