Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The person justifies it by saying the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and friends are upset.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the social norms here. In many places, taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is generally considered rude or inappropriate. People might find it intrusive or a violation of personal space, even if the table is unoccupied. The main issue here is about respecting boundaries and the expectations of others.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but they're in a social setting where others might not agree. The girlfriend is upset, which could affect their relationship. Even if the food is being wasted, there's a difference between reducing waste and taking it without asking. Maybe they could have a more appropriate way, like offering to take the leftovers if the other party leaves them, but just taking them seems off.\n\nAlso, the act of eating someone else's food might be seen as greedy or inconsiderate. The people at the table might not want their leftovers touched, even if they're leaving. So the author's actions could be perceived as insensitive, even if their intention is to prevent waste.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the intention matters, but the perception and social norms are also important. So while the author thinks they're being helpful, others might see it as a negative action. The girlfriend's reaction is about the author's behavior affecting them and others, which is a relationship issue. The author might need to consider their partner's feelings here, even if they don't see the problem themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because their actions are violating social norms and hurting their partner's feelings, even if the intention is to reduce waste. The key is balancing personal choice with the impact on others in social interactions.\n"
