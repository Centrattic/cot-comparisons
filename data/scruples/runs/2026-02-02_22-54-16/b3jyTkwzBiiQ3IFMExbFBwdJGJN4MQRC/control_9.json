      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftover food at restaurants. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person takes leftovers from nearby tables when those people leave. Their partner and friends are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The person argues it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: Is taking leftovers from others acceptable? Does the person have the right to do so? Are they being insensitive?\n\nRestaurants typically have policies about leftover food. Usually, once a party leaves, the staff might handle the leftovers, maybe throw them out. But taking someone else's food could be seen as theft or at least very rude. Even if the food would be thrown away, taking it without permission isn't the customer's decision. The restaurant's staff manages that. \n\nAlso, from a social standpoint, eating someone else's leftovers is considered impolite. People might find it creepy or invasive. The fact that the person's girlfriend and friends are upset suggests that there's a social norm against this behavior. The person's justification that it's their choice ignores the impact on others around them. Insensitivity here is about not respecting others' feelings and the social norms of public spaces.\n\nThe person's argument that others shouldn't control their behavior isn't valid because public actions affect others. Even if it's their choice, acting in a way that others find offensive could make it wrong. So, the person is in the wrong because they're violating social norms and possibly restaurant policies, causing discomfort to others.\n"
