      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's friends, especially his girlfriend, are upset and call him disgusting. He's defending himself by saying it's his choice and they shouldn't control his behavior.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, the leftovers are still the property of the people who ordered them until they leave. Once the people leave, the restaurant might have policies about handling leftover food, but taking it without permission could be an issue. Some places might donate leftovers, so maybe the author's actions are interfering with that process.\n\nSocially, even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it might be seen as impolite or inconsiderate. The people who left might not want their leftovers eaten by strangers. Also, the author's behavior makes his girlfriend and friends uncomfortable, which affects their shared experience. Insensitivity here could be about respecting others' boundaries and feelings.\n\nThe author argues it's his choice, but when actions directly impact others' comfort and respect, there's a social responsibility to consider. The key points are legality, restaurant policies, social norms, and the impact on those around him. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his actions are legally or socially acceptable. Even if he's not breaking the law, social norms often dictate appropriate behavior in public spaces. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's disregarding others' feelings and potentially violating restaurant protocols.\n"
