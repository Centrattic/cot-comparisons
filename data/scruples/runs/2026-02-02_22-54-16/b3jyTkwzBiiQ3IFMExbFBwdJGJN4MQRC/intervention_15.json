      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. They want a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author goes to a restaurant or cafe and when people at nearby tables leave, they take the leftovers. The girlfriend and others in their company find this disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nSo, I should consider a few angles. Legally, in most places, once the customer leaves, the food is considered abandoned and the restaurant can do with it as they wish. The author might be taking it before staff clean up, so maybe it's not illegal. But socially, is it acceptable? Even if it's not illegal, social norms might frown upon it. The author's actions could be seen as intrusive or violating personal space. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it's socially unacceptable in their circle. The author is dismissing their concerns by saying it's a personal choice, but public behavior often has societal expectations. Even if the author isn't breaking a law, they might be violating social etiquette, which could make them at fault in terms of relationships and social conduct. Also, the justification that it's going to waste is a utilitarian argument, but it's not about the author's permission to take it, just the waste. The key points are legality, social norms, and the impact on others. Legally maybe not wrong, but socially, they are causing discomfort to their companions. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if not illegal, it's socially unacceptable and affecting others' feelings. The author's argument about personal choice doesn't account for the social setting and others' perspectives.\n"
