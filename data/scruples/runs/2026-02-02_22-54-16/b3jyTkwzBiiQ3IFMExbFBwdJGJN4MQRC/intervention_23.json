      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. Their friends and girlfriend are upset, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The person argues it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, using someone else's leftovers without permission is seen as inappropriate. Even if the food is being thrown away, taking it without asking might be considered rude. Restaurants might have policies against this, and staff might not appreciate it either.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal boundaries. The person's actions are affecting others around them, especially their partner. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this behavior is causing discomfort and conflict. The author's justification of \"it's my choice\" might not account for the social context where such actions are expected to respect others' space and belongings.\n\nAlso, the reasoning that the food would go to waste isn't a strong defense. Even if the food is discarded, taking it without permission can be seen as violating the implicit social contract of not interfering with others' property, even if they're not using it anymore. Waste is a separate issue that the restaurant or their own conscience might address, but it doesn't justify taking from others.\n\nThe author's insistence on their autonomy (\"my choice\") clashes with the social expectations of respecting others in public spaces. While everyone has the right to make their own choices, those choices must consider the impact on others and societal norms. So, even if the action isn't illegal, it's likely socially unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions are insensitive and inconsiderate, making them at least partially in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
