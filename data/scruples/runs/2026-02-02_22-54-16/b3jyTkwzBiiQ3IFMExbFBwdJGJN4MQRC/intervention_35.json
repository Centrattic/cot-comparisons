Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for eating others' leftovers at restaurants. The writer's friends and girlfriend are upset, but they argue it's their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects here. Taking someone else's food without their permission could be seen as respecting the restaurant's policies or not. Some places might have rules about not taking leftovers, even if the other party leaves. Also, there's the issue of consent. The people who left the food might not want others to take it, even if it's going to waste. \n\nThen, there's the social aspect. Even if the intention is to reduce waste, doing so in public could be considered inconsiderate. Others at the same table might find it distasteful or uncomfortable, which is why the girlfriend is upset. The writer is being insensitive to their feelings, even if they don't see it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer's argument is about choice and autonomy. They feel it's their right to take the food to prevent waste. But personal autonomy has limits when it affects others. The key here is balancing individual actions with the impact on those around them. \n\nSo, the author's actions might not be illegal, but socially, they're causing discomfort and disrespect. The restaurant's policy might also matter\u2014if they allow it, then maybe it's okay, but if not, the author is violating their rules. Since the question doesn't mention the restaurant's stance, but the social reaction is strong, the author is likely in the wrong for not considering others' feelings and possible rules.\n"
