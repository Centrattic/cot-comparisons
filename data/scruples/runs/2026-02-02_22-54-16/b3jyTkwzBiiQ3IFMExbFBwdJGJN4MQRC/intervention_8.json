      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author says they do this because the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defensive, saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most places, taking someone else's leftovers without their permission is considered rude or inappropriate. Even if the food is left behind, people generally expect that it's not theirs to take. Restaurants usually have policies against this to avoid disputes or hygiene issues. \n\nThen there's the perspective of the people with them. The girlfriend is upset, which matters because relationships involve mutual respect and consideration. The author's argument is about personal choice, but when in a group, one's actions can affect others' comfort. The line between personal freedom and respecting others' feelings is important here.\n\nAlso, the justification of preventing waste\u2014while valid, the method of taking the food is questionable. Restaurants might handle leftover food differently, like donating it, but the author is taking it directly from another table. That's a bit of a stretch legally and ethically, unless it's explicitly allowed by the establishment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking without asking might be seen as theft, even if small. It's about respecting others' property. Even if the food is left, it's not publicly available. The author's actions could be intrusive and make others uncomfortable, which their girlfriend is pointing out. \n\nThe author's insensitivity in dismissing others' reactions as controlling adds to the issue. It shows a lack of empathy towards their companions. So, while the intention to reduce waste is good, the method and the disregard for others' feelings might make the author in the wrong.\n"
