      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The situation says that when people at nearby tables leave, the author takes their leftovers to avoid them going to waste. Their girlfriend and others are upset, finding it disgusting and embarrassing. The author justifies it as their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Eating someone else's leftovers without their consent is generally considered rude. People might feel uncomfortable or invaded if someone else takes their food, even after they've left. So, from a social etiquette standpoint, this could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nThen there's the issue of consent. The original diners didn't give permission for others to take their food. Even if it's going to be thrown away, it's still their property until the restaurant decides to discard it. Taking it without asking could be a violation of their privacy or personal space.\n\nThe author argues that it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. But in public places, actions can affect others. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the behavior is causing discomfort or embarrassment, which might not be about control but about the social impact. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they have good intentions of reducing waste.\n\nHowever, the author's intention to prevent food waste is valid. There are other ways to handle that, like asking the server if they can take the leftovers or donating them through proper channels. Taking direct action without considering others' feelings might be where the problem lies.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The action has a negative impact on others, so it's not entirely acceptable. But the intention isn't malicious. Still, social norms and respect for others' belongings and space are important. The answer likely hinges on balancing personal choice with social responsibility.\n"
