      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author justifies it by saying the food would go to waste, but their girlfriend and friends find it disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most cultures, eating someone else's leftovers without their permission is considered inappropriate. People generally expect their food to be for their own use, and taking it could be seen as a violation of personal space or boundaries. Even if the food is left behind, it's not public property. The author might not be stealing in a legal sense, but socially, it's frowned upon.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting others' property. Just because something is going to be thrown away doesn't mean it's acceptable to take it. People might have specific reasons for leaving food, like dietary restrictions or simply not finishing their meal. The author's action could make others uncomfortable, especially since their partner is upset. Respect for others' feelings and boundaries is important in relationships, so dismissing their concerns as controlling might be the real issue here.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice, but in a shared space like a restaurant, actions that affect others (like eating their leftovers) aren't purely personal. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's a social setting where others are present. The author's behavior could also reflect poorly on their group, causing embarrassment. While the intention to reduce waste is commendable, there are other ways to do that, like donating the food or asking the restaurant to take it. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions are good, the action itself is socially insensitive. The key point is whether the author respects others' boundaries and the potential discomfort caused. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
