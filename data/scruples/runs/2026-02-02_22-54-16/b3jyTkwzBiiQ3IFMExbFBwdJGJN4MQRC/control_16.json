      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The author takes food from other tables after people leave, arguing that it would go to waste. Friends and the girlfriend find it disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their choice as their own.\n\nLegal perspective: In most places, once a customer leaves, the food is no longer their property. Restaurants might have policies against this, so taking it could be theft. But sometimes, they might allow staff to take leftovers. However, as a customer, taking others' leftovers might violate restaurant rules.\n\nEthical angle: Even if it's not illegal, is it respectful? People might find it intrusive or unsanitary. The author's friends are upset, which suggests social norms are against it. The author's argument about reducing waste is valid, but there might be other ways, like asking staff or donating leftovers to food banks.\n\nAuthor's stance: They think it's their choice. But public actions can affect others. Even if it's their choice, it might be considered inconsiderate to others who are uncomfortable. The girlfriend's reaction indicates a personal boundary being crossed, which is a relationship issue.\n\nSo, balancing legal, ethical, and social aspects. The author's actions might not be illegal, but they are likely socially unacceptable. The author is in the wrong because their actions cause discomfort to others and violate social norms, even if they see it as reducing waste. So the answer is A.\n"
