      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. The author says they do this to avoid food waste, but their girlfriend and others think it's disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the social norms. In most places, I think taking someone else's food without their permission is a big no-no. Even if the food is left behind, it's still their property. People might leave food for various reasons\u2014maybe they're done, maybe they didn't finish, but others might have different cultural or personal views on it. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author isn't asking the other people if they can take their leftovers. So, even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission could be seen as violating someone's personal space and belongings. Restaurants might have their own policies about this too. Some places might expect you to leave the food for staff to handle, like donating it or disposing of it properly.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is another point. She's upset, which suggests that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationship. The author's response that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior might come off as dismissive. Relationships require mutual respect, and if the girlfriend is uncomfortable, the author needs to consider her feelings even if they don't share the same view.\n\nAlso, there's the question of public perception. Even if the author isn't doing harm in terms of food waste, the act of taking someone else's leftovers could be seen as inconsiderate or even rude. It's possible that the author is missing the social cues of appropriateness here.\n\nOn the flip side, the intention to reduce waste is commendable. But there are other ways to do that, like eating the leftovers from their own meal or checking with the restaurant about donating food. Taking others' leftovers without permission might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author's intention is good, the method is problematic. It's about respecting others' property and considering social norms. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions are causing discomfort and they're not getting consent.\n"
