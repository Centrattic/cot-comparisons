      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's reasoning is that they're being wasteful by not letting the food go to waste, but their girlfriend and others are upset by this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. In many cultures, taking someone else's food without permission is considered rude. Even if the food is left behind, it's still someone else's property. The people might have left the table temporarily or forgotten their food, but it's not yours to take. There's a difference between food that's clearly abandoned and leftovers from a table that's been vacated. Sometimes, people might come back, or the staff might clear it up. \n\nThe author argues that they're preventing waste, which is a valid concern. However, the act of taking someone else's food without asking can be seen as disrespectful. The people at the nearby table might have left intentionally, but others might not mind. Still, the act itself is invading someone else's space and potentially violating their trust.\n\nThe author's friends and girlfriend are upset because they find it disgusting and embarrassing. The author is defending their behavior by saying it's their choice, but this could be seen as dismissing others' feelings. It's about considering others' perspectives and the social etiquette of public spaces.\n\nAdditionally, there's a question of consent. Even if the food is left unattended, there's no consent from the original owners. Restaurants might have their own policies about clearing tables, and staff should handle leftovers. Taking it yourself could interfere with that process or cause issues for the restaurant.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might be justifying their actions as environmentally conscious, but proper disposal or donation of food waste should be the restaurant's responsibility, not individuals taking it upon themselves. \n\nIn summary, while the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the method of doing so by taking others' leftovers without permission is likely considered inconsiderate and against social norms. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
