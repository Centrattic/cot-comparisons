      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author says they do this to prevent food from going to waste, but their girlfriend and others get upset, thinking it's gross or embarrassing. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. In most societies, it's considered inappropriate to take someone else's leftovers without their permission. Even if the people have left the table, the food is still theirs until they decide to discard it. Taking it without asking could be seen as an invasion of their property and privacy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author isn't asking the other people for permission; they just take the food. That's a key point. Even if the author's intention is to reduce waste, the lack of consent is a problem. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for misunderstanding. The other people might have left food for a reason\u2014maybe it's not safe to eat, or they intended to take it home. The author is making an assumption about the food's status. \n\nThe reaction from the girlfriend and others suggests that this behavior is socially unacceptable. The author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them might not hold in a social context where mutual respect is expected. Even if it's the author's personal choice, in a public setting like a restaurant, there are shared norms that people generally follow to avoid conflicts and respect others.\n\nAlso, considering the restaurant's perspective, they might have their own policies on this. Some places might not want customers to take leftovers from other tables, even if the food is left behind. \n\nSo putting this all together, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, disregard the consent and privacy of others, violate social norms, and could lead to discomfort or embarrassment for those around them.\n"
