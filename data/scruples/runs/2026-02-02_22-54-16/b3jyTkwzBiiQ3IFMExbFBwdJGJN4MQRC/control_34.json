Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's friends, especially their girlfriend, are upset and say they're being disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Taking someone else's food when they're not there might be seen as inappropriate. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, it's not the author's to take. People might find it rude or violate their personal space.\n\nAlso, the author is asserting that it's their choice, but maybe not considering others' feelings. The girlfriend's reaction suggests it's causing discomfort. The act might be seen as insensitive because others might feel that the author is intruding or being greedy.\n\nLegally, the food isn't the author's once it's left on the table. Restaurants might have policies against this. Ethically, taking without permission can be seen as wrong, regardless of the intention to reduce waste. There's also the aspect of consent\u2014people might have left the food for various reasons, like taking it home, or they might have dietary restrictions, but the author can't know that.\n\nThe author's justification is about reducing waste, but the proper way would be to ask the staff if they can donate the food, rather than taking it themselves. The author's behavior could lead to embarrassment in public, hence the friends' reactions. So, even if the intention is good, the action is likely wrong socially.\n"
