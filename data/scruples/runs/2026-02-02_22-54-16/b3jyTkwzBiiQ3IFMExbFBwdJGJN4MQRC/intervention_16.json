Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's action is taking leftovers from other tables once the people have left. The justification given is that the food would otherwise be thrown away. The main issue here is whether this action is inappropriate or not.\n\nOn one hand, some people might see it as wasteful to not use the food, which makes sense. However, there's also the social aspect. Eating someone else's leftovers, even if they're left behind, can be considered a breach of personal space or etiquette. People might find it uncomfortable or unhygienic, even if logically there's no harm. The girlfriend and others are upset, which suggests that socially, it's frowned upon.\n\nThe author argues it's their choice and that others shouldn't control their behavior. But in social settings, actions can affect others. Even if the food is gone, taking it without permission might make others feel uneasy. Restaurants usually handle leftovers by discarding them, so the author's action could be seen as taking something that wasn't offered. There's also the aspect of respect for others' belongings\u2014leftovers are still owned by the people who ordered them until they leave, and taking them without asking could be seen as stealing, even if the owners aren't there anymore.\n\nThe author's friends and girlfriend are upset, which indicates that this behavior is causing conflict in their relationships. While the author might not think it's wrong from a logical standpoint (saving food), the social norms and others' feelings are important factors. The key here is balancing personal choices with social etiquette and respecting others' boundaries, even if those boundaries seem trivial to the individual.\n\nSo, considering the social implications and the reactions of those around the author, it seems like the author is in the wrong. Their action, while intended to reduce waste, is causing discomfort and disrespecting social norms, leading to valid upset from friends and their partner.\n"
