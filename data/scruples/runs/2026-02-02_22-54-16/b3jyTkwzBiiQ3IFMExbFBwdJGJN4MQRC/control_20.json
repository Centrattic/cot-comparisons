      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. Their girlfriend and others get mad at them. The key points here are about appropriateness and social norms.\n\nFirst, eating someone else's leftovers in a public place like a restaurant\u2014does that make sense? Well, generally, when someone leaves their food, it's considered their property, even if they're not eating it anymore. So taking it without asking could be seen as stealing. Even if the food would be thrown away, it's still someone else's stuff. Restaurants might have policies about this too. \n\nThe person argues it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But social interactions often involve considering others' feelings. The girlfriend is upset, so even if it's \"just food,\" the action is causing distress. That's a big factor. Being insensitive to a partner's feelings is usually a problem. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of public behavior. Doing this in a restaurant could make others uncomfortable, especially nearby diners. It's a shared space, and taking someone else's food might be seen as rude or unhygienic. \n\nSo putting it all together, even if the intention is to reduce waste, the act of taking others' leftovers without permission is likely inconsiderate and against social norms. The author's defense about personal choice doesn't account for the impact on others, especially their partner's feelings. Therefore, they're probably in the wrong.\n"
