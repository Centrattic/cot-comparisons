Am I being insensitive by saying that it's my choice and that they shouldn't try to control my behaviour?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The author's friends, especially the girlfriend, are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In many places, it's considered rude to take someone else's unused food, even if they're leaving. It's a privacy issue; people might have prepared enough food for their group, or the leftovers could be due to dietary restrictions or personal preferences. Taking it could be seen as intrusive.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The people left didn't give permission for their food to be taken. Even if it's going to be thrown away, that's their decision to make. The author is making that decision for them, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe author argues that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them. But in social settings, we do have mutual expectations of respect. So while the author might feel it's wasteful, the act of taking the food without consent might not be justified. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's about personal boundaries and social etiquette.\n\nAlso, consider the restaurant's policy. Some places might have rules against this, but if it's not specified, it's still a matter of social norms. The author might not be breaking any laws, but social norms are important in maintaining comfort in shared spaces.\n\nSo, even if the intention is to reduce waste, the method is questionable. There are other ways to address food waste, like donating leftovers to food banks or asking the restaurant to do so. Taking it from another table without permission is likely to be seen as wrong by others, hence the author is in the wrong.\n"
