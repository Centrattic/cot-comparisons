      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for eating leftovers from other people's tables at restaurants. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author says that when people at nearby tables leave, they eat the leftovers because otherwise, the food would go to waste. But their girlfriend and others with them get mad, calling them disgusting and embarrassing. The author defends their actions by saying it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, from a social etiquette perspective, I think taking someone else's leftovers without permission is pretty rude. Even if the food is left behind, it's not yours to take. Restaurants usually handle leftovers by either keeping them or throwing them out, but guests taking them could be seen as stealing. Also, the people at the next table might have left food for various reasons\u2014maybe they're done, maybe they want to take it home, or maybe they just left temporarily. Taking their food without knowing could violate their privacy or expectations.\n\nThe author mentions that their partner and friends are upset. That's a strong indicator that this behavior is not socially acceptable in their circle. The author's argument that it's their choice and others shouldn't control them... Well, yes, you have your own choices, but when those choices negatively affect others or are against social norms, it's reasonable for others to object. Also, respecting others' property and choices is part of being considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to reduce waste, which is a valid concern. Maybe there's a better way to address food waste, like supporting restaurants that donate leftovers or using their own leftovers. But taking from others' tables isn't the right approach.\n\nI think the key points here are respect for others' belongings and social norms. Even if the food would be thrown away, taking it without permission is not appropriate. The author's actions are causing discomfort to others, which is a sign of insensitivity. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
