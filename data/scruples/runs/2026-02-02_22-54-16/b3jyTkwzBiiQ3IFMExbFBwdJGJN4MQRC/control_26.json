      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The question is between A (yes) and B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The person takes leftovers when others leave, saying it prevents waste. Their girlfriend and others are upset, thinking it's disgusting and embarrassing. The author argues it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior.\n\nSo, is this acceptable? Well, from a social norms perspective, taking someone else's leftovers without permission might be seen as inappropriate. Even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without consent could be considered intrusive or violating personal space. Restaurants might have policies about this, but the main issue is social etiquette.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about reducing waste, which is a good intention, but the method might not be respectful. Others might find it creepy or invasive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it's causing conflict in their relationship. The author's stance that it's their choice ignores the feelings and boundaries of those around them.\n\nLegally, the food is on the establishment's property, so maybe there's no law against it. But socially, it's about respect and consent. Even if no one is physically stopping them, the social backlash indicates that it's frowned upon. The author's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intent is good.\n\nSo, balancing the intent (reduce waste) against the impact (insensitivity and making others uncomfortable), it's likely that the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
