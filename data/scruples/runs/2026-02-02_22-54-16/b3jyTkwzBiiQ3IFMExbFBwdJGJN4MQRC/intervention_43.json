      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who eats leftovers from other tables at restaurants is in the wrong. They mentioned that their girlfriend and others find it disgusting and embarrassing, but they think it's their choice. The user wants to know if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most restaurants, especially in public spaces, people expect their food to be personal. When others leave, taking their leftovers might be seen as intrusive. Some places might even have rules against it. But wait, sometimes restaurants donate leftovers, but individuals aren't part of that process.\n\nThen there's the aspect of privacy and boundaries. Even if the food is left behind, entering someone else's personal space at a table could be considered rude. People might leave food for various reasons, and taking it without permission could violate their expectations of privacy.\n\nHygiene is another factor. Others might not want someone else handling their used plates or utensils, which could spread germs. Even if the author thinks it's a waste, others might see it as a health concern.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to prevent waste, which is commendable. However, the method might not be socially acceptable. The girlfriend's reaction is about their relationship dynamics. The author's insistence on personal choice versus respecting others' comfort is a conflict here.\n\nLegally, is there a problem? Probably not, since the food is already paid for and abandoned. But socially, it's a different story. Restaurants might have policies against it to maintain customer comfort.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a matter of social etiquette rather than legal wrong. They might be well-intentioned, but the social norms and others' feelings suggest they are in the wrong in terms of social behavior. The key is balancing personal choice with respecting others' boundaries.\n"
