      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who eats other people's leftovers at restaurants is in the wrong. The user is asking if their actions are acceptable, and their girlfriend and others are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and etiquette around this. When people order food at a restaurant, it's their property. Even if they leave the table, the food still belongs to them. Taking their leftovers without permission could be seen as stealing. Restaurants have policies where staff might take leftover food after a certain time, but customers taking it themselves? That's probably not allowed.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal boundaries and respect. If someone leaves their food, maybe they didn't finish it for a reason, or maybe they just want to leave. Taking it without asking could be intrusive. The person's girlfriend is upset, which suggests that this behavior is causing emotional discomfort. The author's argument is that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. But in social settings, actions do affect others, and respecting others' property and feelings is important.\n\nAlso, the justification that the food would go to waste might not hold weight. Many restaurants donate leftovers to shelters or have other disposal methods. The author is taking it themselves, which might not be the best way to address food waste. Plus, even if the food is going to be thrown away, taking it without permission still crosses a line.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're taking others' property without consent, which is disrespectful and can be seen as stealing. The social norms and the upset of their companions support that they are in the wrong.\n"
