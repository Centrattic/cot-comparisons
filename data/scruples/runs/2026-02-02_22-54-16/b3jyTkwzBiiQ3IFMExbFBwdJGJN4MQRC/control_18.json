      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about eating other people's leftovers at restaurants. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for doing that, even though their girlfriend and friends think it's disgusting and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. Normally, when someone leaves a restaurant, the staff is supposed to handle any leftovers. If the people at the table leave, their food is usually considered theirs, and taking it without permission might be seen as inappropriate. Even if the food would go to waste, taking someone else's leftovers without asking could be seen as a violation of their property, even if it's just food.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal responsibility. The author argues that it's their choice and others shouldn't control their behavior. However, in a public setting, actions can affect others. Eating someone else's food might make others uncomfortable, especially if they're nearby. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, even if the intent is to prevent waste.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend and friends are upset, which indicates that the author's behavior is causing negative feelings. While the author might not see it as a problem, the social context and others' reactions are important. It's possible that the author is overstepping by taking food that doesn't belong to them, regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother angle is the restaurant's policy. Some places might have rules about not taking leftovers from other tables. Even if there's no strict rule, the staff is usually the one who decides what happens to leftover food, not other customers. The author might be bypassing proper channels and taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions are likely seen as inappropriate by others, and their defense of personal choice doesn't account for the social and ethical implications of taking someone else's property without permission. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
