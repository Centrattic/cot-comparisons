She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who works part-time, and the author pays all the bills. The incident in question was a $40 takeout where the author forgot their wallet and asked the girlfriend to pay. She had a negative reaction, and now the author wants her to start paying some bills for principle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is paying all the bills because the girlfriend has a part-time job, so maybe her income isn't enough. The author didn't mind before, but this incident made them reconsider. The key points here are communication, fairness, and the reasonableness of the request.\n\nThe author is frustrated because they feel taken advantage of, even though it's just a small amount. But is it fair to make her pay bills just because of one incident? Relationships often involve shared responsibilities, but when one partner is the primary earner, it's common for them to handle most expenses. However, the author might be overreacting. The $40 takeout could have been a trigger for underlying issues, like a desire for more equity in the relationship or the girlfriend not contributing in other ways. The author should have discussed this calmly instead of using the incident as a catalyst to change the financial dynamic abruptly. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is now noticing the imbalance. The author's focus on \"principals\" could be coming off as harsh, especially if the girlfriend's income is truly limited. It's possible that the author is in the wrong if they didn't consider her financial situation and the incident is being used to justify a sudden shift in responsibilities without prior discussion. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author has been handling all expenses and the girlfriend hasn't contributed at all, even in small ways, maybe the author has a valid point about wanting some reciprocity. But the way the author is framing it\u2014using a single incident to demand payment\u2014might not be the right approach. The author should talk about it openly rather than making a unilateral decision based on one event. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're reacting impulsively to one incident without addressing the broader context and communication. Alternatively, B (No) if the author's request for some contribution is reasonable given the girlfriend's part-time work. The key is whether the author considered the girlfriend's perspective and if the demand is proportionate. Since the author didn't mention discussing this before and is making a judgment based on a small amount, it's probably A.\n"
