She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting bills in a relationship. The author, who's in a live-in relationship, has been paying all the expenses because their girlfriend only works part-time. But after a small incident where the author couldn't pay for takeout and asked the girlfriend to cover it, she reacted negatively. The author is now considering making her start contributing more, even though they admit she can't cover a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author has been handling all the financial responsibilities, which might be fair if they discussed it and agreed. But the girlfriend's reaction is causing tension. The key points are: the author is upset over a minor incident, feels the need to make the girlfriend pay even if she can't afford much, and is approaching this out of principle.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, expecting some level of shared responsibility is normal in a relationship, especially when living together. However, the way the author is approaching it\u2014making her pay after a single incident\u2014might be too abrupt. They should have had a conversation about splitting bills based on their financial situations. The girlfriend might not be used to contributing, so the author should handle it more sensitively. Also, the author's frustration over a $40 expense might indicate deeper issues about the fairness of their current arrangement. So, while the author's intention to share responsibilities is valid, the method and timing could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong for reacting harshly to a small incident and not addressing the issue through open communication first.\n"
