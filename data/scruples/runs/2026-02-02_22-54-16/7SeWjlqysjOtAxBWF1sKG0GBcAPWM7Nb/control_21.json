She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together. He pays all the bills because she's working part-time. There was an incident where he forgot his wallet, asked her to pay for takeout, and she had a bad reaction. Now he's considering making her pay some bills because of that one event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, which usually means sharing expenses. The author pays everything, which might be because she's working part-time. But maybe he never discussed splitting costs before. The incident with the takeout was a small amount, $40, but it seems like it's causing a bigger issue. His frustration is that she acted \"ugly\" and \"put out,\" which he found offensive. He feels she should start contributing, even if it's just in principle.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, if they live together, it's typical for both partners to share costs. However, if she's only working part-time, maybe her income isn't enough. The author might be assuming she should pay more, but if her income is low, expecting her to take on bills might be unfair. The problem is the approach. Making her pay because of one incident might be reactive rather than addressing the underlying issue. Maybe they need to have a conversation about splitting expenses based on their incomes rather than punishing her over a single event. The author's frustration is valid if he's paying everything, but the way he's handling it could be the issue. He's using a small incident to enforce a change, which might be inconsiderate of her financial situation. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong for making it about that one incident rather than discussing a fair arrangement.\n"
