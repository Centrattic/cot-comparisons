I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his girlfriend to start paying some bills after a single incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together. The author pays all the rent and bills because his girlfriend only works part-time. The incident was a $40 takeout where he asked her to pay, and she reacted negatively. Now he's considering making her contribute more, even though she can't cover a lot.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, splitting bills is a common point of contention in relationships. The author has been covering everything, which might be unfair if the girlfriend is capable, even part-time. But the trigger was a small expense, and the author is making a principle stand over one event. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was negative, but the author is now considering changing the financial arrangement. The key points are: 1) The author is unilaterally changing the agreement without prior discussion. 2) The amount in question was trivial. 3) The girlfriend's part-time job might not cover much, so expecting her to contribute could be reasonable, but the approach matters.\n\nIf the author didn't discuss this before, he's imposing a new rule without considering her perspective. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement. The fact that he's reacting to a single incident might show he's overreacting. Also, the fact that he's paying all bills because she works part-time might be a financial arrangement they both agreed on, which he's now altering without discussion.\n\nSo, the author's mistake is not communicating first. Even if splitting bills is fair, the approach here is abrupt and possibly unfair given her income. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making a unilateral decision based on a minor incident without discussing their financial responsibilities together.\n"
