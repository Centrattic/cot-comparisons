She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together. The author pays all the bills, and the girlfriend only works part-time. There was an incident where the author couldn't pay for takeout and asked the girlfriend to handle it. The girlfriend reacted negatively, and now the author feels upset and wants her to start paying some bills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because they've been covering all expenses, which is a lot, and this one incident where the girlfriend didn't want to pay for the takeout made them realize they want her to contribute more. The girlfriend's situation is that she has a part-time job, so maybe she doesn't earn much, but the author points out that her little income might not have any expenses since she's not contributing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to want her to start paying some bills over this incident. The author argues that it's about principle, not the amount. The girlfriend's reaction was negative, which might have been due to feeling taken advantage of or unappreciated. But the author is justifiably upset because they've been covering everything and want fairness.\n\nPossible angles: Financial responsibility in relationships. Does the author have the right to expect equal contribution? The amount in question was small, but it's the principle. The girlfriend might feel that part-time work doesn't allow her to contribute much. The author might be overreacting to a minor incident but is trying to set boundaries. \n\nAnother point: Communication. Maybe the author should have discussed their feelings about splitting bills sooner rather than waiting for this incident. However, the incident acted as a catalyst. The key is whether making her pay some bills is a fair response given her circumstances. If she can't afford it, it might be unfair. But the author could argue that even a small contribution is fair.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting fairness. However, the approach might be the issue. Making her start paying after this single incident without considering her financial limitations could be problematic. But the user's stance is that the author isn't wrong, and I need to assess that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions it's about principle. Maybe the girlfriend's reaction was due to feeling that the author never asked her to contribute before, so this was the first time. The author might need to have a conversation about shared responsibilities rather than just making a unilateral decision.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer could be B (No), because the author's desire for fairness isn't wrong, but it's important how they approach it. However, the situation might be more nuanced. But based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to adjust the financial contributions after this incident.\n"
