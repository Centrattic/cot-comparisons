She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the girlfriend should start paying some bills after a single incident. The author mentions that he pays all the rent and bills because she only works part-time. But when he forgot his wallet and asked her to pay for under $40 takeout, she had a bad attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one covering all the expenses, and the girlfriend is working part-time. Maybe she's not earning enough to contribute meaningfully, but the author wants her to start sharing the load \"just out of principal.\" The key point here is the principle of splitting responsibilities, even if the financial contribution isn't equal.\n\nBut then, the author is making her pay because of one incident. That might be a bit harsh. The question is whether a single event justifies changing the arrangement. Relationships often require understanding and communication. If the author was upset about how she reacted, maybe he should have discussed it first instead of using that as a reason to impose a new rule. \n\nAlso, the amount in question is under $40, which isn't a huge sum. The author's frustration seems more about her attitude than the actual cost. The girlfriend might have felt it was unfair if she's already struggling with part-time work. Maybe she didn't have the money at all, and the author is now making her responsible for bills she can't afford, which could create more tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the attitude was disrespectful, especially since he usually pays everything. But is it right to retaliate by making her take on more financial responsibility over a minor incident? It could be seen as holding a grudge or not being considerate of her financial situation. \n\nI think the author's main issue is the principle of the girlfriend contributing, but using a single takeout incident to enforce that might be too abrupt. It would be better to have a conversation about shared responsibilities and how to approach it fairly. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more understanding and for making a significant change based on one event.\n"
