She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting bills with a girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is living with his girlfriend and currently paying all the bills. He mentions she only works part-time, so maybe she earns less. The issue arose when he asked her to pay for takeout, which cost under $40. She reacted badly, and now he's considering making her pay some bills out of principle, even though she can't afford much.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and expectations in a relationship. The author has been covering everything, which might have been an unspoken agreement. But when he asked her to pay for a small amount, her reaction upset him. He's now thinking about making her contribute more, not just for the takeout incident but in general.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong about wanting her to contribute, especially if they live together. But the issue is whether making her pay some bills over a single incident is fair. The takeout was a minor expense, and her reaction could be due to feeling it's unfair because she's the one with less income. The author might be right to want her to contribute more, but the approach here is about a single incident. Maybe he's overreacting by holding onto this one event and using it as a reason to change the financial arrangement.\n\nAlso, relationships require communication. If he hasn't discussed this before, suddenly enforcing payment might be a shock. The principle here is about fairness, but if she's on a lower income, expecting her to take on more than she can handle could be unfair. The author might need to consider her financial situation and find a middle ground rather than making a drastic change based on one incident.\n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he's making a significant change based on a minor event and not considering her financial limitations. Alternatively, he's justified in wanting her to contribute. But given the context, maybe he's being unreasonable. I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the incident is trivial and the approach is abrupt without considering her circumstances.\n"
