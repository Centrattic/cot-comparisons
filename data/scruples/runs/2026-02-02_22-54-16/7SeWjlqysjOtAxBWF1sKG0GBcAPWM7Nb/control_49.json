She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting bills between a girlfriend and the author who's currently paying everything. The girlfriend works part-time, and there was an incident where the author made her pay for takeout because he forgot his wallet. The girlfriend's reaction was negative, and the author now wants her to contribute more, even though he acknowledges she might not be able to cover much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship where he's the primary earner, which is common in many relationships. However, the girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. The author is upset about her reaction to paying for a small takeout. \n\nI should think about whether making her pay for that takeout was fair. The author didn't seem to have any money on him, so he asked her to pay. But maybe the issue is about setting expectations. If the author has always paid for everything, suddenly expecting her to cover a small expense without prior agreement could be jarring. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that this is unfair given the existing arrangement.\n\nAlso, the author mentions wanting her to start paying some bills \"out of principal.\" That might indicate he's trying to adjust the financial balance, but if he hasn't discussed this with her before, it could be seen as abrupt. Communication is key here. The author might be projecting his own feelings about fairness, but the girlfriend's perspective could differ. She might feel that her part-time job is already contributing in other ways, like with household chores or emotional support, which aren't monetary.\n\nAnother angle is the amount in question. The takeout was under $40, which is minor in the grand scheme. The author's frustration seems disproportionate to the amount. His comment about her \"little\" income might imply he's dismissive of her financial contributions, even if they're small. It's possible he's not considering that her part-time job does come with expenses, like transportation or work-related costs, which might affect her ability to contribute to bills.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel that splitting expenses is fair, especially if the relationship is moving towards a more permanent partnership. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014based on a single incident\u2014could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend might need time to adjust her income or there might be other factors affecting her ability to contribute more.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging the existing arrangement and the girlfriend's financial limitations. The key issues are communication, proportionality, and mutual understanding. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be lacking in these areas, leading to him being at fault.\n"
