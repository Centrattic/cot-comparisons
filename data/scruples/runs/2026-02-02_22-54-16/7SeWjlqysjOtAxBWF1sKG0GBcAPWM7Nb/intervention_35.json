She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living together where the author pays all the bills. The girlfriend works part-time, and the author is upset because she got angry when he asked her to pay for a $40 takeaway. The author is considering making her start paying some bills because of this incident.\n\nFirst, the author is the one who made the decision to have the girlfriend pay for the takeaway. He left his wallet, so it's his mistake. He could have covered it himself if he had his wallet. Instead, he asked her to pay, which might have been a bit unfair since he usually pays everything. The girlfriend's reaction might have been due to surprise or feeling that this was sudden and without prior agreement. \n\nThe author is frustrated because he usually pays everything, and this incident made him realize he wants her to start contributing. But is it fair to hold this one incident against her? Making her pay some bills based on this might be a bit of a reaction instead of a well-considered decision. The girlfriend's job is part-time, so her ability to contribute might be limited. The author might need to consider her financial situation more.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. Instead of using this incident as a catalyst to change the financial arrangement without discussing it, the author should have had a conversation about their expectations. The fact that the author is focusing on a $40 bill might indicate that he's using this as an excuse to shift responsibility, which could be a problem. \n\nSo, even though the author might feel justified in wanting her to contribute, the way he's approaching it without considering her perspective or communicating properly could be where he's in the wrong. The incident itself was his mistake (leaving the wallet), and her reaction might have been a valid response to being asked to pay unexpectedly. Therefore, the author's reaction might be the unfair part here."
