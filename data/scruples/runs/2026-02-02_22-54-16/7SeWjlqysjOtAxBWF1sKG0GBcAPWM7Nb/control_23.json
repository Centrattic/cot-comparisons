      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey live with their girlfriend, and she only works part-time. He's been paying all the rent and bills until a recent incident. They went to get takeout, and he forgot his wallet. He asked her to pay, and she reacted negatively\u2014she was surprised, maybe even upset, and acted put out. The cost was under $40. Now he's thinking about making her start paying some bills, not just because of her income but as a matter of principle.\n\nFirst, let's consider their living arrangement. He's been paying all expenses. She works part-time, which might mean she has limited income. If she's not working full-time, her ability to contribute might be constrained. But he's suggesting that even a small contribution is needed for principle's sake. The incident with the takeout seems to have triggered this thought.\n\nHe's upset about her reaction to paying for the takeout. She might have felt it was unfair since she's contributing little otherwise, or maybe she felt it was unexpected. Her reaction could be due to frustration from not being involved in financial responsibilities before. Maybe she's used to not having to contribute because he's been covering everything.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's considering making her pay bills because of her reaction to a small expense. But he's been covering everything, so maybe her expectation was that he would always pay. However, he might feel that fairness requires some contribution from her, even if small. But is it fair to start holding her responsible only after this incident?\n\nOn one hand, he's asking her to contribute to something that's a minor expense, which might be reasonable. On the other hand, if he's been covering all the major expenses and she's been contributing in other ways (maybe with chores, emotional support, etc.), maybe her reaction is about feeling the balance is unfair. If she's not in a position to contribute financially due to her part-time job, expecting her to pay bills might be unrealistic unless they can adjust their overall financial arrangement.\n\nAlso, the situation is about principle. He might feel that fairness dictates some financial contribution from her, but if she's not earning much, expecting her to start paying might not be feasible. It could lead to resentment if she can't afford it. He should consider discussing their financial expectations and responsibilities rather than making a unilateral decision based on one incident.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's suddenly making her pay bills because of her reaction to a small takeout cost, without considering her financial situation and without prior discussion, that might be unfair. He might be overreacting to a minor incident and using it as a catalyst to enforce a change that wasn't discussed. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her circumstances and for not having an open conversation about their financial arrangements.\n"
