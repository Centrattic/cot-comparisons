She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The scenario is about a couple where the guy is paying all the bills because his girlfriend works part-time. A minor incident happens when they go out for takeout, and he asks her to pay because he left his wallet. She reacts negatively, and he's upset about her attitude. Now he's considering making her pay some bills because of this one incident.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The guy has been paying everything so far, which he didn't mind until this incident. The girl works part-time, so maybe she's used to not contributing financially. The takeout was under $40, and he's frustrated that she took offense. He feels she should start contributing, even if she can't cover much, just for principle.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's been paying all the bills, so that's a given. The girl might feel she's contributing in other ways, like emotional labor or household responsibilities. The incident itself is small, $40 isn't huge. His reaction might be disproportionate because he's using one event to make a big change in their financial arrangement. That could be unfair, especially since her part-time job might not allow her to contribute much. He's focusing on a principal issue, but maybe he's not considering her perspective or the existing balance of their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, she might have felt that this was an unfair request given the usual setup. Her reaction could stem from feeling it's a big deal when he's never asked before. He's now changing the dynamic after a single incident, which could be seen as unfair. So, he might be in the wrong because he's making a significant change based on a minor event without discussing it. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement, so he should have talked it over instead of unilaterally deciding she should pay more.\n"
