She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author and their girlfriend live together. The author pays all the rent and bills because the gf only works part-time. Then, there was an incident where the author forgot their wallet and asked the gf to pay for $40 takeout. The gf's reaction was negative, and the author is now considering making her start contributing to the bills.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is upset about a single incident where the gf didn't want to pay for takeout. The author feels like they've been paying everything and wants the gf to start contributing more, even if it's just in principle. The key points here are the financial arrangement, the reaction to the incident, and the author's plan to make the gf pay more.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they've been covering all expenses, which is their right since they earn more. The gf, working part-time, might have less income. The author is upset not just about the $40 but about the gf's attitude. They feel it's time for her to \"carry her weight.\"\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Financial arrangements in relationships can be tricky. If the couple is in a committed relationship, splitting responsibilities or financial contributions can depend on their agreement. The author didn't mention a prior agreement, so maybe they assumed it was okay to pay everything. However, the gf might not have expected to start contributing immediately or at all, especially if the author had been covering everything up to now.\n\nThe author is making the gf pay because of one incident. That might be a reaction based on hurt feelings rather than a fair assessment of their financial situation. The $40 takeout is a small amount, and the author's frustration seems to stem from the gf's reaction rather than the cost itself. The author is now considering making her pay some bills \"just out of principal,\" which could be seen as a punishment for the incident rather than a fair adjustment of their financial responsibilities.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed the financial contributions beforehand. If the author is now changing the terms because of a single incident, it might be unfair. The author might be projecting their own frustration onto the gf. The gf's reaction could be due to feeling suddenly responsible when she wasn't before, which the author might have contributed to by not addressing the topic earlier.\n\nSo, the author's decision to make the gf start paying bills based on a single incident, without prior discussion, could be seen as the author being in the wrong. They're making a significant change in their financial arrangement due to a minor incident, possibly without considering the gf's perspective or the existing dynamic. The author might be holding the gf to a standard that wasn't communicated, leading to the conflict.\n"
