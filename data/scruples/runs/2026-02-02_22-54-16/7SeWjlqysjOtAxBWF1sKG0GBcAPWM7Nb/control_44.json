I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong when they want their girlfriend to start paying some bills after a single incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple lives together, the author pays all the bills, and the girlfriend works part-time. The incident was a $40 takeout where the author asked her to pay, and she had a negative reaction. The author feels they should start splitting expenses because the girlfriend's attitude was unacceptable.\n\nHmm, from a fairness perspective, splitting costs when living together is common, but the author is not requiring her to pay for everything. However, the trigger was a small amount and a one-time issue. The author is making a general rule based on one event. That might be a bit harsh. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling suddenly responsible for something she wasn't used to. Also, the author hasn't had this expectation before, so her surprise makes sense. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about principle\u2014wanting her to start contributing. But if the relationship has been one where the author pays everything, changing that suddenly could be seen as unfair, especially if the girlfriend's income is limited. The key points are the sudden change in expectations after a single incident and the size of the expense. The author might be overreacting because it's a minor issue. \n\nHowever, the author does have a point about sharing responsibilities. But the way they're responding\u2014making her pay some bills over a $40 incident\u2014might be disproportionate. The problem here is that the author is holding a grudge over a small matter and using it as a catalyst for a larger change without prior discussion. That could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the girlfriend didn't realize contributing was expected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're making a significant change in the relationship dynamics based on a minor incident without considering their partner's perspective. They should have communicated their expectations sooner rather than using a single event as leverage.\n"
