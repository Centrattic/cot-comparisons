She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy pays all the bills and his girlfriend only works part-time. They went out for takeout, he forgot his wallet, and she had to pay. He's upset about her attitude and wants her to start contributing more.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The guy is frustrated because he always pays for everything and feels that this one incident where she had to pay $40 was met with a negative reaction. He wants her to start covering some bills for the principle of it. The girlfriend's side isn't fully presented, but she works part-time, which might mean she has limited income. She might feel that the guy is always taking care of everything and now is holding one incident over her head to demand more contributions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the issue is about fairness and communication. If they live together, splitting expenses is usually a mutual agreement. The guy paying all might be because he's higher earning, but if the girlfriend can contribute a little, it's reasonable. However, changing this after one incident could seem abrupt. Also, expecting her to handle $40 when she's part-time might not be fair, especially if her income is low. The guy's reaction might be overreacting to a small matter, using it as a reason to shift responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the way he's approaching it\u2014calling her attitude \"ugly\" and acting disgusted\u2014might indicate he's being judgmental. Maybe she was upset because she was used to him covering everything and felt pressured. The guy might be in the wrong for using a minor incident to demand a bigger change without discussing it first. Open communication is key in relationships, and perhaps he should have talked about splitting expenses more gradually instead of reacting to one takeout incident.\n"
