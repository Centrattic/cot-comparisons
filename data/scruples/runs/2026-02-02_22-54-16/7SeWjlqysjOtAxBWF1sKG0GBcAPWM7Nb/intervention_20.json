She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their girlfriend to start paying some bills after a single incident. The scenario involves the author paying all the bills while the girlfriend works part-time. The incident was the author forgetting their wallet, so the girlfriend had to pay for takeout, which she didn't like.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been paying everything, and the girlfriend's reaction was negative. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nIs it fair to ask someone to start contributing after a one-time issue? The girlfriend's part-time job might not cover much, so expecting her to pay bills suddenly could be a financial strain. The author is upset about the takeout incident, which was only $40, but they feel it's time for her to start contributing more.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that since the girlfriend isn't contributing financially, it's unfair. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not be in a position to help, and the author is overreacting to a minor incident. The key here is whether the author is justified in making a big change (like splitting bills) over a small mistake.\n\nAlso, communication is important. The author hasn't discussed this with the girlfriend, just decided to make her pay more after a single incident. That could be seen as unfair because it's based solely on that one situation without considering her financial situation and without talking about it.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're reacting to a minor issue by asking for significant changes without proper discussion. The girlfriend's part-time job might not allow her to contribute much, and the author's approach might be abrupt and unfair.\n"
