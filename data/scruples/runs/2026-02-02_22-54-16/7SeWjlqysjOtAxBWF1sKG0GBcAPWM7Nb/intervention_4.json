She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting their girlfriend to start paying some bills after a single incident. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple lives together. The author pays all the bills, and the girlfriend works part-time. The incident in question is a $40 takeout where the author asked her to pay it, and she reacted negatively. Now the author is considering making her pay some bills as a result.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author might feel that splitting expenses is fair, especially since they live together. The girlfriend's reaction could have been perceived as dismissive or resentful, which might have triggered the author's change in stance. The author might be feeling taken advantage of, especially since they've been paying everything up until now.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend works part-time, so her income is lower. The author is suddenly shifting responsibility after one incident. The cost in question is relatively small, and using a single event to demand financial responsibility could be seen as disproportionate. Relationships often require compromise, and maybe the author is not considering the girlfriend's financial situation fully. \n\nAlso, the way the author is framing it as \"principles\" might be more about feeling slighted in that one instance rather than a fair assessment of their shared living situation. The key here is whether making her pay some bills is a reasonable response or an overreaction based on one event. \n\nI need to think about fairness in shared living. If they both live there, splitting bills is typical, regardless of income. But if the author has been covering everything, maybe they hadn't discussed financial responsibilities before. The girlfriend's reaction might have been the catalyst, but is it fair to base a significant change in financial arrangement on a single $40 incident?\n\nAdditionally, communication is key. The author might be assuming they're in the right, but maybe a conversation about expectations was needed before making unilateral decisions. The author could be projecting their own stress onto the situation, especially if they're feeling like they're carrying all the financial burden.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be to promote fairness, the approach of making a significant change based on a minor incident could be seen as unfair, especially without prior discussion. The answer might hinge on whether the author is overreacting to a small event rather than addressing an ongoing imbalance. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's financial limitations and for using an isolated incident to justify a larger shift in responsibilities.\n"
