She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together. The author pays all the bills, and the girlfriend only works part-time. The issue started when the author asked the girlfriend to pay for a $40 takeout because they forgot their wallet. The girlfriend's reaction was negative, which upset the author. Now the author is considering making her pay some bills in principle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is paying all the bills, which might be a point of contention. The girlfriend works part-time, so maybe her income is limited. The author feels that because of this one incident, the girlfriend should start contributing more. But is that fair?\n\nThe key here is whether the author is justified in making the girlfriend pay bills based on a single event. The author mentions it's about principle. But relationships often require compromise and understanding. The girlfriend might not have had the money, or maybe the way the author approached it made her uncomfortable. The author's frustration is understandable, but should the response be to make her pay more bills immediately?\n\nAlso, splitting a $40 takeout might not be a big issue, but the author is taking it as a sign that the girlfriend isn't contributing. Maybe the author should have discussed the bigger issue of shared expenses earlier instead of reacting to a single incident. It's possible that the author is overreacting and not considering the girlfriend's situation. If the girlfriend's income is low, expecting her to pay bills without prior agreement could be unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is paying everything, it might create an imbalance. The author might feel entitled to a different dynamic. However, the approach of making her pay after one incident without discussing it might be abrupt. The author's reasoning is about principle, but in relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing it could be flawed.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the author's actions are proportionate and considerate of the girlfriend's circumstances. If the author hasn't discussed shared responsibilities before and is now using a single incident as a catalyst, that might be hasty. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her contributions aren't being recognized, or maybe she didn't realize the author expected her to pay. The author's approach could be seen as taking a stand on principle, but the way it's being enforced might be unfair without prior discussion.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're reacting to a minor incident and not considering the girlfriend's financial situation and the lack of prior communication about shared responsibilities.\n"
