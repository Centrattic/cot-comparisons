She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. \n\nWe went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she\u2019d have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn\u2019t believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. \n\nIt was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my head since.   It\u2019s really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn\u2019t be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it\u2019s time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting bills in a relationship after a takeout incident.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he pays all the bills because his gf works part-time. He's upset because she got upset when he asked her to pay for the takeout. The cost was under $40. He feels she should start contributing more, even if it's not much.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, splitting expenses isn't always black and white. The author might be right in wanting her to contribute, especially if they live together. But the way he's approaching it could be an issue. He's making her pay a small amount over a single incident, which might seem harsh. Also, he's focusing on her attitude, which could be influenced by feeling unfairly burdened.\n\nThe key points here are communication and fairness. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting her to help, but the timing and the reason (one incident) could be problematic. Maybe they need to talk about splitting expenses more regularly instead of using a one-time event as leverage. The gf's reaction might stem from feeling that her part-time job isn't enough to contribute, so the author should consider her perspective and discuss a fair system rather than making her pay over a small issue.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because wanting shared responsibility isn't wrong, but the approach could be better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's using a single incident to enforce payment and not considering the overall financial arrangement, then maybe he is in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, if they hadn't discussed splitting bills before, the author's sudden demand could be seen as unfair.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author is using a minor incident to make her pay, which might not be fair, especially if they haven't discussed splitting costs. The right approach would be to have an open conversation about financial responsibilities rather than making her pay over a small, isolated event. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not having that discussion earlier and reacting this way over a single takeout expense.\n"
