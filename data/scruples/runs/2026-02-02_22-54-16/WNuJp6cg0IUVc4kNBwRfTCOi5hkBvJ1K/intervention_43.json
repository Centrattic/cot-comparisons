He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend not taking care of their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, preferring to play video games. The mother tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't consistently help. In a last effort, she puts the baby in his gaming room, pretends to leave, goes to the gas station, and then records a 10-second video of him ignoring the baby. She sends it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The main issue is whether the author (the mother) acted in the wrong by involving the boyfriend's mother. \n\nOn one hand, using a video to show evidence of neglect could be seen as a justified action to get help from the mother-in-law. The mother is clearly stressed and has tried to communicate the problem without success. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. The video serves as proof to support her claims when verbal communication hasn't worked.\n\nOn the other hand, the method she used could be questionable. Pretending to leave and going to the gas station might be seen as a manipulation tactic. Also, involving his mother might be a breach of privacy or trust between the couple. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken in a misleading context, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut considering the circumstances, the mother is in a vulnerable position, caring for an infant alone. The boyfriend's actions could affect the baby's well-being. The author's goal was to get the boyfriend's mother to intervene, and it worked. However, the manner in which she did it\u2014falsely claiming to leave and recording the video without his knowledge\u2014could be seen as deceitful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The intent was to address a serious issue, but the method involved deceit and potentially overstepping boundaries. However, given the neglectful behavior of the boyfriend and the mother's desperation, some might argue that her actions were justified to protect the child and herself.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on the perspective. If we prioritize honesty and privacy, then B (not in the wrong) because she's trying to address neglect. If we consider the deceitful method, maybe A (in the wrong). But since the core issue is the boyfriend's neglect and the mother's actions were to protect the child, the answer is likely B.\n"
