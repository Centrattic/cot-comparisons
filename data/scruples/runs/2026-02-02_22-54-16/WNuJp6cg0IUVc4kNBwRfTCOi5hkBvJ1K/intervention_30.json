He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the context is that the boyfriend has been neglecting his responsibilities as a parent, especially after the birth of their daughter. The author has tried multiple times to communicate this, but he goes back to his old ways. She even staged a scenario where she left the baby with him and took a video when he ignored her. Then she sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The main issue is whether exposing the boyfriend's behavior to his mother was justified. On one hand, the mother might not have been aware of the situation, and the video was a clear documentation. On the other hand, involving parents in adult relationships can be sensitive. However, the key here is the well-being of the child. The boyfriend's neglect is a serious issue, and the mother has a right to know if her son is harming the child or not fulfilling his duties.\n\nAnother angle is the method used. The author staged a situation to catch him in the act. While that might be manipulative, her intent was to gather evidence of neglect, which is a valid concern. The video was short and showed a specific instance, which could be seen as necessary to prove a pattern of behavior.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction to the video being \"out of context\" might be a way to deflect from the real issue. If there's a pattern, a single video could be part of that pattern. The author's actions were to protect the child and seek help when all else failed. In such serious matters, protecting the child's welfare is paramount. \n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions, while perhaps using a questionable method, were driven by the child's well-being. She tried multiple approaches before this, so this might be a last resort to get the boyfriend to change, and if not, to have evidence for legal proceedings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
