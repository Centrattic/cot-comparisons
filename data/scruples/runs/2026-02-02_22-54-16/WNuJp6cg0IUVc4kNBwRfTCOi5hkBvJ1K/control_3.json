He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author tried multiple times to address this, leading to a breakdown where she staged a situation to prove his neglect and sent a video of it to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is causing significant stress. The author has tried communication and even a dramatic act to prompt change. By sending the video to the mother-in-law, she's involving family and using a staged event, which might be seen as manipulative. However, the intent was to protect the child and address the neglect.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary by involving the mother and using a setup. The video might be considered taken out of context, as the boyfriend argues. On the other hand, the mother is in a desperate situation, trying to ensure the child's well-being when the father isn't helping. The ethical dilemma here is between protecting the child and respecting privacy and trust in the relationship.\n\nIt's important to note that the author's primary concern is the child's welfare, which is a strong point. However, the method chosen could damage trust and relationships further. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on involving family in such matters. Some might argue that the ends justify the means if the child's safety is at risk, while others might see the means as unethical regardless.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's method of addressing it could be questioned. The question is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to protect the child, but there's a valid argument for A (in the wrong) due to the deceptive tactics used. However, given the severity of the neglect, the protective intent might outweigh the method's issues.\n"
