He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not helping with the baby, leading to the author sending a video to his mom. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has a 5-year relationship, a daughter who's 6 months old. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, preferring to play games. The author has tried talking about it, but he relapses. She tried leaving the baby in his room to test him, which he failed. She took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think through the ethical aspects here. The author's actions were to expose her partner's neglect, using a video to involve his mother. She did this after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's behavior is clearly neglectful, but the method of confronting it might be questionable.\n\nIs there a right or wrong way to handle this? The author might feel desperate, leading her to take drastic measures. However, involving a parent without discussing it with the partner first could be seen as overstepping. But considering the well-being of the child, maybe it's justified. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The video was taken after she checked on the baby and found him ignoring her. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect the child and seek support. On the other, she didn't directly confront her partner, instead going to his mother. That could be seen as tattling, but if the partner isn't responsive, maybe it's necessary. The boyfriend's reaction of being upset about the video might be because he's defensive, but the core issue is his neglect. \n\nI think the key here is the neglect itself. The author isn't at fault for the neglect; she's trying to address it. Her method might be questionable, but given the circumstances of repeated failure to communicate and the child's welfare, her actions are understandable. So I'm leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong. She's in a tough spot and tried a last-ditch effort to get help, which is a valid response to a serious problem.\n"
