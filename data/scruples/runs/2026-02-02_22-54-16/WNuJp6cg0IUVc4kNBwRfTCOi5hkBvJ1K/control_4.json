He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, instead playing video games. The author has tried communicating, but he reverts to old habits. She stages a scenario by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then records him ignoring the baby and sends the video to his mom. The mom confronts him, he's upset with the author for involving his mother and for the video being out of context.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's main issue is that the boyfriend is not fulfilling his parental responsibilities. She's exhausted from handling everything and feels he's not contributing. The action in question is sending the video to his mother. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's trying to get help from his mother because he's not improving despite her efforts. The video serves as evidence of his neglect. But on the other hand, she staged the situation by putting the baby in his room and leaving, which might be seen as manipulative. Also, using his mother as a mediator could be viewed as overstepping, especially if she knew he has a strained relationship with his mom or if it's a family matter they should handle themselves.\n\nEthically, the baby's well-being is paramount. If dad isn't caring for the child, there's a duty to ensure the child is safe. But the method of using a video and involving the mother might be questionable. Staging the situation could be seen as a trap, which might not be fair. However, given the context that she's been trying to communicate and he hasn't changed, her actions might be a last resort.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014being upset about the video being out of context\u2014could indicate that the situation was more complex than it appeared. Maybe the video didn't show the full picture, even if the core issue is real. But the author's intention was to highlight the neglect, and the result was the mother taking action, which might be necessary.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a tough call. If the mother-in-law's intervention helps the boyfriend realize his responsibilities, maybe the author did the right thing. However, if the method was manipulative or crossed a boundary, then the author might be in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she's acting in the baby's best interest, but there's a case for her overstepping by involving the mother. The key factors are the baby's safety and the boyfriend's pattern of neglect. In such cases, sometimes involving family is necessary when the person isn't responsive to direct communication. However, the staging of the situation could be problematic. The final answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but given the circumstances, her actions could be justified as a last resort to protect the child.\n"
