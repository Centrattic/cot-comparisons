He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter. The author tried to confront him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old ways. She put the baby in his room, left, and took a video when he ignored the baby. Then she sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nHmm. I need to figure out if she did something wrong. Well, the main issue is the boyfriend not helping. The author is the one trying to take care of the baby alone, which is a lot. She's at her breaking point. Using a video to show the mother might be a way to get the boyfriend to change. But is it justified?\n\nFirst, consider the boyfriend's behavior. If he's not fulfilling his parental duties, that's a serious problem. The author has tried talking to him, and he hasn't changed. She's exhausted. In that case, maybe she felt she had no other options left. Sending the video to his mom might be a last resort to get him to take notice or to get the mother to pressure him.\n\nBut then, is it right to involve the mother? Sometimes involving family can cause conflict. However, the boyfriend's actions (ignoring the baby) could be endangering the child. The author is trying to protect the baby, so maybe her actions are in the child's best interest. The video is a factual record of what happened. If the boyfriend is in the wrong, the video supports that.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently. Like, maybe she should have gone to the police or a family counselor instead of involving his mom. But given the situation, she might not have seen another option. The boyfriend's mom might be in a position to influence him, so perhaps the author's action was a strategic move.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of taking the video out of context. The video was taken when the baby was crying and he didn't help. That's a clear example of neglect. If the video is accurate, then it's not out of context. The mother's reaming him out might lead him to realize the seriousness.\n\nSo, weighing the options: The author is in a stressful situation, trying to protect her child. She's tried everything else. Involving the mother might be a necessary step. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
