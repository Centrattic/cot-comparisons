He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for sending the video to her boyfriend's mother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years and had a good relationship until their daughter was born six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby\u2014just\u73a9\u6e38\u620f on the couch and only helps when the author tells him. He even questions why she can't handle it when he's being asked. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, and he improves briefly but then goes back to the same behavior. She's considering divorce and did a test where she left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and came back to find him ignoring the baby's cries. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. The mom called him out, and he's upset with her for involving his mom and claiming the video was out of context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points.\n\nThe author is a parent who's struggling with the other parent not fulfilling his responsibilities. The baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend isn't taking care of the baby, even when asked. The author has exhausted communication and the boyfriend hasn't changed. She tried a test, which is a form of a controlled experiment to see his reaction, and documented it. Then she sent the video to his mother, which led to the mother confronting him.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe she shouldn't have involved the mother without talking to the boyfriend first. In some situations, involving family can cause tension, and it might be better to handle it between the couple. Also, the 10-second video could be out of context, but the author claims it wasn't. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt the video was taken out of context, but the author's intent was to show the neglect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a parent trying to protect her child and is at her breaking point. The boyfriend's behavior is harmful, and the author has tried everything short of leaving. The test she did was a way to provide evidence of his neglect, and by showing it to the mother, she might be trying to get help from another family member to support her cause. The mother's response was to confront him, which could be seen as helping to address the issue.\n\nBut is the author using the right method? Could she have talked to her boyfriend again first? However, he hasn't changed despite multiple discussions. Sending the video was a last resort. In terms of right or wrong, it's a moral judgment. The author's intent was to protect the baby and perhaps get some accountability. The boyfriend's neglect is the core issue here. The act of sending the video might be seen as a justified action given the circumstances, even if it's a harsh step. The mother's reaction might have been necessary to get through to him.\n\nSo, considering the context of child neglect and the author's efforts to resolve the issue without success, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. The key is the child's well-being versus the method of confrontation. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
