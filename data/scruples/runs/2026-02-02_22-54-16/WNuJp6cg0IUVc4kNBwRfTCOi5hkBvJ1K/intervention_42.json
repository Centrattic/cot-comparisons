He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together five years, and after their daughter was born six months ago, the boyfriend refuses to help care for her. He only engages when the baby is screaming and the author tells him to do something. He's neglecting his responsibilities, leading the author to consider divorce. She staged a scenario by putting the baby in his gaming room, told him she was leaving, then went to the gas station. When she came back, he was ignoring the baby, so she took a short video and sent it to his mom. The mom confronted him, he's now upset, and the author is wondering if she was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the boyfriend's neglect, the author's attempts to communicate, and the action of involving the mother. Let's think about each part. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is a significant issue. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even to the point of saying she can't handle it anymore, but he only improves temporarily. That suggests he's not taking the problem seriously or making a consistent effort to change.\n\nNow, the author's action: She put the baby in the room, lied about leaving, then took a video when he didn't respond. Sending it to his mom could be seen as using her as a mediator, which might be a last resort when direct communication isn't working. But is she in the wrong for doing that? Well, the baby was in a situation where the boyfriend didn't respond to her crying. The author's intent was to show the mother the reality of his behavior, which the boyfriend denies as being out of context. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's dealing with a lot of stress and feels unsupported. The video serves as evidence when he's not taking her seriously. But staging the situation by pretending to leave might be manipulative, even if the intention was good. However, the main issue is his neglect of parental duties. Involving a parent to address this could be a way to make him accountable, especially if he's resistant to change otherwise.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving his mother and staging the scenario, which could be seen as deceptive. But considering the context of his ongoing neglect, and the fact that she's exhausted all other options, her actions might be justified. The mother's intervention did lead to his anger, but the root problem remains his unwillingness to help.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's trying to protect her child and address a serious issue that's affecting their family well-being. The method she used was a bit underhanded, but the intent was to get help when he's not responsive. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, and the mother's reaction might actually help him realize the gravity of the situation.\n"
