He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author tattling on her boyfriend to his mother because he's not helping with their newborn daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together five years, had a daughter six months ago. Since the baby's birth, the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, prefers to play video games, and only helps when prompted. The author has tried talking to him, even threatening divorce, but he relapses. She then stages a situation by leaving the baby in his gaming room, goes to the gas station, and records a 10-second video of him ignoring the crying baby. She sends it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author feels overwhelmed and desperate. She's trying to get her partner to take responsibility for their child. Her actions are a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. However, she did stage a scenario by leaving baby alone and then recording evidence. \n\nThere's a debate here about the ethics of staging a situation to prove someone's negligence. Even though her intentions might be good, manipulating the scenario could be seen as deceptive. But from another angle, she's trying to protect the baby's well-being. The father isn't fulfilling his duties, and she's taking action to address the neglect.\n\nIn relationships, especially involving children, both parties have responsibilities. The boyfriend is clearly not meeting his parental duties, which is a major issue. The author's actions, while extreme, might be justified as a means to hold him accountable. However, involving his mother might be seen as overstepping, depending on family dynamics. \n\nBut the core issue is the father's neglect. The author's actions, while perhaps not the best approach, stem from a place of desperation and trying to protect her child. The mother-in-law's reaction might be more about the method than the content, but the father's behavior is the real problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the father's neglect is the primary issue. Her actions, though a bit underhanded, were aimed at ensuring the child's well-being. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
