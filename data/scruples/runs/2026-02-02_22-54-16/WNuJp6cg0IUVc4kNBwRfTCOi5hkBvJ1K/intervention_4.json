He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend isn't helping with their baby, and the girlfriend sent a video to his mom, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend isn't taking care of the baby, despite multiple discussions. The author tried to leave but went to the gas station instead. When she returned, the baby was crying and he was ignoring it. She recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nThe author's actions: She's a parent who's overwhelmed and desperate. She's tried talking, but he's not changing. Sending the video to his mom could be seen as a last resort to get help, especially since there's a baby involved. However, involving in-laws can be sensitive. His reaction is valid in that he might feel it's an invasion of privacy or that the video was taken without consent. But his neglect of the baby is the core issue here. The video was a direct example of his behavior, which the author couldn't resolve through communication. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It's a judgment call. She's in a stressful situation, and protecting the child's well-being is a priority. However, involving the mother might not be the best approach in a relationship, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The main wrong here seems to be the boyfriend's neglect, not the author's action of exposing it to his mom. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
