He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a video to the boyfriend's mother. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, plays games instead, and only helps when told. The author tried talking multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he relapses into old habits. In a moment of desperation, she leaves the baby with him, goes to the gas station, comes back to find him ignoring the baby, records a 10-second video, and sends it to his mom. The mom calls him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend's neglect towards the baby. The author tried communicating directly, which is the standard approach. However, when that didn't work, she escalated by recording and involving the mother. \n\nIn some cases, involving family can be seen as overstepping, especially if it's done without the other person's consent. The boyfriend's reaction is that she took the video out of context, which might imply he feels the situation wasn't fully explained. Also, using a 10-second video could be a snippet that doesn't show the full picture. That might be a point against her. However, the core problem is the ongoing neglect of their child, which is a serious matter. \n\nParenting responsibilities are shared, and if one parent is consistently neglecting their duties, the other has a right to be concerned. But the method of addressing it matters. Instead of involving the mother-in-law, maybe the next step would be legal or involving child services if there's actual neglect. However, the mother-in-law did intervene, which might have been effective short-term but could have long-term relationship issues.\n\nThe author's decision to send the video to the mother-in-law was a way to make the boyfriend accountable. However, it's possible that this action was a breach of trust or privacy, as he didn't consent to being recorded or having it shared. The boyfriend's anger could stem from feeling betrayed. \n\nBut considering the baby's well-being is the priority. If the boyfriend is truly neglecting the child, the author has a duty to protect the child. However, the method of involving the mother might not be the best approach. It's a delicate balance between protecting the child and maintaining the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author acted out of desperation and concern for the baby, but the action of recording and sharing without discussion might be seen as crossing a line. However, if the neglect is ongoing and dangerous, some might argue it's necessary. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer could depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. However, in many cases, involving family without the partner's consent can be problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she took a step that breached trust without a clear, mutual plan. Alternatively, B (No) because she's protecting her child. \n\nBut since the community often looks at these cases, the author is in a tough spot. However, the action of \"tattling\" to the mother might be seen as wrong because it's a family matter that's been escalated without resolving it within the couple first. So, answer A.\n"
