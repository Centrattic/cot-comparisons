He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman whose boyfriend is not helping with their newborn daughter. He's been neglecting the baby, playing video games, and only helping when she's screaming. They've talked about it multiple times, and he improves for a week then goes back. The author tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then came back to find him ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. Now, the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is not fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is a serious issue. The author is clearly stressed and exhausted from handling everything alone. She tried talking, and even a confrontation by leaving, but he's not changing. So she takes a video as evidence to show his mother. \n\nIs sending the video to his mother the wrong move? Well, the boyfriend feels betrayed because she went to his mom. But from the author's perspective, she's desperate and trying to get help. His mom did call him out, which might have made things worse between them. \n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of involving family in a conflict. Generally, people might think that addressing issues directly between the two partners is better. However, in cases of child neglect, some might argue that involving others is necessary to protect the child. \n\nBut the author sent a video to his mom without his knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if her intentions were good, using a video to provoke a reaction from his mother might be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend's reaction to the video being out of context could be valid if the video doesn't show the full situation. But the author's actions were to document the neglect, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the method of addressing it might be questionable. Instead of involving his mother, maybe she could have sought other forms of support, like counseling or mediation. By sending the video to his mom, she escalated the conflict and now the boyfriend is upset with her. \n\nBut considering the severity of the situation\u2014child neglect\u2014some might argue that her actions were justified to ensure the child's well-being. However, the ethics of involving family in such a way without the partner's consent is debatable. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms or personal ethics. In some contexts, involving family to address neglect is acceptable. In others, it's seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction shows he felt wronged by her actions. The author is in a tough spot, but her actions, while perhaps desperate, could be seen as a justified attempt to protect the child. However, the method might be seen as the wrong approach, hence she could be at fault for not handling it differently. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but given the options, the author might be considered in the wrong (A) because she went to his mother without his consent, which is a breach of trust, even if her intentions were good. However, others might side with her (B) because the situation is about child neglect. The community's typical response to such AITA posts often considers the intent and the harm caused. If the video was a necessary step to protect the child, maybe B. But if she could have handled it another way, then A. Since the situation is dire, maybe B is the answer. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check similar cases. Usually, sending evidence of neglect to family is seen as a gray area. Some say it's justified, others not. But since she's preparing to leave him, maybe it's not about the video but about the overall breakdown. I think the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong because her intent was to protect the child. However, the method was questionable. But the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer might be B because the core issue is the neglect, and her action was a response to that. So the answer is B.\n"
