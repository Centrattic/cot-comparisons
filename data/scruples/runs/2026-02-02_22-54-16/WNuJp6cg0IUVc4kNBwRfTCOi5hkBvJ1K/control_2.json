He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him not taking care of their baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, instead playing video games. The author has tried talking to him, even threatening to leave, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. In a moment of desperation, she puts the baby in his room, pretends to leave, goes to the gas station, comes back, records a 10-second video of him ignoring the crying baby, and sends it to his mom with an explanation. The mom calls him out, he's upset, and now the author is considering divorce but is being blamed for tattling.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's main issue is that her partner isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities. She's exhausted and has tried multiple times to address the problem without success. The action she took was to record a video and send it to his mother as a last resort. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, sending the video to his mother could be seen as meddling or not giving him the chance to correct his behavior. Family privacy is important, and involving the mother might not be the best approach. However, the context is that the author has been trying to handle this within the relationship and has failed. The baby's well-being is at stake here. \n\nOn one hand, the act of recording and sending the video without his consent could be considered a breach of privacy. On the other hand, the situation is about the child's care, which is a serious matter. The author might feel that she had no other options left after exhausting all other methods. The tattling aspect is usually when someone reports someone else's actions to an authority figure, but in this case, it's the mother, not an authority. However, if the mother is acting as a parent figure, maybe that's a different angle.\n\nBut considering the circumstances: the author is in a vulnerable state, dealing with a newborn, and the partner's behavior is neglectful. The video was a direct evidence of neglect. While the method might be questionable, the underlying issue is significant. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was justified given the circumstances. Since the author has tried all else and the child's welfare is involved, her actions might be seen as a last resort rather than just tattling. However, there's also the ethical consideration of involving family without the partner's knowledge. But given the severity of the neglect, many might side with the author. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
