He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person (the author of the situation) is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author and her boyfriend have a 6-month-old daughter, and he's not helping with childcare. He plays video games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and only holds her when she's calm. They've talked about it, and he sometimes improves but then backslides. The author tried to leave the baby in his care and went out, then came back to find him ignoring the baby again. She recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is trying to get her partner to take responsibility. She's clearly overwhelmed and frustrated. Sending the video to his mom could be seen as involving family, which might be a breach of trust if they hadn't discussed involving others. But on the other hand, the baby's well-being is a critical factor. If the father is neglecting the child, then the mother (the boyfriend's mom) has a right to know, especially if there's a risk of harm.\n\nHowever, the method she used might be questionable. Instead of addressing the issue with her boyfriend directly, she went to his mother, which could be seen as tattling. The boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and took a video that he says was out of context. That could imply that the video didn't show the full picture, which complicates things. If the video was only 10 seconds, maybe it's a snippet that doesn't capture the entire situation.\n\nBut the core issue is the husband's neglect. The author has tried talking to him, and he hasn't changed. The baby's needs are critical, and a father's responsibility is significant. The author's action might have been a last resort to get his mother to intervene if her son isn't responding to direct communication. On the other hand, the author could have considered other steps, like involving a professional or a counselor before involving the parents. But given the circumstances, maybe the mother-in-law is a key family member who can help.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect her child and get her partner to take responsibility. While involving family can be a sensitive issue, the well-being of the child is paramount. However, the method of sending the video without the partner's consent might be seen as a breach of privacy and trust. The boyfriend's reaction is also important; he feels betrayed, which is a valid emotion. The author might have handled it differently, but her action was driven by desperation and concern for the baby.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a response to ongoing neglect and a failure to resolve the issue through direct communication. While the method might be debatable, the underlying problem is significant. The answer might hinge on whether the author's action was justified given the circumstances. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nI think the key points are the child's well-being, the husband's neglect, the attempts to resolve it directly, and the last-resort action. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a strong point. However, the way she did it by involving the mother without discussing it with her partner first is problematic. The boyfriend's mother is part of his support system, so involving her could be a valid step, but the method of using a video without context might have been a misstep. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The author is in a difficult situation, but her method might have been hasty. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the primary concern for the child's welfare is justified, even if the approach was questionable. Alternatively, considering the breach of trust, it could be A. But given the circumstances, the answer is likely B, as the child's needs are the priority.\n"
