He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that her boyfriend isn't helping with their baby, and after a tense situation, she recorded a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's behavior. He's been neglecting his responsibilities with the baby, not responding when the baby cries, and only helping when prompted. The mother has tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps reverting. This seems like a serious issue because it's about caring for an infant. If a parent isn't fulfilling their duties, that's a big red flag.\n\nThe author's action was to involve the boyfriend's mother. She put the baby in his gaming room, pretended to leave, then recorded a video. The video showed him ignoring the baby. Then she sent it to his mom, who called him out. The boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. The mother is trying to protect the baby and address the neglect. However, involving the mother might have been a last resort. But in the context of child care, ensuring the child's safety is paramount. The method she used\u2014pretending to leave and recording\u2014could be seen as deceptive, but given the circumstances, she might have felt it was necessary to document the neglect.\n\nIn some cases, involving family might be appropriate if the parent is not responding. However, sending the video without the boyfriend's knowledge could be seen as invasion of privacy. But considering the welfare of the child, maybe it's justified. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he feels betrayed, but the mother's primary concern is the baby's well-being.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the mother's actions, while maybe a bit underhanded, were driven by a serious issue. The boyfriend's negligence is the bigger problem here. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
