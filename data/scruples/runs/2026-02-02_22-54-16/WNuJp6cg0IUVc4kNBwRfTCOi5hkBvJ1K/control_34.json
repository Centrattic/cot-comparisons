He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. The situation is that they've been in a relationship for 5 years, and since their daughter was born 6 months ago, the boyfriend refuses to care for the baby. He only helps when the baby is screaming if the author tells him to, and even then, he questions why she can't handle it. He plays video games late and ignores the baby's cries. The author tried telling him multiple times, even threatening divorce, but he keeps reverting. She then placed the baby in his room, said she was leaving, went to the gas station, and took a video of him ignoring the baby when she returned. She sent it to his mom, who called him out, leading to him being upset with her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault (A) or not (B). First, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The author's action was to involve the boyfriend's mother by sending a video as evidence. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, so the author is trying to make him take responsibility. Involving a parent can be a sensitive issue, but the situation is about the well-being of a child. \n\nI should weigh the intent behind the action. The author's intent was to show his mother the reality of the situation to prompt the boyfriend to change his behavior. However, using a video might be seen as an invasion of privacy or as manipulation. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken out of context, especially if the author left the house briefly. Maybe he had a legitimate reason for not responding immediately? But the baby's crying is a distress signal, and ignoring it is a serious issue. \n\nAlso, the author tried other methods (talking, threatening divorce) which didn't work. Sending the video to the mother could be a last resort to get support. However, in some cultures or families, involving in-laws might be frowned upon, but in this case, the mother's reaction was to confront him, which might have been effective. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is being upset about the author involving his mother and the video's context. It's possible he feels betrayed or that the situation was misrepresented. But if the baby was crying and he ignored her, even when the author was out of the house, that's a valid concern. The author had to act in the baby's best interest.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think she's not in the wrong because the baby's welfare is the priority. The boyfriend's behavior is harmful, and she's seeking help through the only means she could think of. But maybe the method was a bit underhanded. However, given the circumstances of neglect, it's a justifiable action to protect the child. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
