He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. Refusing to care for the baby, playing video games while the baby is crying, and only helping when prompted\u2014this is definitely a problem. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he relapses into the same behavior. That shows a pattern of neglect and irresponsibility towards their child.\n\nThe author's action was to place the baby in the gaming room and take a video when he ignored her. Then she sent it to his mother. Now, tattling might be seen as a breach of privacy, but in this case, the stakes are high because the baby's well-being is at risk. The mother's reaction was to confront the son, which led to the boyfriend being upset. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's trying to protect her child and hold her partner accountable. While involving family might not be the first step, the alternative was leaving the situation, which could have long-term consequences for the child. The video serves as evidence of neglect, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. The author's actions were a last resort after repeated failures to communicate effectively. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
