He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author is struggling, has talked to him, but he keeps going back to old habits. She felt she couldn't trust him, so she left the baby with him, took a video of him ignoring the baby, and sent it to his mom. Now, he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is a parent trying to get help for her child, but her partner isn't stepping up. She's exhausted, has tried multiple times to communicate, but it's not working. Her action was to confront his mom, which is a form of involving family, which can be sensitive. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, the child's well-being is a priority. If the father is neglecting his responsibilities, she's acting in the child's best interest. However, involving the mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if the boyfriend feels it's a private matter. But considering the context\u2014multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed, and the baby's needs are not being met\u2014it's more about protecting the child. \n\nAlso, the video is a 10-second clip, which might be a specific moment but it's to show neglect. The boyfriend's reaction (\"taking out of context\") could be a deflection. If the video is a true representation of his behavior after previous promises to improve, then the author's action is justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author's intent was to get help for her child, which is critical. While involving the mother might be a breach of privacy, the severity of the neglect (a child crying and being ignored) could make her actions understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong. The wrong here is the neglect by the boyfriend, not the author's attempt to address it.\n"
