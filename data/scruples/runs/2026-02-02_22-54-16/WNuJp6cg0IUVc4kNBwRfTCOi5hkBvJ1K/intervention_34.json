He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter, and after multiple failed attempts to communicate, the author staged a situation where she left the baby in his room and recorded him ignoring her. Then she sent that video to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend is not fulfilling his parental duties, the author has tried talking to him multiple times without success, and the situation is causing her significant stress. The action taken was to document the neglect by recording him when she wasn't actually leaving the house but pretended to, then showed the evidence to his mother.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, manipulating the situation by staging the scenario (leaving the baby and pretending to leave) could be seen as deceptive. Also, involving his mother without consulting him might breach trust in the relationship. But on the other hand, the author's primary concern is the well-being of her child. If the father is repeatedly neglecting the baby, that's a serious issue. The mother is in a difficult position, dealing with postpartum stress and inadequate support. She might have felt desperate and felt that involving the mother-in-law was necessary to get through to her partner.\n\nEthically, the mother's actions are aimed at protecting her child, which is a strong justification. However, the method might be questionable. Staging the situation could be considered manipulative, and sending the video without context might be misleading if the video cuts out important parts. Also, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as overstepping, especially in some family dynamics.\n\nBut considering the context: the boyfriend's behavior is consistent and harmful. The author has given multiple chances. The video was a direct example of neglect. While it's a privacy issue, the stakes here are high\u2014child welfare. In such cases, some might argue that the ends justify the means, especially if other methods have failed.\n\nSo, weighing the options. The author's actions were driven by the need to ensure the child's safety and to motivate her partner to change. While the method might be ethically ambiguous, the underlying issue is serious. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong, making the answer B.\n"
