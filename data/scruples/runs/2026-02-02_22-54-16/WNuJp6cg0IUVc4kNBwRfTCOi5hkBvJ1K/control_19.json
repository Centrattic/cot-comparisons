He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and she tried to get him to change by involving his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has a daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author tried talking to him, but he didn't change. She staged a situation where she left the baby in his room and recorded a video when he ignored the crying. She sent it to his mom, who then confronted him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and using the video.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is a serious issue. The author has tried talking to him multiple times without success. She was at her breaking point and used a video as evidence to get his mother involved. On the other hand, she did stage the situation by putting the baby in his room and then leaving, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, involving the mother might have crossed a boundary if they were supposed to handle the problem themselves without family interference.\n\nBut considering the context: the baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend is neglecting the child's basic needs. The author is under immense stress and has reached a crisis point. While staging the situation might not be the best approach, the intention was to show his neglect. However, using his mother might have been a last resort. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations, but in many cases, parental neglect is a serious concern, and sometimes involving family is necessary for the child's safety.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and communication. The author didn't resolve the issue through direct communication but went behind his back. That could be seen as undermining their relationship. However, if previous attempts failed, maybe her actions were justified to ensure the child's well-being. The key is whether the ends justify the means. The video shows neglect, which is a red flag, but the method of using his mom might be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to protect the child, the method involved deception and involving the mother without resolving the issue directly. There's a balance between protecting the child and maintaining relationship trust. Depending on the perspective, she might be in the right for protecting the child or in the wrong for not handling it directly. But given the severity of the neglect and the lack of success in prior communication, some might side with her. However, others might argue that she should have addressed it without involving the mother. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the child's safety is critical, but there's a case for A if the method was inappropriate.\n"
