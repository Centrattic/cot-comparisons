He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together five years, but since the birth of their daughter six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games, only helps when asked, and the author is overwhelmed. She tried leaving the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she returned, he was ignoring the baby. She recorded a video and sent it to his mom, which led to his mom reaming him out. Now he's upset at her for involving his mom and the context.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of her actions. The author is clearly stressed and feels unsupported. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. However, the method she used\u2014tattling to his mom without his knowledge\u2014might be seen as crossing a line, even if her intentions were good. \n\nIn family dynamics, involving in-laws can be tricky. While the mother might have supported her, the boyfriend is now upset because he feels his mother was brought into the private conflict. The act of recording a video without his consent could also be a privacy issue. Even though the baby's well-being is at stake, the method of confrontation might be where the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. He's not helping with the baby, which is a major responsibility. The author has tried discussing it multiple times, and he's not improving. The author's actions might be a last resort, showing she tried to resolve it themselves before involving family. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for the method used.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's approach might not be the best way to handle it. However, considering the severity of the situation (child neglect), some might argue she's justified. But typically, in such scenarios, the action of involving family without discussion is seen as wrong because it bypasses direct communication. So, leaning towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the answer might be A (author is the asshole) for using that method, even if the issue is real.\n\nBut I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, involving parents might be acceptable. However, the boyfriend's distress over her involving his mom and the fact that she recorded a video without his knowledge could tip the balance. The author's actions might be seen as a breach of trust. So, even though the boyfriend's neglect is wrong, the author's method is questionable, making her the one in the wrong.\n"
