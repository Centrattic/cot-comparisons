He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, leading the author to send a video to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend refuses to care for the baby, only does so when prompted, and the author is struggling. They've tried talking it out multiple times, but the behavior persists. The author then stages a situation by putting the baby in his gaming room, pretends to leave, and records a video of him ignoring the baby. She sends this to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with a significant issue\u2014her partner isn't supporting her with the baby, which is causing her stress and considering divorce. Her actions might be driven by desperation. But did she cross a line? She tricked her partner by pretending to leave, which could be seen as deceptive. Also, sending the video to his mother without his knowledge might be considered an invasion of privacy or meddling. The boyfriend argues the video was taken out of context, which the author didn't address.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law intervened and reamed him, which might be seen as helping the situation. However, the method used by the author\u2014staging a scenario and using a hidden video\u2014could be ethically questionable. Even if her intentions were good, the approach might be manipulative. She could have handled it differently, like involving a professional mediator or legal steps instead of using his mother.\n\nBut considering the context of parental neglect, which is a serious issue, maybe there's some leniency. However, the method of tattling and deception might still be wrong. The key here is whether her actions were justified given the situation. While the neglect is a problem, the way she addressed it could be seen as overstepping, especially without discussing it directly with her partner first. Involving the mother without the partner's consent might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nSo, weighing the options, the author's actions, while coming from a place of needing help, might be considered wrong because of the deceptive tactics and involving the mother without proper consideration. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Maybe some would argue that the neglect justifies the means. But in terms of relationship dynamics and ethical behavior, the method used could be problematic. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
