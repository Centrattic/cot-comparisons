He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video of their boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, especially when she's crying. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he keeps going back to his old habits. In a moment of desperation, she puts the baby in his room, leaves to get gas, and records a 10-second video of him ignoring the baby. Then she sends it to his mom, who confronts him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me consider the possible angles. On one hand, involving his mother might be seen as meddling or not handling the issue directly between the couple. However, the key point here is the child's well-being. The boyfriend is neglecting a crying infant, which is a serious matter. The author has tried every approach she can think of without success. The video was a last resort to get his mother to intervene because he wasn't responding otherwise.\n\nBut wait, what are the ethical implications of sharing private moments? The video was of a sensitive situation, but it was done to highlight neglect. Also, the mother-in-law's reaction could be protective, but the child's needs are paramount. The author is exhausted and at her breaking point.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the action was taken out of desperation to protect the child. While it might not be the ideal solution, the priority here is the child's welfare. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
