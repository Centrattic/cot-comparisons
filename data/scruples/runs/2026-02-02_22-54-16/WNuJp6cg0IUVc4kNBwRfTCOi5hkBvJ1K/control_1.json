He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for sending a video to their boyfriend's mom showing him ignoring their crying daughter. The situation is that the boyfriend won't help take care of the baby, plays video games, and the user is at her breaking point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been together five years and has a daughter who's six months old. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parenting duties, which is causing major stress on the user. They've tried talking about it, and he temporarily improves but then goes back to the same behavior. The user's action was to put the baby in his room, fake leaving, then take a video when he ignored her cries and sent it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, the user is overwhelmed, she tried a drastic measure to get his attention, which backfired. Now the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom one side, the user is justified in being frustrated. Parenting is hard, especially when one parent isn't contributing, leading to exhaustion. The act of not responding to a child's cries is concerning. The video was taken as evidence to show his mother, which led to the mom confronting him. The boyfriend is upset about being tattled on, so maybe there's a privacy or trust issue here.\n\nBut then, the method the user used involved deception (pretending to leave) and involving the mother, which might be seen as crossing a line. In some cultures, involving in-laws can be problematic, especially without the spouse's consent. The boyfriend's reaction is understandable if he felt betrayed. However, the user's intent was to make him take responsibility, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe boyfriend's consistent refusal to help despite discussions is a red flag. Maybe the user tried all avenues and this was a last resort. But is sending a video to his mom the right approach? It could be seen as manipulative, even if the intent was good. On the other hand, if the mother was part of the solution and the boyfriend's behavior is harmful, the user might be trying to get support.\n\nI need to check if there's a consensus on whether involving in-laws in such a way is acceptable. In AITA scenarios, often the person is considered in the wrong if they involve family in a private matter without consent. But the user's situation is extreme\u2014her child's well-being is at stake. The video is a direct example of neglect, so maybe the mother had a right to know to intervene.\n\nBut the problem is the method: fake leaving, taking a video without his knowledge. That could be considered a privacy violation. However, if the child is in danger, some might argue that the ends justify the means. The boyfriend's behavior might be considered neglectful, but unless it's actual harm, it's a parenting style issue.\n\nThe mother's reaction might have been harsh, but the user's action was to protect the child. The boyfriend is upset about being tattled on, but maybe that's because he's aware his behavior is wrong. The user is considering divorce, which shows the situation is severe.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The user's actions were extreme but driven by desperation and a need to protect the child. However, the method of involving his mother without his consent and using a video might be seen as overstepping. But if the mother's intervention is leading to positive change, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. It depends on the cultural context and the severity of the neglect. Since the user is in a crisis, some might say she's not in the wrong. Others might say she should have handled it differently. I think the answer leans towards B (No), because the mother's well-being of the child is a priority, and involving the mother to address neglect is a reasonable step when all else fails.\n"
