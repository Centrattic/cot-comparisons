He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sending a video to their boyfriend's mom. The boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter, and this has been going on for a while. The couple has been together five years, and since the baby was born six months ago, things have gotten worse. The boyfriend plays video games, ignores the baby unless the person tells him to, and when the baby cries, he doesn't help. They've talked about it, but he keeps going back to his old behavior.\n\nSo the person decided to put the baby in his gaming room and leave, then came back to find the baby crying while he played games. They took a video and sent it to his mom, explaining the situation. The mom called him out, and now the boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and took the video out of context. The person is considering divorce but is wondering if they're in the wrong for tattling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of support with childcare. The person is clearly overwhelmed and has tried to communicate multiple times. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility, which is a big problem, especially with a newborn. The person is trying to protect their child and is at their breaking point.\n\nThe action taken was sending a video evidence to his mom. This could be seen as a way to get help from his family, which might be necessary if the boyfriend isn't responding to direct communication. However, involving the mother might have been a breach of trust between the couple. The boyfriend might feel that the person didn't handle it within their relationship first. But given the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting a crying baby\u2014some might argue it's justified.\n\nThe person could be in the wrong if they bypassed their partner and went directly to his mom without trying every possible solution. However, considering the repeated attempts and the baby's well-being, others might see it as a necessary step. The key factors here are the boyfriend's consistent neglect and the person's desperation. The video as evidence might be seen as a way to show the reality of the situation, which his mom could understand better.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and communication. By not discussing it further with her partner and instead involving his mother, it could be seen as undermining their relationship. However, if he's not responsive, the person might feel they have no other options. The question is whether the action was a justified step to protect their child or an overreach that breaches the relationship's boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent was to protect the child and possibly get support from the boyfriend's family. The consequences are making the boyfriend upset, but the core issue is his neglect. The person might not be in the wrong because the child's safety and well-being are paramount. However, the method of addressing it might be a point of contention. But overall, the person's actions seem to stem from a place of desperation and trying to resolve the situation, which could mean they're not in the wrong.\n"
