He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. The situation is pretty intense. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple discussions and even the author considering divorce. She staged a scenario where she left, the baby was left crying, and then she sent a video to his mom to make him take responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The primary concern is the baby's well-being. If the father is neglecting the child, that's a serious issue. The mother is trying to get him to step up, and when communication isn't working, she takes a drastic step. Sending the video to his mother could be seen as a last resort to make him realize the severity, but it's also involving family, which can be sensitive.\n\nCulturally, tattling might be viewed negatively, but when it's about a child's welfare, the stakes are higher. The mother might feel that the father isn't taking the problem seriously, so she escalated it. However, the father might see this as a breach of trust. The mother's actions could be seen as justified if there's a genuine risk to the child, but the method (using a setup) is tricky. Was she deceptive by leaving the baby in his care? That could be seen as manipulative, but the intention was to document neglect.\n\nLegal and ethical boundaries are important here. In some places, neglect is a legal issue, but the mother didn't report it to authorities, choosing a family route instead. That might be more about trying to resolve it within the family first. However, the mother might argue she had no choice after multiple failed attempts.\n\nThe father's reaction is also relevant. If he's now upset about the video, but the video was a factual record of a neglectful act, his anger might be misplaced. The mother's frustration is understandable, given the ongoing stress and lack of support. The question is whether using a video to confront the mother-in-law was the right approach. There's a line between justified action and overstepping, especially in family dynamics.\n\nIn many cases, people might empathize with the mother, seeing her as trying to protect her child. However, some might criticize her for not going to the proper authorities or for using a setup. The key is whether the action was proportionate. Since the baby's safety was at risk and the father wasn't responding to other methods, the mother's action might be seen as a necessary step, even if ethically questionable in terms of privacy and family involvement.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as her primary concern is the child's well-being and she tried all other avenues first. The setup might be ethically gray, but the intent was to address neglect, which is a serious issue.\n"
