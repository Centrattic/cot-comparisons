He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years and had a daughter six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, mostly gaming and ignoring her when she cries. They've talked about it multiple times, and he improves temporarily but then goes back to the old behavior. The author tried a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving, then returning to find him ignoring the crying baby again. She recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, explaining the situation. The mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being \"out of context.\"\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's dealing with a partner who isn't fulfilling his parental duties, leading to exhaustion and considering divorce. Her actions were to get his mom involved after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. She recorded the incident to show the reality of the situation. The boyfriend is upset about the video being shared and the context being questioned. \n\nI need to consider if her actions were justified. She tried to resolve the issue directly but failed. Using the video as evidence might be seen as necessary to convince his mom to intervene. However, involving family can be sensitive. Did she overstep by sharing the video without his consent? Maybe, but given the circumstances, she might feel it's necessary for the baby's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel her action was a breach of privacy or manipulation. But the core issue is his lack of parental responsibility. The author is trying to protect the child and herself from ongoing neglect. \n\nI think the author's intent was to address a serious issue (child neglect) after exhausting other options. While involving the mother might be seen as a step too far, the underlying problem is significant. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because the video was a last resort to highlight a critical issue. Answer B.\n"
