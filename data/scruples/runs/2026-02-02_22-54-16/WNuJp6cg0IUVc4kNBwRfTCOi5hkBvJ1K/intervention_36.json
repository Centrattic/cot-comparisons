He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He's playing games, ignoring the baby's cries, only helping when the mother asks. They've discussed it multiple times, and he seems to improve briefly but then goes back. The mother, feeling desperate, stages a situation where she leaves the baby with him, pretends to leave, then records him ignoring the baby and sends it to his mom. The boyfriend is upset she involved his mom and took the video.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mother is trying to address a serious issue\u2014child neglect. The father's behavior is harmful, and she's exhausted. Using the video as evidence to involve his mother might be a way to hold him accountable, especially if direct communication isn't working. Her action could be seen as a last resort to protect the child.\n\nOn the other hand, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Privacy is a concern here; recording him might be considered deceptive or violating trust. Also, using a parent to mediate adult issues might not be the best approach, as it could cause family tension. The method she used (staging the situation) is manipulative, which could be seen as underhanded.\n\nBut considering the context of a parent's responsibility and the well-being of the child, her actions might be justified. The key is whether the ends (protecting the child) justify the means (deception and involving family). In child neglect cases, taking drastic measures can be understandable, even if the method is questionable.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives differ. Legally, if the child is in danger, reporting to authorities is appropriate, but involving family isn't. Ethically, it's a gray area. Her intent was to help the child, but the method involved deception and possibly overstepping.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the answer is B (No), it's because her intent was to protect the child. If A (Yes), because the method was manipulative and violated trust. Given the severity of the neglect, the answer leans towards B. However, there's room for debate on the approach.\n"
