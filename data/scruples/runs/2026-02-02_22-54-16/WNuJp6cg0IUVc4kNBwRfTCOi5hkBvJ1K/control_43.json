He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend's mom about his behavior towards their baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He ignores the baby's crying unless the author tells him to, and even then, he asks why she can't do it. He stays up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby wakes up. They've discussed this multiple times, and he temporarily improves but then relapses.\n\nThe author tried a \"last ditch effort\" by putting the baby in his gaming room and leaving to the gas station. When she comes back, the baby is screaming and he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom with an explanation. His mom calls him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video \"out of context.\" The author is considering divorce but is now wondering if she's wrong for contacting his mom.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she did the right thing by involving the mother. The possible angles here are about privacy, communication, and the well-being of the child. \n\nOn one hand, the author is clearly frustrated and feels like she's the only one handling the baby's needs. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, which is causing her significant stress. She's tried talking to him, but it hasn't worked. Involving his mother might be a way to make him more accountable, especially if he's not responsive to her own requests.\n\nOn the other hand, involving a parent in a spouse's personal issues can be seen as overstepping boundaries. Marital problems are typically considered a matter between the couple. By sharing the video with his mother, the author might have breached confidentiality or trust, which could explain why the boyfriend is upset. The act of recording the video might be seen as manipulative or an invasion of privacy, depending on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the key factor here is the safety and well-being of the baby. If the father is neglecting the child, that's a serious issue. The author might feel that she's at her breaking point and that the child is suffering because of the father's inaction. In some cases, involving family might be necessary if the person is not responsive. But the method used\u2014recording a video without informing him\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe ethical dilemma is between protecting the child and maintaining marital privacy. If the father is truly neglecting the child, then the mother-in-law's intervention might be justified. However, the way it was done could have been handled differently, like involving child protective services or legal authorities instead of the mother. \n\nBut in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer depends on societal norms and how the situation is perceived. In some cultures, involving family is common and acceptable, while in others, it's seen as a breach of marital autonomy.\n\nGiven that the author has tried multiple times to address the issue directly with her partner without success, and the child's well-being is at risk, her actions might be seen as a last resort. However, the method of involving his mother without consulting him first might be considered crossing a line, hence making her the \"asshole\" in the situation. Alternatively, if the neglect is severe, her actions could be justified.\n\nBut the key here is that she took a video secretly and sent it to his mother. That could be seen as underhanded. Even if her intentions were good, the approach might have been wrong. The boyfriend's reaction could be based on feeling disrespected or betrayed, which is a valid reaction. However, the fact that he's not helping the baby is also a problem. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person is considered the asshole if they make a decision without considering the other person's perspective or if they violate trust. Here, she violated the trust by involving his mother and recording secretly. Even if her intent was to help the situation, the method might be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong). But if the neglect is severe and immediate, maybe not. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not whether the boyfriend is negligent. \n\nSo, the answer likely depends on whether the act of involving his mother was justified. Since she didn't go through proper channels (like legal or authorities) and instead went to his mother, which is more of a personal approach, she might be seen as in the wrong for not handling it through appropriate means. Alternatively, if the mother's intervention was effective, maybe not. But the AITA community often looks at actions and intentions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic, the author's method of addressing it might be considered overstepping, making her the asshole here. So the answer would be A.\n"
