He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for tattling on their boyfriend to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after multiple attempts to talk about it, the author sends a video to his mom. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together five years, married with a six-month-old. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing the author a lot of stress. They've talked about it multiple times, and the boyfriend has temporary improvements but then goes back. The author felt desperate and used a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving to get a video. Then sent that video to his mom, leading to her confronting him. Now the author is blamed for tattling.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is acting out of concern for the baby's well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, and the author has tried to address it without success. Using the video as evidence to get the mother involved might be a way to hold the boyfriend accountable. However, the method of sending the video to his mom could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially if the boyfriend didn't want his mom involved. The author might have acted impulsively or without considering the impact on their relationship dynamics. \n\nBut considering the severity of the issue\u2014neglect of a child\u2014it's a serious matter. The author might feel justified in taking that step to protect the child. In some contexts, involving family could be seen as a last resort when other methods have failed. However, it's important that the author didn't try all possible solutions first. Maybe there's a lack of communication or professional help sought. But given the situation described, the author's actions might be understandable. The key points are the neglect, the repeated failure to address it, and the author's desperation leading to the video. \n\nThe question is whether sending the video was the wrong action. If the mother's intervention actually helped, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, using a video to \"tattle\" might have been a breach of trust, depending on how it was done. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, even if the author had good intentions. But considering the child's welfare, the action is more about protecting the child than just tattling. \n\nSo, the answer depends on weighing the child's well-being against the method used. If the method was inappropriate, then maybe A. But if the intent was to help the child and the boyfriend wasn't responsive, then B. The community might split, but given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong. Hence, B.\n"
