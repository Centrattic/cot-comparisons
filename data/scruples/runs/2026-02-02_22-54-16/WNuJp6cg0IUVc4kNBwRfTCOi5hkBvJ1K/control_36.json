He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that her boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter, ignoring her cries, and only taking care of her when she's calm and watching. She tried talking to him multiple times, even went as far as leaving the baby in his room and going out, then sent a video of him ignoring the baby to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is the well-being of her child and the stress in their relationship. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is causing significant strain. She tried to address it before, but he keeps going back to not helping. The video was a last resort to get her mother-in-law to intervene.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The boyfriend might feel that she didn't trust him enough to handle the situation themselves. The act of taking a video could be seen as manipulative or using evidence in a context he finds unfair. However, the main issue is the neglect of the baby's needs. Sending the video might have been necessary to get the mother to intervene, especially if her own attempts to communicate with her partner failed.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the well-being of the child is the priority. If the boyfriend is not fulfilling his duties, the mother has a right to ensure the child's needs are met. However, the method of involving the mother might have been problematic. Maybe there are other ways to handle this, like seeking professional help or legal advice, but in her situation, she felt it was necessary to take that step to protect the baby.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the video accurately showed neglect, then she's acting in the child's best interest. But did she have the right to involve his mother without his consent? That's a gray area. In some cultures, involving extended family is common, but in others, it might be seen as overstepping. However, the key here is the health and safety of the child. If the boyfriend is being neglectful, the mother has a responsibility to act, even if it means involving others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because she's acting in the baby's best interest despite the method. However, the way she handled it might not be the ideal approach, but given the circumstances, she's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
