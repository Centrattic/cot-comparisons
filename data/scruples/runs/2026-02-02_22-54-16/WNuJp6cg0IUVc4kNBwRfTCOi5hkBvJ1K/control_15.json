He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. So the situation is that the couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays games instead, only helps when told, and there's this incident where the author left the baby with him and took a video of him ignoring the crying baby. Then she sent that to his mom, leading to his mom scolding him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been trying to talk to her boyfriend about his lack of involvement, but he's not changing. He's not taking care of the baby, she's getting exhausted, and it's affecting their marriage. She's at her breaking point. She took the baby to his gaming room, left, and came back to him ignoring the baby. She made a video and sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's trying to protect the baby and get her partner to take responsibility. She's tried talking, even threatening to leave, but he's not changing. Her actions are a last resort. She might feel she has no other options left.\n\nBut from the boyfriend's side, he might feel that she shouldn't have involved his mom without his consent. He might see the video as a trap or a setup. Even if he's being negligent, the way she exposed it to his mother could be seen as crossing a line. Family dynamics can be sensitive, and involving parents can be a big deal in some cultures or relationships.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties. 2) The author has tried communication and is exhausted. 3) She took a video as evidence and shared it with his mom, which led to conflict. 4) The question is whether her actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, ensuring the child's well-being is crucial. If the father is neglecting the baby, the mother has a duty to protect the child. On the other hand, involving family without consent might be seen as overstepping. However, given the situation is a domestic partnership and the child is involved, the mother's primary concern is the child's welfare, which could outweigh the method of involving the mother-in-law.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust and how the video was taken. If she set up the situation (putting the baby there knowing he'd ignore her), that could be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend might argue that the video is out of context, even if it shows him not helping. However, if the video accurately captures him ignoring a crying baby, that's a serious issue regardless of context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The author's intention was to protect the child and force her partner to take responsibility, which is understandable. However, the method of involving his mother could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if they had not discussed this approach beforehand. In some cultures, involving the mother is a common way to address issues, but in others, it's considered a privacy violation.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. However, from a neutral standpoint, while the author's actions were driven by concern for the child, using a video and involving the mother-in-law without her partner's consent might be considered a mistake. The boyfriend has a right to privacy, and even if he's negligent, the method of exposing it could be seen as wrong. Alternatively, the child's safety is paramount, and the mother might have done what she had to do.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then her method was wrong despite the intent. If B (no), then her intent to protect the child justifies her actions. I think it's a bit of both, but the question is whether she's \"in the wrong.\" In many cases, people might side with her because the child's well-being is critical. However, the act of using a video and involving the mother could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it was a setup. But if it's a genuine situation where the baby was crying and he didn't help, then it's a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is B (no), because her actions were driven by necessity to protect the child, even if the method was questionable. However, others might say A (yes) because she didn't communicate her plan to involve his mom and used the video as evidence without his knowledge. It's a tough call, but I think in this scenario, the author's actions are not in the wrong because the child's safety is the priority, and she's exhausted other options. So the answer would be B.\n"
