He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author, the girlfriend, is really frustrated and tried to get him to help by putting the baby in his room and then leaving. She took a video when he ignored the baby and sent it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset, and the author is considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend isn't participating in childcare, which is causing major stress. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he doesn't change. She takes a video as evidence and sends it to his mom. The mom then confronts the boyfriend, who's now angry at the author for involving his mother and the video.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the dynamics here. The author is in a stressful situation with a newborn. The boyfriend's lack of support is leading to exhaustion and potential family breakdown. The author tried various steps: talking, threatening to leave, and finally involving the mother-in-law. The act of sending a video might be seen as a form of evidence to show the mother-in-law the issue. However, involving the mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if the couple had not resolved their issues internally first. \n\nIn many cases, involving family without consulting the partner can be seen as a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's mother might have helped, but it could have been done differently. The author's actions might be justified given the severity of the situation, but the method could be questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to get help, and the video serves as proof. However, the approach of using a video and sending it to his mother might be seen as an escalation that bypassed direct communication between the couple. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent and the method. The intent was to protect the baby and address the boyfriend's negligence. The method involved surveillance and involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent. While the mother's intervention did have an effect, it's unclear if this is a sustainable solution. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a balance. The author's frustration is understandable, but using a video might be seen as a privacy invasion. However, considering the well-being of the child, some might argue it's justified. \n\nIn many relationships, resolving conflicts without third-party involvement is ideal. But when one partner is neglecting responsibilities, especially with a child's welfare at stake, the urgency might override typical relationship norms. \n\nSo, the answer could be a bit nuanced. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the situation is dire and the boyfriend's behavior is harmful. However, there's a question of whether she should have handled it differently, like involving another authority or seeking counseling first. \n\nBut given the options, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The act of sending the video could be seen as a necessary step to protect the child and herself, even if it's unconventional. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that she should have tried other methods first, making her at least partially at fault. But the primary issue is the boyfriend's neglect, so the author's actions are a response to that.\n"
