He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple discussions. The author, frustrated, stages a test by leaving the baby with him and then records him ignoring the baby when it starts crying. She sends the video to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's behavior is definitely problematic. Not helping with childcare, especially when the mother is struggling, is a serious issue. The author tried to resolve it through communication, but he didn't change. That shows she made reasonable attempts before escalating.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's actions were justified. She didn't just tattle for no reason; she had a valid concern for the baby's well-being. However, using a staged situation might be seen as manipulative. But given the circumstances, she was trying to prove her point. Sending it to his mom could be seen as a last resort to get help, but it's also invading privacy and involving family, which can complicate things.\n\nOn one hand, protecting the child is a priority. On the other, the method might be questionable. But considering the boyfriend's negligence and the failure of communication, the author's actions were a desperate but understandable measure. She's in a tough spot, and her main goal is the baby's welfare. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
