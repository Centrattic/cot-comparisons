He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is at fault for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games while the baby cries, only helps when prompted, and doesn't hold her unless she's calm. They've talked about it, but he keeps reverting. The author tried a \"last ditch effort\" by putting the baby in the gaming room and leaving, then coming back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, leading to her being reamed out and the man being upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the ethical aspects. On one hand, the mother is trying to protect her child's well-being by exposing her partner's neglect. The father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. Sending the video to his mother might be an attempt to make him take responsibility, especially after multiple failed attempts to communicate.\n\nOn the other hand, involving family without discussing it first could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend might feel that she's overstepping by using his mother to confront him. However, the mother's actions are driven by desperation and the need to ensure her child's needs are met. The father's behavior is harmful, and the mother's action could be a necessary step to protect the child.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the well-being of the child is paramount. If the father isn't contributing to care, the mother has a right to seek help. The method of involving his mother might be unorthodox, but the intent is to address neglect. The father's reaction to being reamed by his mother might also reflect poorly on him, indicating that he's aware of his wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering the options, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's acting in the child's best interest, even if the approach is controversial. The father's neglect is the core issue here, and the mother's actions are a response to an ongoing problem.\n"
