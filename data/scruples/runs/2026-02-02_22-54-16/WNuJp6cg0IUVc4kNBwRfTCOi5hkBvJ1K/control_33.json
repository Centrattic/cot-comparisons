He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their baby, and she took a video when she left him in charge, then sent it to his mom. The boyfriend is now upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend's refusal to help with the baby, leading to exhaustion and stress for the author. She tried talking to him, but he kept reverting to his old habits. Her last attempt was leaving the baby with him and then sending a video to his mom. The question is whether she overstepped by involving his mother.\n\nOn one hand, she's in a difficult situation. The baby's well-being is a priority, and if the father isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, someone might need to step in. By sending the video, she provided evidence that the mom could use to confront the son. The mother did ream him out, which might have been effective in making him face his actions. The author's intent was to protect the baby and get help, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships are built on mutual respect, and taking actions without discussing them with the partner might damage the relationship further. The boyfriend might feel that his privacy was invaded by sending the video, especially if it was out of context. Also, using a parent to intervene could create tension in the family dynamics, which isn't ideal.\n\nBut considering the circumstances\u2014exhaustion, the baby's needs not being met, and repeated failed attempts to communicate\u2014it's a desperate move. The author might feel she's out of options. The act of sending the video was a direct way to show his mother what's happening, which could be justified if the mother was in a position to influence his behavior. However, the method might be questionable.\n\nI need to balance the intent (protecting the child and seeking help) against the method (without consulting him, involving his family). The answer might depend on cultural factors too. Some might see it as justified, others as overstepping. But given the severity of the issue (child neglect), the author's actions could be seen as necessary. Still, the way she handled it (without trying all possible solutions first, maybe) could be seen as a mistake.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and the proportionality of the action. If the author's intention was to get help for the baby and she was at her wit's end, it might not be her fault. But if there were other options she didn't explore, that could make her at fault. However, the post states she tried talking multiple times and even considered divorce, so maybe she's run out of options.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the child's well-being is a critical factor, and she took action to ensure the child's needs were met. However, the method of involving his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach. But given the context, the community might side with her as she's trying to protect the child and herself.\n"
