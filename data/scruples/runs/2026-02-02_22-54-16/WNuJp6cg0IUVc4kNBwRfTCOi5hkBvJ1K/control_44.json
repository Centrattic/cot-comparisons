He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a newborn, where the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author sent a video to his mom showing him not taking care of the baby, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, and the mother is overwhelmed. They've had discussions about this, and he's made temporary improvements but then relapsed. The author felt desperate and tried using the gas station trick to test him, which backfired. She sent the video to his mom, which led to his mother confronting him. Now the boyfriend is upset, thinking the video was taken out of context.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, involving the mother-in-law is a sensitive move. While the situation is serious, bypassing the boyfriend and going straight to his mom could be seen as overstepping. However, the mother is in a stressful situation with a newborn, and the father isn't helping, which is a valid concern. The act of tattling is questionable because it might undermine their relationship. But the core issue is about parental responsibility and the mother's well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the mother is acting out of desperation. While the method of confronting the mother-in-law might not be the best approach, the underlying issue is valid. So, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the situation justifies her actions, even if the approach could be better. However, some might argue that AITA depends on the method rather than the intent. Still, given the context of the father's neglect and the mother's attempts to resolve it, sending the video as evidence to his mother might be a last resort, making the answer B.\n"
