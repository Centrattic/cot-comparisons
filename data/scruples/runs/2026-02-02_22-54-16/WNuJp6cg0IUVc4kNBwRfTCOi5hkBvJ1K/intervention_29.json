He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author is overwhelmed, has tried talking to him multiple times, and even staged a situation to confront him. She recorded a video when she returned from the gas station to show the baby being ignored. Then she sent it to his mom, which led to her being blamed for \"tattling.\"\n\nSo, the core issues here are: 1) The boyfriend's lack of parental responsibility, 2) The author's attempts to address it without success, 3) The use of a video to show the situation to his mother.\n\nI need to determine if her actions were justified. The author is clearly in a stressful, parenting situation where she's not getting the support she needs. She's made multiple attempts to resolve the issue directly but without success. The video was a last resort to show evidence of her claims when he was ignoring the baby. \n\nHowever, involving the mother might be seen as overstepping, depending on their relationship dynamics. But given the context\u2014childcare neglect and the author's exhaustion\u2014her actions could be seen as necessary to protect the child and her own well-being. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about being embarrassed than the child's welfare. The mother's response was to confront him, which might indicate that the issue was known or could be addressed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's primary concern is the well-being of the child and her own mental health. Sending the video as evidence could be seen as a justified action when words aren't working. However, some might argue she should have involved other supports first, like counseling or legal steps. But given the circumstances, her actions seem reasonable. \n\nSo, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). The key is the intent: she's trying to ensure the child's needs are met and her own capacity isn't overwhelmed. The method might be harsh, but the underlying reasons are valid.\n"
