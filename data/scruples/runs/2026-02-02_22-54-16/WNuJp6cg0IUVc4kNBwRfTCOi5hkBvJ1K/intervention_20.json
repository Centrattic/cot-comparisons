He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points are that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple discussions. The author, feeling overwhelmed, leaves the baby in the room with the boyfriend, then goes to the gas station, comes back to find the baby crying and him ignoring it. She takes a short video and sends it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful, especially since the situation has been ongoing for six months and discussions haven't resolved it. The author's actions are a last attempt to get help. Sending the video to his mother might be seen as involving family, which can be a sensitive topic. But the mother did confront her son, which might have been necessary given the neglect.\n\nIs the author at fault for tattling? The term \"tattling\" usually implies a negative connotation, like reporting someone without good reason. Here, the author is trying to protect her child and address a serious issue. The video was taken as evidence of neglect, which is a valid concern for a child's welfare. However, involving the mother might have been a breach of privacy or trust between the couple. The boyfriend might feel that his partner didn't trust him enough to handle the situation without external intervention. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was at her wits' end, suggesting that prior communication attempts failed. The video served as proof of the problem, leading to the mother taking action. The boyfriend's reaction being upset about being reported and the video's context might be his way of deflecting responsibility. \n\nConsidering all factors, the mother's role in reaming him out could push him to change his behavior. The author's actions were driven by a need to protect her child and seek support after exhausting other options. While involving the mother might not be ideal, the severity of the neglect (a child left to cry) justifies the action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
