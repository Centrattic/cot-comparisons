He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with their baby, and the author sending a video to his mom after he ignored the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend is neglecting his responsibilities as a parent, only helping when prompted, and not taking care of the baby when she cries. The author tried multiple times to address this issue without success. She felt desperate and even considered divorce. In a moment of frustration, she sent a video to his mother to make him realize the problem, but now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe main question is whether her actions were justified. On one hand, the author had a legitimate concern about the baby's well-being and the boyfriend's inaction. She tried to communicate with him but didn't get results. The video was a direct evidence of his neglect. On the other hand, involving his mother might have been a breach of trust, and using a video without context could be seen as manipulative. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014child neglect\u2014the author's intent was to protect the baby.\n\nDifferent perspectives: Some might say she overstepped by involving his mother, but others might argue that the baby's welfare is the priority and she did what was necessary. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, but the author's method of addressing it could be questioned. However, given the circumstances, it's a tough spot. The answer depends on whether the action was a reasonable response to a serious issue. I think the author isn't in the wrong because she's protecting the child's well-being, even if the method was a bit extreme. So the answer would be B.\n"
