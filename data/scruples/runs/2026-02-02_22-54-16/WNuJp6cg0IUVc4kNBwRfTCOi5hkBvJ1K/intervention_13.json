He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter. The author tried multiple times to talk to him, and he temporarily improves but goes back to ignoring the baby. In a moment of frustration, she puts the baby in his gaming room, leaves, takes a video of him ignoring the baby when she cries, and sends it to his mom. The boyfriend is now upset, and she's considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions cross a line. From her perspective, she's dealing with a significant stressor\u2014newborn care\u2014and her partner isn't contributing. She's tried communication, but it's not working. The video was a last resort to show his mother the reality of the situation. However, tattling to his mom might be seen as overstepping, especially if she didn't have his consent. But his actions (ignoring the baby) are harmful, so the mother might not have known the full extent. \n\nOn the other hand, manipulating the situation by putting the baby in his room to provoke a reaction could be seen as deceptive. She's creating a scenario to capture evidence, which might not be entirely ethical. But considering the context of parental neglect, many might empathize with her desperation. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties. 2) She's exhausted and has tried all avenues. 3) The video was a means to an end to get his mother involved. 4) Her actions led to his mother confronting him, which might not have happened otherwise. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a gray area. But given the severity of the issue (abuse/neglect of a child), some might argue she's justified. Others might say she should have handled it differently. However, the act of sending the video without his knowledge could be problematic, but the intent was to protect the child. So, leaning towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
