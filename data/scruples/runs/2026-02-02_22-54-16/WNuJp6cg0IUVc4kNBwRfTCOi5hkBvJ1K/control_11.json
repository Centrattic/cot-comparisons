He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their baby and she's at her breaking point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't sharing the parenting duties. He's playing video games a lot and only helps when the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old ways. The author tried a last effort by leaving and recording a video of him ignoring the baby, then sending it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing by tattling. Let's break it down. The author's actions were meant to get help, but involving the mother might not be the best approach. However, she's under a lot of stress and feels alone. The boyfriend isn't responding to her requests, so she's trying to force a change. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a tough call. On one hand, the baby's well-being is crucial, and the father isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. By recording and showing the video, she's trying to protect the baby. On the other hand, involving the mother could be seen as manipulating the situation, even if the intent was good. Also, maybe they should have tried counseling or other interventions before involving family. \n\nBut considering the extreme stress of caring for a newborn alone and the boyfriend's lack of improvement despite multiple talks, the author might feel desperate. The act of sending the video could be a last resort to provoke change. However, there's a risk of misinterpretation, as the boyfriend says the video was out of context. The author might not have considered that angle. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The author's intention was to help the baby and herself, but the method might not have been the best. But given the circumstances, especially with a newborn and the boyfriend's consistent neglect, some might argue she's justified. Others might say she should have handled it differently without involving the mother. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether involving the mother was the right choice. If the mother was likely to take action and he needed to be held accountable, then maybe it's understandable. However, if it's seen as an overstep, then she's in the wrong. The key factors are the baby's welfare and the boyfriend's failure to help. In such high-stress situations, people might act out of desperation. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she's trying to protect her child, but there might be better ways. However, given the circumstances, I'm leaning towards B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
