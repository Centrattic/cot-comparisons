He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother about him not taking care of the baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, preferring to play video games. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't change his behavior. She tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving for a gas station. When she came back, he was ignoring the crying baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, which resulted in the mom scolding him. Now, the boyfriend is upset with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to evaluate if her actions were justified. The key points here are the neglect of the child, repeated attempts to address it, and the use of the video as evidence to involve his mother. \n\nThe author is in a stressful situation where the child's well-being is at stake. She's tried direct communication without success. Using the video as evidence to show his mother might be a way to get support or intervention. However, tattling could be seen as involving family unnecessarily. But considering the child's safety and the chronic neglect, her actions might be seen as desperate but justified. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the boyfriend isn't helping and the child is being neglected, maybe the mother-in-law's intervention is needed. Alternatively, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like involving child protective services or legal steps, but she's in a personal relationship and using family support. \n\nThe video is a short clip, and she provided context. The boyfriend's response is that the video is out of context, but if the situation was as described, the context is clear. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are likely not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
