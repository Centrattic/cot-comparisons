He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story did the wrong thing by sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together five years, and after having a daughter six months ago, the boyfriend isn't contributing to childcare. He plays video games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and only holds her when it's convenient. The author has tried talking to him, but he relapses into old habits. In a desperate move, she leaves the baby in his room, goes out, records a video when he ignores the baby, and sends it to his mom. The mom confronts him, he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video. Now the author is considering divorce and wants to know if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend's neglect, the author's attempts to resolve it, and her final action of involving his mother. The question is whether sending the video was wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical and emotional aspects. On one hand, the author is trying to protect her child and address a serious issue. Neglecting an infant is a serious matter, and she's under a lot of stress. On the other hand, involving his mother might be seen as overstepping, and the video could be taken out of context. But given the boyfriend's repeated refusal to help despite multiple discussions, the author's desperation makes sense. Sending it to his mom might be a way to get through to him, especially if he responds to his mother's intervention.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the boyfriend's behavior is clearly problematic. The author is trying to get help for her child. While involving the mother isn't the usual approach, given the circumstances, it might be justified. The answer likely hinges on the severity of the neglect and the author's intent to protect the child.\n\nIn many cases, people might criticize the method (like not talking to him first), but since she's already tried and failed, this could be seen as a last resort. The boyfriend's reaction might also be part of the problem\u2014being defensive instead of addressing the neglect.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She was acting in her child's best interest after exhausting other options. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
