He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a 6-month-old, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays video games while the baby cries, only helps when told, and then questions why the author can't do it. They've talked about it multiple times, but he relapses into old habits. The author tried leaving the baby in his room to see if he'd take care of her, then sent a video to his mom when she returned to find the baby crying and him ignoring her. The result was the boyfriend being upset and his mom reaming him out.\n\nSo, the author's actions were to document the situation and involve the mother-in-law. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is a parent whose partner isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. The baby's well-being is at stake. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue directly with her boyfriend without success. When she felt desperate, she used a video to show his mother, leading to a confrontation.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author have a right to involve the mother? Was the video an appropriate action? Could there be unintended consequences, like straining the relationship with the mother-in-law or the boyfriend? But on the other hand, ensuring the baby's needs are met is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue.\n\nThe author's intent was to highlight a problem that needed addressing. While involving the mother is a boundary that might not be ideal, the underlying issue is the boyfriend's neglect. The author's actions might be seen as a last resort after failed communication. However, some might argue that she shouldn't have gone to his mother, but others might see it as necessary to get through to him.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action of sending the video to the mother was justified given the circumstances. If the boyfriend is not helping, and the author is at her breaking point, her action could be seen as justified. The mother's involvement might have been a way to enforce accountability. However, there might be a better way to handle it, but the core issue is the neglect of the child. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
