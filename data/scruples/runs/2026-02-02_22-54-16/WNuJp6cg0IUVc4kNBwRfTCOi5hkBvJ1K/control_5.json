He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for tattling on her boyfriend to his mom. The main issue is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author sent a video to his mom after he ignored the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The couple has been together for five years, and after the birth of their daughter six months ago, the boyfriend refuses to help. He plays video games, only helps when told, and then questions why she can't do it herself. They've had multiple discussions, and he temporarily improves but then backslides. The author is frustrated and considering divorce. She staged a situation by leaving the baby in his room and then took a video of him ignoring her, sending it to his mom.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author is clearly stressed and struggling. On the other hand, she took a video in a staged situation, which could be seen as manipulative. The video might not show the full context. She also involved the mother, which could be crossing boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the intent. She was trying to show his mother the reality of the situation so he'd take responsibility. However, staging a scenario to capture evidence might not be the best approach. Even if her intentions were good, the method could be questionable. Also, using a video as proof might be seen as a privacy invasion. But the boyfriend's inaction is a serious problem, so maybe there's some justification.\n\nIn similar situations, parents often feel they have a right to intervene if they believe a child's well-being is at risk. The mother might have a point in calling him out. However, the author's method of staging the situation and using a video could be ethically problematic. It's a gray area. The answer might not be black and white. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the action of staging the video and tattling is considered inappropriate, then the answer would be A. If the action is justified given the boyfriend's neglect, then B. But in many cases, staging evidence is seen as wrong, even if the intent is good. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
