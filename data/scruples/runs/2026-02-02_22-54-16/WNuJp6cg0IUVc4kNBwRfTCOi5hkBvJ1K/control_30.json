He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him not taking care of their baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together five years, but since the daughter was born six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays games, ignores her cries unless told, and only holds her when calm. The author tried talking, even threatening to leave, and he temporarily improves but relapses. She put the baby in his room and left, came back to find him ignoring her again. She took a video and sent it to his mom, leading to her being upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's actions were to document the boyfriend's neglect and show it to his mother. The boyfriend's inaction is concerning, especially with a newborn. The mother's reaction was to confront him, which might have worked in the short term but caused marital strain.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she's documenting abuse or neglect of their child. Using a video to show the mother-in-law might be a way to get support. But involving the mother could be seen as undermining the partner. However, the main issue is the child's well-being. If the father isn't helping, maybe the mother is justified in seeking help. On the other hand, sending a video without context could be problematic, but the situation here seems urgent. The answer might hinge on whether the action was necessary to protect the child. Since the boyfriend isn't helping and there's a risk of harm, the author might be in the right. But legally or ethically, is she in the wrong? Maybe not, since it's about child welfare. So the answer is B.\n"
