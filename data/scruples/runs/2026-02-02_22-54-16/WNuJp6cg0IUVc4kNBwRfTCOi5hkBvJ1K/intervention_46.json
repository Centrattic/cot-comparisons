He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they have a 6-month-old daughter. Since the baby's arrival, the boyfriend hasn't been helping with childcare. He plays video games a lot and only takes care of the baby when she's screaming if the author tells him to. Even then, he might question why she can't do it herself. He only holds the baby if she's calm and handed to him, and he's up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby cries. The author has tried talking to him, and he improves for a week then goes back. She's considering divorce and tried a last effort by leaving the baby in his room and going to a gas station. When she returns, she finds the baby crying and he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom with an explanation. His mom calls him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context. The author is thinking of leaving and wonders if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent, and the baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has tried multiple times to communicate, and the boyfriend isn't consistent. The act of sending the video to his mother seems like an attempt to get support and address the problem, especially after prior failed attempts. However, involving the mother might be seen as tattling or breaching trust. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks the video was taken out of context. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were to protect the child and maybe push the boyfriend to take responsibility. On the other hand, going to his mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if they had prior agreements to handle issues themselves. But in a situation where the child's safety is compromised and the partner isn't improving, the author's actions could be justified as necessary for the child's well-being. The key points are the child's welfare, the boyfriend's consistent neglect, and the author's last-ditch effort. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the primary concern is the child's care. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author tried to correct it. Involving the mother was a way to hold him accountable, even if it's a breach of privacy. The video was a factual recording of the neglect. So the answer would be B.\n"
