He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is a woman who's been with her boyfriend for five years, and they have a baby. Since the baby was born six months ago, her boyfriend refuses to care for the baby. He plays video games, only helps when she's screaming and the woman tells him to, and even then, he questions why she can't do it herself. He holds the baby only when she's calm and handed to him, and he's up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby cries. They've had multiple discussions, and he improves for a week then goes back. She tried telling him she can't handle it, but he relapses. Then she put the baby in his gaming room, went to the gas station, came back to find him ignoring the baby, took a 10-second video, sent it to his mom, who then called him out, leading to him being upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context. Now she's considering divorce and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior. Refusing to care for the baby is a major issue. As a parent, both parents are expected to share responsibilities. His behavior sounds neglectful, especially since the baby needs constant attention. The fact that he only helps when prompted and then questions why she can't do it shows a lack of responsibility and empathy. The mother is clearly overwhelmed, and the boyfriend isn't stepping up.\n\nNow, the author's actions: she staged a situation by putting the baby in his room (presumably to test him) and then sent a video to his mother. Even though she went to the gas station, the intention was to catch him in the act. The key here is whether this was a reasonable step or an overreach. On one hand, she's desperate and trying to hold him accountable. On the other, involving his mother without his knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. However, the mother's reaction (calling him out) might have been justified given the neglect. The question is whether the means she used were appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he's upset about involving his mother and the video being out of context. The author might have intended to show the reality of the situation, but using a staged scenario could be seen as manipulative. However, given the chronic neglect and the baby's well-being, her actions might be considered a necessary step to protect the child and herself.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's neglect is clearly problematic. The author's method of addressing it, while possibly underhanded, might be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. The key factors are the baby's safety and the boyfriend's refusal to help, which are more critical than the method used to expose the neglect. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because the ends (ensuring the baby is cared for) justify the means, especially when she's been trying to resolve the issue through communication without success.\n"
