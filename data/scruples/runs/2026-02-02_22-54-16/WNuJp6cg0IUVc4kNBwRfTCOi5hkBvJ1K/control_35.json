He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is struggling with the boyfriend not helping with their newborn. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't change his behavior. She's at her breaking point and tried a last-ditch effort by leaving the baby with him and going to the gas station. When she returns, he's ignoring the baby, so she videos it and sends it to his mom. The boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context.\n\nNow, considering the context: the mother of the boyfriend is involved, which might be a sensitive area. In some cultures or families, involving parents in such matters can be seen as overstepping. However, the boyfriend isn't helping with their child, which is a critical issue. The author is the one taking care of the baby alone, leading to exhaustion and possible harm to the child.\n\nThe key points here are the well-being of the child and the communication issues in the relationship. The author's actions were desperate and aimed at getting her partner to take responsibility. However, using his mother might have been a poor choice because it could lead to conflict without resolving the underlying problem. Also, the video is evidence but sent to his mother, which might not be the best approach.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the baby's safety and care are at risk, the mother (the author) is justified in trying to make her partner act responsibly. However, the method of involving his mother without his knowledge could be seen as manipulative or crossing boundaries. It's a tough call. On one hand, she's trying to protect her child. On the other, she's escalating the conflict by involving his mother, which might not be the best approach. \n\nBut considering the boyfriend's inaction despite multiple warnings, the author's desperation is understandable. Her actions, while not ideal, stem from a place of need to ensure her child is being cared for. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, some might argue that she should have addressed it directly with her partner without involving his mother, hence making her in the wrong. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the priority is the child's well-being. If the boyfriend is neglecting the child repeatedly, the mother has a responsibility to act. In that case, sending the video to his mother, while perhaps not the best method, is an attempt to protect the child. So, the answer is B.\n"
