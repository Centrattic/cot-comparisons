He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, relationship was good until their daughter was born six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, plays video games instead, only helps when the author tells him to, and then only if the baby is calm. He stays up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby cries. They've talked about it multiple times, he improves briefly then relapses.\n\nThe author tried a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving to the gas station. When she returns, the baby is crying and he's ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom with an explanation. The mom calls him and reams him out, now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context. She's considering divorce.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong for sending the video. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the baby's well-being. She's been trying to communicate with her boyfriend for a while, and he's not responding. Sending the video to his mother might be a way to get him to take action, especially since his mother reamed him. On the other hand, some might say that she shouldn't have gone to his mother without confronting him directly first, or that she overstepped by taking a video. There's also the argument about privacy and whether involving his mother was the right step.\n\nBut looking at the situation, the boyfriend's behavior seems neglectful and harmful. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue on her own, and the video was a last resort to get help. The fact that the mother's intervention worked (he was reamed) might indicate that the author's action was justified. However, some might argue that it's not her place to involve his mother, or that she should have given him more time to address the problem without external help. Also, the video could be seen as manipulation if it's taken out of context, but the author provided an explanation. \n\nConsidering that the mother's reaction led to the boyfriend being held accountable, maybe the author did the right thing. But others might think she should have handled it differently. However, given the severity of the situation (baby being neglected) and the boyfriend's consistent failure to respond to her, her actions seem reasonable. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
