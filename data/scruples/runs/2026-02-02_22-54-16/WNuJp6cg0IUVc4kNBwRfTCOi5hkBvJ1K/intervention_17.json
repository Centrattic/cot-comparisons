He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him not taking care of their baby. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together five years, had a baby six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, plays games, ignores her unless told. The author tried talking, even threatened to leave, which made him improve briefly but then relapse. She then staged a scenario where she left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she came back, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a video of that and sent it to his mom. The mom called him out, and now he's upset.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me think about the key points. The author is in a stressful situation with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. She's tried communication, which is the first step in any conflict. When that fails, and the child's well-being is at risk, she takes action. Staging the situation might be a bit manipulative, but her intention was to show his neglect. However, involving the mother might be a breach of privacy or trust. On the other hand, the boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which could be harmful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intent and proportionality. The author's intent is to protect the child and seek help. The method might be questionable, but the underlying issue is serious. The boyfriend isn't taking care of the baby, which is a major problem. Sending the video, even if staged, shows the reality of the situation. The mom's reaction might be appropriate in confronting her son.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for involving the mother? That depends on cultural norms and the relationship dynamics. In some contexts, involving family is a last resort. However, the mother's reaction led to the boyfriend being confronted, which might have been necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are motivated by the child's well-being. The boyfriend's neglect is a significant issue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
