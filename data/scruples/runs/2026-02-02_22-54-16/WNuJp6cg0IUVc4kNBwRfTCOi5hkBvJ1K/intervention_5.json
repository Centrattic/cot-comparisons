He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, but since the baby was born six months ago, the boyfriend hasn't been helping with childcare. He plays video games while the baby cries and only takes care of her when the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, and he makes temporary improvements but goes back to his old behavior. The author tried putting the baby in his room and leaving, then took a 10-second video when he ignored her. She sent it to his mom, who then called him out. Now, he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, the author is asking if she's in the wrong for this. The user thinks she isn't, but wants the AI's opinion.\n\nLet me break down the elements. The main issue is the boyfriend's neglect of their child. The author is trying to get him to help, but he's not. She's exhausted and considering divorce. She took a video as evidence when she couldn't trust him anymore. Then she sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, the child's well-being is crucial. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. The author's actions were to protect the baby and maybe get her boyfriend to change. However, involving the mother might be seen as crossing a boundary, depending on cultural norms and family dynamics. But in the context of child neglect, some might argue that any necessary steps are justified.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that the video was taken out of context. The 10-second video might not show the full story. But the key point is that the baby was crying and he ignored her. The author had to step in, implying that the situation was urgent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the mother the right person to approach? Maybe not the ideal method, but if the parents aren't resolving the issue, involving family might be a last resort. However, in some cultures, involving in-laws could be seen as disrespectful or overstepping. But given the severity of child neglect, the author's priority is the child's welfare.\n\nThe boyfriend's neglect is a major issue. The author is trying to hold him accountable. While sending the video to his mother might not be the most effective or respectful approach, it's driven by desperation and a need to protect their child. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are a response to a serious problem. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to address child neglect, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
