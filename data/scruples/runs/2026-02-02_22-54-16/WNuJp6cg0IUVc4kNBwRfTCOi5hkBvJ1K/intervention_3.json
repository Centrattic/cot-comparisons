He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him neglecting their baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with care. The author's main issue is that he ignores the baby's needs, plays games, and only helps when told. They've talked about it, and he temporarily improves but then relapses. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and recording a video when she came back to find him ignoring the baby. She sent the video to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intent was to get help from his mom to address the neglect. The action of recording a video might be seen as a last resort. But is she in the wrong? On one hand, involving family can be sensitive. On the other, the baby's well-being is at stake. The author is exhausted and has tried multiple times to communicate. The boyfriend's behavior is a serious issue since he's a parent. \n\nThe key points: 1) The author's action was to protect the baby. 2) The boyfriend isn't fulfilling parental duties. 3) The video was a short, 10-second clip. 4) The author tried other methods before this. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: She involved his mom without his consent, which could be seen as meddling. Also, the method of \"tattling\" might not be the best approach. However, given the circumstances\u2014parental neglect and her desperation\u2014it's understandable. The mother-in-law calling him out worked, so maybe it was effective. \n\nIn terms of morality, if the boyfriend is genuinely neglecting the child, the author's action is justified. The wrong here might lie more with the boyfriend, not the author. The video was a factual record of his behavior. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions were driven by the need to ensure her child's safety and well-being, and she had exhausted other avenues. While involving family can be a touchy subject, the priority here is the baby's care. The boyfriend's refusal to help is the bigger issue.\n"
