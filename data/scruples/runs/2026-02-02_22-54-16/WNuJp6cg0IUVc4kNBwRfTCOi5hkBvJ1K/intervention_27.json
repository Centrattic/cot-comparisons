He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, leading the author to send a video to his mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, despite multiple discussions. The author feels overwhelmed and even considers divorce. In a last attempt, she leaves the baby in his care and then takes a video when he ignores the baby's crying. She sends it to his mom, which leads to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's intention here is to get her boyfriend to take responsibility. By involving his mother, she might be using external pressure. But some might argue that she went too far by involving family without trying other methods first. However, the boyfriend has shown a pattern of not helping, even after being told multiple times. The author is in a stressful situation with a newborn, which is already very demanding.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone's actions are putting a child at risk, others might feel justified in stepping in. The author took a video as evidence, which could be seen as necessary to show the mother. But does that cross a line? Maybe in terms of privacy, but if the child is in danger, maybe not. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The couple has talked about it, but the boyfriend keeps reverting to old habits. The author's actions could be seen as a desperate measure. However, some might say she should have sought counseling or other support before involving the mother. But given the stress of caring for a newborn alone, her actions might be understandable. \n\nLegally, in some places, if a parent is neglecting a child, others can report it to authorities. But she went to the mother instead. That's a family matter, not legal, but the intent is similar\u2014to make him aware. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are a result of being overwhelmed and trying to protect the baby. Her intentions might be in the right place, even if the method was questionable. The key is whether she's at fault. Since the boyfriend isn't helping, and she's trying to get him to take responsibility, the answer might be B (no). But some might argue that she shouldn't have involved the mother. However, given the circumstances, her actions seem justified. So I think the answer is B.\n"
