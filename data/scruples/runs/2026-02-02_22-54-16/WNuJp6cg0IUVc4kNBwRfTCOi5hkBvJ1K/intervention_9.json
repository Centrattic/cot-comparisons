He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after multiple attempts to communicate, the author decides to take this step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is refusing to care for their daughter, which is a serious issue. The mother is handling all the childcare, which is exhausting. They've talked about it multiple times, and the boyfriend's behavior hasn't improved. The author tried a last-ditch effort by leaving to get gas, but he ignored the baby. She recorded a video and sent it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. Is the author justified in her actions? Well, the well-being of the child is paramount. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which could be detrimental to the child's development and the mother's mental health. The author tried to address the problem through communication, but it didn't work. Sending the video to the mother might be seen as a way to get support, especially from someone close to the boyfriend who can influence him.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy and trust. The boyfriend might feel that the video was taken without his consent and shared in a way that's public or could be misinterpreted. However, given that the child's welfare is at stake, the mother might argue that it's necessary. The act of sending the video could be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is a significant parental duty. The author's actions were aimed at getting him to take responsibility, possibly through the intervention of his mother. The method might be questionable, but the intent is to protect the child and herself. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have handled it another way, like legal steps or professional help, but given the situation, she might not have those resources or time. The immediate need for the child's care is critical, so the video serves as evidence of neglect. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions, while perhaps not the most ideal method, stem from a place of necessity to ensure her child's well-being. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
