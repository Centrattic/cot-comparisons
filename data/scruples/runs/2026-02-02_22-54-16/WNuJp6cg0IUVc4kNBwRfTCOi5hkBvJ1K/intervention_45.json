He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author tattling on their boyfriend to his mother because he's not taking care of their baby. They've been together 5 years, and since the baby was born 6 months ago, the boyfriend refuses to care for the child. The author tried many things, including talking to him, but he keeps going back to the same behavior. In a last attempt, she left the baby in his room, went to the gas station, and when she came back, the baby was crying and he didn't help. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points here are the boyfriend's neglect of the baby, the author's attempts to resolve the issue, and the action of sending the video to the mother. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior: not helping with the baby, playing games instead, only helping when the baby is screaming and the author tells him to, asking why she can't do it, holding the baby only when it's calm, and staying up late. This seems like a significant issue because caring for a newborn is a huge responsibility and both parents should share that. The author has tried talking, he improves temporarily but goes back to the same behavior. That shows she's given him chances to improve.\n\nNow, the action she took: she put the baby in his room, left for a bit, came back, took a video, and sent it to his mom. The intention here seems to be to get his mother to intervene since he's not responding to her. The problem is that she took a 10-second video, which might be taken out of context. The boyfriend is upset because he feels she involved his mother without reason and that the video is misleading.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, she's at her wit's end, considering divorce, and tried a last-ditch effort. The video served as evidence of his neglect. However, involving his mother might not be the best approach, as it's not directly resolving their issue together. Also, sending a video could be seen as manipulative or an overreaction, especially if it's a short clip that doesn't show the full context. The boyfriend could argue that the mother's involvement is an intrusion into their personal matters.\n\nBut on the other hand, the severity of the situation is that the baby's well-being is at stake. If the father is neglecting his responsibilities, that's a serious concern. The author is trying to get help from his mother because he's not listening. So, is the author wrong for taking that step? It's a delicate balance between personal boundaries and the well-being of the child.\n\nIn some cultures or families, involving in-laws might be seen as crossing a line, but when a child's care is involved, some might argue it's justified. The key is whether the mother's intervention was appropriate and if the video was a fair representation. Since the author explains the context when sending the video, maybe the mother could understand the situation. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt it was taken out of context, which complicates things.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. She's in a stressful situation and tried multiple times to resolve the issue without success. Her action, while perhaps not the best approach, might be understandable given the circumstances. However, the method of involving his mother could be seen as overstepping. But since the child's safety and care are involved, some might argue it's justified. So, leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given the severity of the neglect and her attempts to resolve it, I think the answer is B, No.\n"
