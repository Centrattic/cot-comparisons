He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the couple has a 6-month-old, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games, ignores the baby's crying unless the author tells him, and when he does hold the baby, it's only when it's calm. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, and he briefly improves but then goes back to his old ways. She tried leaving the baby in his room and going out, then came back to find him ignoring the baby and took a video. She sent the video to his mom, which led to the mom scolding him, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about the key points here. First, the boyfriend's behavior: not helping with the baby, ignoring her needs, not being supportive. The author is clearly struggling with the responsibilities alone, which is a lot. She's tried communicating, but he's not changing. She's at her breaking point, considering divorce. \n\nNow, the action in question: she sent a video to his mom. Why did she do that? Because she felt he wasn't taking it seriously, maybe hoping his mom could influence him. But involving family can be sensitive. However, the situation is about the well-being of a child, which is a serious matter. The mom's reaction was to confront him, which might be effective. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing this? On one hand, it's understandable she's desperate and wants help. On the other hand, sending a video without his consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Also, involving his mother might be seen as stepping over a boundary, especially if he's not open to his family being involved. However, the context is a child's welfare, which is a strong justification. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is harmful, and the author has tried everything else. The video was a 10-second clip, which might be necessary to show the situation. So, while it's a tough call, the author's actions were driven by concern for the baby's well-being and her own mental health. The wrongness here might depend on cultural norms and how the family handles such issues. But given that the child's care is in question, her actions might be seen as justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have handled it differently, like involving child protective services if it's that serious, but given that she's considering divorce and the situation is ongoing, maybe involving family was her way to seek support. The key is the intent: protecting the child vs. violating privacy. Since the child's needs are paramount, she might not be in the wrong. So, likely answer B.\n"
