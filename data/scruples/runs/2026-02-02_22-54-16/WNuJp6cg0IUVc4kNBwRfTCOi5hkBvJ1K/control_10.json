He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games instead, only helps when told, and ignores the baby's crying. The author tried talking to him multiple times, but he doesn't change consistently. She even tried leaving the baby in his room, then went to the gas station, and when she returned, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context. The question is if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, what do we consider here? Well, she's a parent and her baby's well-being is at stake. The father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is causing her stress. She's tried to communicate, but he's not changing. In her desperation, she documents the situation and informs the mother. On the other hand, involving the mother-in-law might be seen as tattling, and using a video could be seen as an invasion of privacy or taken out of context. But the key is whether the baby is being neglected. If the father is neglecting the child, then the mother might feel justified in seeking help from family. However, the method of involving the mother might be seen as inappropriate, especially without his consent. \n\nBut the video was taken in a situation where the baby was in danger of not being attended to. She was trying to get her partner to change his behavior. The mother-in-law's reaction suggests that the action was effective. The boyfriend is upset because he feels she's using the video against him. So, is she wrong? Well, the intent was to protect the child, which is a priority. However, the method of involving the mother might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, she's at her breaking point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. On one hand, parents should handle such issues themselves, and involving family can be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, the welfare of the child is paramount. If the father isn't providing care, the mother is justified in seeking intervention, even if it's through family. The video as evidence could be necessary. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
