He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author has tried talking to him, but he doesn't change his behavior. She tried a last effort by leaving, but he ignored the baby. She took a video and sent it to his mom, which made him upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, the author has tried to address it multiple times without success, and she took the video as evidence to show his mother. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, involving his mother without consulting him might be seen as overstepping, especially since they're a couple. Normally, you handle issues within the relationship first. But on the other hand, the situation is about a child's well-being. If the father is neglecting the child, there's a higher responsibility to ensure the child's safety. \n\nThe law might require reporting child neglect, but here she's informing the mother, not authorities. However, her intention was to get the mother to intervene. The boyfriend's argument is that the video was out of context, but if the video shows him ignoring a crying baby, that's a serious issue.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. She's exhausted and trying to protect her child. While tattling might not be the ideal approach, the core issue is neglect. Depending on cultural norms and expectations, involving family can be a way to get help. However, in relationships, involving family can be a big step. \n\nBut since the child's welfare is at stake, and the boyfriend hasn't changed despite repeated requests, her actions might be justified. The key is whether the mother-in-law's involvement was necessary. If the boyfriend's behavior is harmful, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. The question is about being in the wrong, not about the boyfriend's actions. She took a video and sent it to his mom. Was that wrong? If the mother was a parent figure in his life, maybe she felt it was a way to get support. But in a relationship, you usually handle things between the two partners. However, given the severity of the neglect, maybe she had a reason to involve his mother to force him to change. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is that she took the video out of context. But the video itself is a direct example of his neglect. So, she's not wrong for documenting the neglect. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the core issue is the child's well-being, and she's trying to address a serious problem that she can't resolve alone.\n"
