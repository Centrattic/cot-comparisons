He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author is the one handling everything, and they've tried talking to him multiple times without success. Finally, she leaves the baby in his room, goes to the gas station, and when she comes back, he's ignoring the crying baby. She takes a video and sends it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether \"tattling\" to the mother is wrong. On one hand, the author is clearly stressed and overwhelmed. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his responsibilities as a parent, which is causing her to feel unsupported. She's tried communication, but it hasn't worked. Her actions might be a last resort to make him realize the severity of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, involving the mother could be seen as overstepping. Maybe the couple should have worked through it themselves first without family interference. But considering the well-being of the child, if the father isn't responding to his daughter's needs, there might be valid concerns about the child's safety and care. The video serves as evidence of neglect, which is a serious matter. \n\nBut then, the method of sending the video to the mother might be problematic. Instead of directly addressing the issue with her partner again, she goes behind his back. However, given her history of trying to communicate and being met with resistance, maybe she felt it was necessary to involve another adult to get him to take it seriously. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mother was able to confront him and he changed his behavior temporarily (even if he reverted) shows that the video had an impact. But the author now faces backlash for involving his mother. \n\nI should consider if there's a right or wrong here. The author's actions were driven by desperation and concern for the child. The boyfriend's neglect is the root problem. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to ensure the child's well-being. However, bypassing the partner and going to the mother could be seen as undermining the relationship. \n\nBut in terms of wrongdoing, the boyfriend isn't helping the baby, which is a serious issue. The author's actions might be justified as a parent's duty to protect the child. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The key is whether the action was proportionate and necessary. Since the child's needs are critical, the author might not be at fault. So, the answer could be B (No). But I need to check if there's another angle. Maybe there are better ways to handle it, but given the circumstances, her actions were a last resort. So B.\n"
