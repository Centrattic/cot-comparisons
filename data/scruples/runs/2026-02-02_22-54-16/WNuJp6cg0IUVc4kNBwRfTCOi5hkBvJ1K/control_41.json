He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video of their boyfriend neglecting their baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He plays games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and only holds her when it's convenient. The author has tried discussing it multiple times without success. She tried leaving the baby in his room and recording him ignoring her, then sent the video to his mom. His mom confronted him, he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's intention was to get her boyfriend to take responsibility. She felt at her breaking point and tried a last effort. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nOn one hand, involving the mother could be seen as crossing a boundary. Couples usually handle such issues themselves before involving family, which might lead to tension. Also, recording without consent could be a privacy issue, depending on location. However, the context is child neglect, which is a serious matter. The author's actions led to the boyfriend's mother addressing the issue, which he hadn't responded to before.\n\nBut the boyfriend is now upset because of the video and the mother's involvement. The ethical dilemma here is balancing the duty to protect the child versus respecting the couple's privacy. The author's actions were driven by desperation after failed attempts to resolve the situation. However, the method she used might have been extreme. Instead of involving his mother, she could have sought other support like counseling or legal advice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. While the intent was to help the situation, the method might not be the best approach. But considering the child's well-being is paramount, some might argue her actions were justified. However, others might say she should have handled it within the relationship first. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specifics of the situation. Since the user asks for a binary answer, but the situation is complex, I need to weigh these factors.\n"
