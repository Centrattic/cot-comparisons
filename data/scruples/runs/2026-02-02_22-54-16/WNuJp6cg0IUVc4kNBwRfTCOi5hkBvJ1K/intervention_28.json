He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for sending a video to the boyfriend's mother showing him not caring for their baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple discussions. The author tried a last effort by leaving and putting the baby in his room, then took a video when he ignored her. Sent it to his mom, who confronted him.\n\nSo, the key points. The boyfriend's neglect is causing the author stress, and they've tried to talk about it without success. The author's action was to create evidence of the neglect and share it with his mother. Now, the boyfriend is upset about involving his mom and the video's context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a moral dilemma. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the baby's well-being and possibly encourage the boyfriend to take responsibility. On the other, sharing the video without direct communication with the boyfriend might be seen as bypassing him, leading to potential conflict and privacy issues.\n\nBut the boyfriend's repeated refusal to help is a significant problem. The author's action was a desperate move to get support. The mother's reaction could lead to a resolution, which the author might need if the boyfriend isn't changing. However, using a video as evidence might be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut considering the context, the author is in a tough spot. The boyfriend's behavior is harmful, and if he's not responding to direct communication, involving his mother might be a way to address the issue. The video was a short clip, not shared with malicious intent, but to show the problem. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's neglect is the main issue, and the action taken was to highlight that. Answer B.\n"
