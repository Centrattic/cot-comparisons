He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him ignoring their crying baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The couple has a baby, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author has tried discussing it multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he keeps reverting to the same behavior. She put the baby in his room, left for a bit, came back to find him ignoring the baby, took a video, and sent it to his mom. His mom then confronted him, and now he's angry with her for involving his mom and the video being out of context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of parental responsibility. The author has made numerous attempts to resolve this, and when that fails, she takes a drastic step to involve his mother. \n\nOn one hand, using a video to show his mother might be seen as an invasion of privacy or a manipulative tactic. But on the other hand, the baby's well-being is at stake. The author's actions were driven by desperation after trying everything else. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's actions are clearly problematic. The author's actions, while perhaps extreme, were aimed at protecting the child and addressing a serious problem. The mother's reaction (calling him out) seems appropriate given the situation. The boyfriend's anger towards the author for exposing his neglect might be misplaced. \n\nHowever, involving family can sometimes complicate matters. But in this case, it seems like a last resort to get him to take responsibility. The video was a short, 10-second clip, which might not fully capture the context, but the mother's call to action was effective. \n\nI think the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. Her priority was her child's welfare, and she had exhausted other options. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
