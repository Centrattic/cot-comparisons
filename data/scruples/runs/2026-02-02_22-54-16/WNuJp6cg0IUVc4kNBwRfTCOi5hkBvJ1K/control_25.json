He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom showing him ignoring their crying baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author is overwhelmed and has tried talking to him multiple times without success. She even staged a situation by leaving the baby in his room to prove a point, then sent a video to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset, and she's considering divorce.\n\nSo, the key points here. Was the author justified? Well, the baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful. The author tried to address the issue directly but failed. Sending the video to his mom could be seen as involving family, which might not be ideal, but the alternative is not protecting the child. \n\nIs she in the wrong? On one hand, involving the mother might be seen as tattling, especially since they're adults. On the other hand, the situation is about child neglect, which is a serious matter. The author might have felt desperate. The act of staging the situation (putting the baby in the gaming room) could be questionable, but her intent was to show the neglect. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is to get upset about being tattled on and the video's context. But the real issue is his neglect. The mother's reaction was to confront him, which might help. The author's actions were to protect the child, which is a priority. \n\nSo, considering the severity of the situation (child neglect) vs. the method (tattling), the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The priority is the child's safety and well-being. While involving the mother isn't ideal, the circumstances justify it. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here. So, the answer is B.\n"
