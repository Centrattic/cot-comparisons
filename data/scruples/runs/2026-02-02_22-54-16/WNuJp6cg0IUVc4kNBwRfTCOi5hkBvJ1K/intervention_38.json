He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for sending the video to her boyfriend's mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together for five years and had a daughter six months ago. Their relationship has deteriorated because the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games instead of caring for her, only responds when the author tells him to, and even then, he questions why she can't do it. He also won't hold the baby unless she's calm and handed to him. He stays up late gaming but doesn't help when the baby cries. They've talked about it multiple times, and the author is considering divorce. \n\nThe author tried a last effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving to the gas station. When she returned, the baby was crying and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him and reamed him, making him upset with her for involving his mom and context. Now the author is considering leaving but is asking if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author feels neglected and is overwhelmed, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, and she took action by involving his mother. \n\nOn one hand, some might argue that she should have handled it privately without involving his mom. Maybe she should have given him more chances or sought couples counseling. Involving the mother might have crossed a boundary, especially if the boyfriend felt it was an invasion of privacy. The video, even if short, could be seen as evidence, but maybe there's more context that wasn't shown. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a stressful situation with the health of an infant at stake. She's tried multiple times to communicate, and he's not changing his behavior. Her actions might be seen as a necessary step to get him to take responsibility, especially if she's at her breaking point. The mother's reaction suggests that the action was effective in making the boyfriend face accountability.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? If the boyfriend isn't helping, and she's in a vulnerable position, maybe her actions were justified to protect the child and herself. However, using his mom might be a controversial method. It could strain the family relationship further and might not be the best approach, but in terms of moral fault, the boyfriend's neglect is the root issue. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the boyfriend is not fulfilling his duties and the author is acting in the child's best interest, even if the method is questionable, the answer might be B. But others might argue that she should have handled it differently, making it A. \n\nBut given the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting an infant\u2014it's possible that her actions were a last resort, and thus not in the wrong. So leaning towards B.\n"
