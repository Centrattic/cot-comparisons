He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn, and the author felt forced to involve his mother after multiple failed attempts to get him to change his behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together five years, and since the daughter was born six months ago, the boyfriend refuses to care for her. He plays video games, only helps when the baby is screaming and the author tells him to, and he doesn't help when the baby cries at night. They've talked multiple times, but the boyfriend's behavior doesn't change. The author tried putting the baby in his room and leaving, then sent a video to his mom after he ignored the baby again. The mom called him out, he's upset with the author for involving his mom and the video. The author is considering divorce but is now being blamed by the boyfriend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's a parent trying to protect her child. The dad isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, and she's exhausted. She tried to communicate and even staged a confrontation to show her mom-in-law the problem. Her actions were to get help because she couldn't handle it alone. But is this overstepping? Involving the mother might be seen as tattling, especially if the couple hasn't resolved the issue between themselves. However, given the context of a newborn and the father's neglect, some might argue she had no choice. \n\nOn the other hand, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend might feel that she didn't handle it properly by going over his head. But considering the well-being of the child, her actions could be justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the potential harm. The author's intent was to protect her child and seek help. The action, while perhaps unorthodox, was driven by desperation and the child's welfare. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. So the author is not in the wrong because she acted in the child's best interest after exhausting other options. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
