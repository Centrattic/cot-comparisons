He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The key points here are the boyfriend's behavior towards their newborn, the author's attempts to address it, and her final action of involving the mother.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He refuses to care for her, only steps in when prompted, and ignores her when she's crying. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he relapses into his old habits. This is a serious issue because the baby's needs aren't being met, which is a significant stressor for any parent.\n\nThe author's action was to put the baby in his gaming room, leave, and come back to film him when the baby was crying. She sent the video to his mom to intervene. Now, the question is whether this action was justified or if she was wrong to do so. \n\nOn one hand, the mother-in-law called him out, which might have been effective, but the boyfriend is upset because she involved his mother and said the video was out of context. The ethical angle here is about the method used. Was sending the video a breach of trust or a necessary step?\n\nLegally, there might not be an issue, but morally, it's a gray area. The author felt she couldn't trust him and took a drastic measure to get help. However, involving the mother might have been a way to force accountability. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is dealing with the stress of parenting alone. \n\nBut did she have other options? Maybe she could have sought counseling or other support before involving family. Still, given the circumstances, her intention was to protect the baby and herself. The act of taking a video might be seen as an invasion of privacy, but given the baby's welfare is at stake, it's understandable. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. Her goal was to ensure the baby's well-being. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to address a serious problem. Therefore, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
