He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple with a newborn. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and the author is frustrated. She tried talking to him, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. Then she decides to put the baby in his room and leave, but actually goes to the gas station. When she comes back, he's ignoring the baby, so she takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom. The mom calls him out, he's upset, and now the author is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, and the baby's well-being is a top priority. If the father isn't fulfilling his parental duties, that's a serious issue. The author has tried multiple times to communicate and resolve the problem, but it's not working. The breaking point comes when she leaves the baby with him, thinking she's going to leave, but actually just goes out. She comes back to find him ignoring the baby, takes a video, and sends it to his mom.\n\nIs she wrong for involving the mother? Well, sometimes involving family can complicate things. The boyfriend might feel that the author is overstepping by contacting his mom. But on the other hand, if the baby is being neglected, the mother might have a responsibility to step in if the father isn't helping. The author's intention was to get the mother to confront the boyfriend about his behavior because she felt she couldn't handle it alone anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the well-being of the child and the couple's communication. The author has tried to resolve the issue directly but hasn't succeeded. The act of sending the video to the mother might be seen as a last resort, but it's possible that the author should have sought another form of intervention first, like involving other family members or professionals, rather than the boyfriend's mother, which could create tension. However, given the situation, the author's actions might be justified as a way to protect the child's welfare.\n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend's inaction is a problem. If he's not fulfilling his responsibilities, it's a sign of potential neglect. The author is in a stressful situation, and her actions might be a result of desperation. The mother's reaction could be appropriate in that she confronts her son, but the author's method of involving the mother without the boyfriend's consent might be seen as tattling, depending on the cultural context and family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to ensure the baby's safety and address the boyfriend's neglect. However, the method of involving the mother without discussing it with the boyfriend first might be where she overstepped. It's possible that the couple should have sought counseling or other support systems instead of using the mother as a mediator. But given the circumstances, the author's actions could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her primary concern was the child's welfare, and she had tried other means first. However, there's a valid argument that she should have handled it differently. But overall, protecting the child takes precedence, so she's justified.\n"
