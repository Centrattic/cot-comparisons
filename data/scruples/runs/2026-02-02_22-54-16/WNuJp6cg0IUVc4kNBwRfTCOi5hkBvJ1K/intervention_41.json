He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother. The situation is pretty intense. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple discussions. The author feels overwhelmed and tried sending the video as a last resort after he reverted to old habits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother is the primary caregiver here, dealing with the stress of a newborn and a partner who's not contributing. She's tried communicating, even threatening to leave, but he keeps going back to not helping. Putting the baby in his room might be a way to force his hand, but maybe that's a risky move. Then, when she leaves for a bit, he ignores the baby. She records a 10-second video and sends it to his mom, leading to conflict.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, using a parent to intervene might be seen as tattling, but in this case, it's about the well-being of a child. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which is a serious issue. The mother is in a vulnerable position, and maybe she's desperate. Sending the video could be a way to hold him accountable, especially if he's not responding to direct communication. However, involving his mother without his consent might have breached trust. But given the situation, is that justified?\n\nAlso, the mother's actions could be seen as a last resort. She's tried everything else. The video is a factual evidence of neglect. The boyfriend's reaction about \"taking out of context\" might be an excuse to avoid responsibility. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a moral dilemma. On one hand, she's trying to protect her child and herself. On the other, she's involving his mother without consulting him. However, given that his behavior is harmful, maybe the ends justify the means. The mother isn't in the wrong for trying to get help when all else failed. So I think the answer is B.\n"
