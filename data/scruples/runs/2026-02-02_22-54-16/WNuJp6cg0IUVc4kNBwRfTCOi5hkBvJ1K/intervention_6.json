He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother showing him not taking care of their baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend isn't helping with their daughter, especially when she's crying. The author tried multiple times to talk to him, and he only temporarily changes his behavior. She's really stressed and considering divorce. In a last attempt, she put the baby in his room and left, then came back to find him ignoring the baby. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, which led to his mom calling him out. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mother and the video being out of context.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault here? The user says they think she's not in the wrong. Let's break it down. The core issue is the boyfriend's neglect of the baby. The author is trying to get him to take responsibility. She tried talking, but it didn't work. She felt she couldn't trust him, so she used a video as evidence. \n\nNow, sending the video to his mom\u2014does that cross a line? Well, she's trying to get his mom to intervene because the boyfriend isn't responding. But is it justified? On one hand, she's trying to protect the baby's well-being, which is a priority. On the other hand, involving his mother might be seen as tattling, especially if they had already discussed the issue without involving family. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014neglect of an infant\u2014it's a serious matter. The boyfriend isn't taking care of the baby, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset about being tattled on and the video being out of context. But if the video shows him ignoring the baby when she's crying, that's a direct example of his neglect. The author took action because she felt she had no other choice after repeated failures. She's in a difficult position, balancing her own stress and the baby's needs.\n\nIs there a better way she could have handled it? Maybe, but the key point is whether she's in the wrong. If her intent was to ensure the baby's safety and well-being, and she felt that her own efforts were failing, then involving the mother might be a last resort. However, some might argue that she should have handled it through other means first, like counseling or legal steps, but given the context of their relationship and the urgency, her actions might be seen as justified. The mother-in-law's reaction (calling him out) could lead to some change, which is what the author was hoping for. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The main issue is the boyfriend's neglect, and the author's actions were aimed at addressing that. While involving the mother isn't ideal, the circumstances justify it given the baby's welfare.\n"
