He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The main issue is the boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior: he's not taking care of the baby, plays video games instead, and only helps when told. The author has tried talking multiple times, but he relapses into old habits. She's exhausted and considering divorce. She staged a scenario to prove her point by leaving the baby in his room and then leaving briefly. When she came back, the baby was crying and he wasn't helping, so she took a video and sent it to his mom.\n\nNow, analyzing if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: she's in a stressful situation, the baby's well-being is a priority. She tried all communication methods and he didn't change. She felt she couldn't trust him, so she set up a test. Sending the video to his mom might be seen as a way to get his attention, but it's a private matter. However, involving family can sometimes escalate things. But in this case, her child's care is at stake. The boyfriend is neglecting responsibilities, and she's the one suffering from the lack of support. \n\nIs she wrong for sending the video? It's a tough call. On one hand, she's trying to protect her child and her own mental health. On the other hand, using a staged scenario and involving his mother without his consent could be seen as manipulative. But given the context of ongoing neglect and her desperation, her actions might be understandable. The mother-in-law's reaction might have been harsh, but the root issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The author's intent was to show the reality, not to \"tattle\" without cause. So, likely not in the wrong.\n"
