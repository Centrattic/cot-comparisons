He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. So, the situation is that the couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He plays video games instead, only steps in when the baby is crying if the author tells him to. They've talked about it multiple times, and he improves briefly but then goes back. The author tried leaving the baby in his room with a video, took a video of him ignoring the baby, and sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and now he's upset with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities, which is causing significant stress on the author. She's the primary caregiver, and this is affecting their relationship. She's tried communication multiple times without success. The last attempt was a test where she left the baby with him, took a video, and sent it to his mom. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, using a video to involve his mother could be seen as tattling, but the stakes are high\u2014it's a baby's well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful. However, involving family can backfire, especially if it causes more conflict. But given that he's not taking responsibility and the baby's needs are critical, maybe her actions were justified as a last resort. \n\nOn the other hand, she could have considered other steps before involving his mother, like counseling or legal advice. But with the stress of a newborn and the situation deteriorating, maybe she felt cornered. The key is whether her actions were proportionate and intended to protect the child. If the video was a direct example of neglect, then sharing it might be seen as necessary. But in a relationship, bypassing the partner and going to the mother might have been a poor choice, but not entirely her fault given the circumstances. \n\nSo, in the context of parental responsibilities and the child's welfare, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
