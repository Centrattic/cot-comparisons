He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's in a 5-year relationship and has a 6-month-old daughter, is dealing with a boyfriend who refuses to help with childcare. The boyfriend plays video games, ignores the baby's cries unless told, and only holds the baby when she's calm. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he only improves for a week before reverting. \n\nNow, the author tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his gaming room and leaving to the gas station. When she returned, the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mother with an explanation. His mother called him and reamed him out, and now the boyfriend is upset with the author for involving his mom and \"taking the video out of context.\" The author is considering divorce and is asking if they're in the wrong for sending the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental responsibilities. The author has tried to communicate and resolve the issue multiple times without success. The act of sending the video to his mother is what's in question here. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to think about boundaries in relationships. Generally, involving a relative (like his mother) without the partner's consent might be seen as overstepping, especially if the couple is supposed to handle their own issues. However, the context matters. The author is in a stressful situation, and the baby's well-being is at stake. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, which could be a serious issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author had the right to involve the mother. If the couple couldn't resolve the issue themselves, maybe the author felt desperate and saw this as a way to get through to the boyfriend. But from another angle, bringing in family can cause tension and might not be the best approach. The boyfriend might feel that the author betrayed his privacy or didn't trust him enough to handle the problem without external intervention.\n\nHowever, the baby's welfare is crucial. Neglecting a child's basic needs is a serious matter. If the author felt that the boyfriend wasn't going to change despite her efforts, then using this method to make the boyfriend accountable could be seen as justified, especially if the mother could influence him. On the other hand, the method of sending a video without discussing it with him first might be seen as not giving him a chance to explain or fix the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the method of confrontation. The author could have approached the boyfriend directly after the incident, explained her feelings, and discussed the issue, rather than involving his mother. But maybe she tried that and it didn't work. The fact that he only improved for a week suggests that the problem is recurring, and she's at her limit.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, involving the mother might not be the ideal approach, but the context of the neglect and the author's prior efforts to resolve the issue could be justifications. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal boundaries. In some views, the action is understandable given the circumstances, while others might say that the author should have handled it differently without involving family. \n\nI think the key points are the boyfriend's neglect, the author's prior attempts to resolve the issue, and the desperation leading to involving the mother. The act of taking a video and sending it could be seen as a last resort to get through to him. So, while the method might not be ideal, the situation is extreme. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer could be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe the author did overstep by involving his mother without discussing it with him first. But given the circumstances, it's a complex situation.\n"
