He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother about him not taking care of their baby. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has a 6-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. The author says he plays games, ignores the baby's cries, and only helps when she tells him to. They've had multiple talks, but he keeps going back to the same behavior. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and then leaving to get gas, then took a 10-second video when he ignored the baby. She sent it to his mom, which led to the mom confronting him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue is the neglect of their child. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious matter. The author is trying to address this by involving his mother as a last resort after other attempts failed. \n\nOn one hand, involving a parent in a family matter can be seen as tattling, especially if the couple wasn't supposed to be handling things this way. But on the other hand, the wellbeing of the child is at stake. The video was 10 seconds, perhaps to document the situation. The boyfriend's response is that the video was out of context, but the author's action was to protect the child from neglect.\n\nIn such cases, the priority is the child's safety. If the mother feels that her partner isn't taking care of the baby and has tried multiple times to resolve it without success, involving family might be a step to enforce responsibility. However, there's a line between seeking help and overstepping. The key points are the intent behind the action and the necessity of the action. \n\nBut in this case, the author's intent was to protect the child, not to humiliate or sabotage. The boyfriend isn't responding to discussions, so maybe the author felt desperate. However, sending the video to his mother could have been a breach of trust between them, even if the issue is serious. The author might have handled it differently, but the situation is about the child's welfare. \n\nIn parenting, especially when there's neglect, sometimes external intervention is necessary. The author did try multiple times to resolve the issue directly before taking this step. The fact that the boyfriend improved briefly but then reverted might indicate he's not taking the problem seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be justified as a last resort to ensure the child's care. However, the method of involving the mother could be seen as crossing a boundary. But given the child's safety is the priority, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have sought other avenues first, like counseling or legal steps instead of involving his mother. \n\nIn summary, the answer depends on whether the action was necessary and proportionate. The author's intent was to protect the child, and after multiple failures, the step taken might be understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
