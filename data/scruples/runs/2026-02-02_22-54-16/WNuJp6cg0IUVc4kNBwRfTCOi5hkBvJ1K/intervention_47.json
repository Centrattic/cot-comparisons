He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom showing him ignoring their crying baby.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only steps in when the baby is screaming if told, and even then, he's not proactive. The author has tried talking about it multiple times, and he temporarily improves but then goes back. She tried leaving the baby in his room and going to the gas station, then sent a video to his mom. The mom called him out, and now he's upset with her for involving his mother and the context of the video.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. The key points are the father's neglect and the author's method of addressing it. The father's behavior is concerning because he's not fulfilling his parental responsibilities. The author tried to resolve it through communication, which he didn't take seriously. Then, she escalated by involving the mother-in-law, which can be a sensitive area.\n\nBut is that justified? In terms of the baby's well-being, neglecting a child is a serious issue. The author felt she couldn't trust him, so she took action to ensure the baby's safety. However, involving the mother might have been a breach of trust between them. The father might feel that she didn't handle it privately enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's behavior is clearly problematic. The author's actions were to protect the child, which is a parent's duty. The video was a factual record of neglect. Even though involving the mother might not be ideal, the priority is the child's welfare. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because the child's safety is paramount, and she exhausted other methods. The father's inaction is the root issue here. Therefore, answer B.\n"
