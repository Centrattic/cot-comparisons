He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a parent in a 5-year relationship that's been struggling since their daughter was born six months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, prefers to play video games, and only engages when the author forces him. They've talked about it multiple times, but he keeps reverting. The author tried a last effort by pretending to leave, then sent a video of him ignoring the baby when she was screaming to his mom, which led to the mom confronting him. Now, the boyfriend is upset with the author for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). The answer needs to be just A or B, but I need to think through the reasoning.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is dealing with a partner who's not fulfilling parental duties, which is causing significant stress. They tried communication, then escalated by involving the boyfriend's mother. The mother's reaction was to reprimand the boyfriend, but the boyfriend is now upset with the author for tattling.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, parents have a responsibility to care for their children. If one parent is neglecting this duty, the other might feel forced to take action. However, the method of action here\u2014telling the mother-in-law and taking a video\u2014might be problematic.\n\nIn some cultures, involving parents in adult children's issues is common, but in others, it's seen as meddling. The author's intent was to get the boyfriend to take responsibility, but by going around him to his mother, it could come off as undermining his authority or privacy. The boyfriend's reaction might be about feeling betrayed rather than the neglect itself.\n\nLegally, parents do have a duty to care for their child, but the video as evidence could be relevant if the situation escalates to legal action. However, the immediate issue here is the interpersonal conflict between the couple.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the child, but the method of using the mother might be a breach of trust. However, if the author felt they had no other option and the situation was dire, some might sympathize with their actions. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the mother's involvement was an overstep and that the couple should have resolved it themselves.\n\nSo, in AITA terms, it's a balance between the severity of the neglect and the method of addressing it. The author is in a tough spot, but maybe the answer depends on cultural norms and how the action was perceived. However, the core issue is the neglect, and the action taken was to stop it. If the author is being blamed for trying to protect the child, that might not be fair. But if the way they did it caused more harm (like straining family relationships), that's a different angle.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who is trying to protect a child from neglect is often seen as justified, even if the method is questionable. However, involving a parent in a way that the other partner finds hurtful might be seen as a misstep. The boyfriend being upset might be because he feels his privacy was invaded, but the author's intent was to save the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer could be B. But there's a nuance here. Maybe the author should have considered other steps before involving the mother, but given the repeated failures to communicate and the critical need for child care, the action might be justified. So, probably answer B.\n"
