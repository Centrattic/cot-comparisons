He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by tattling on her boyfriend to his mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their baby, and after multiple attempts to talk, the author took a video and sent it to his mom. The boyfriend is upset, and now she's considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, the author tried to talk about it multiple times without success, leading to her taking the video and sending it to his mom. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nThe author's actions: she put the baby in his room, went out, came back to find him ignoring the baby, took a video, then sent it to his mom. His mom called him out, and he's upset with her for involving his mom and the video being taken out of context.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is in a stressful situation with a newborn, and her partner isn't stepping up. She's tried communicating, but he's not changing. The video was a way to document the issue to his mother. The boyfriend is defensive, accusing her of taking it out of context. The mother involved the father, which might have caused tension between the couple.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using a video to show a parent that the partner isn't helping could be seen as a necessary step if all else fails. However, involving his mother directly might not be the best approach. Typically, couples are encouraged to handle such issues between themselves first. By involving his mother, she might have overstepped, leading to the boyfriend feeling attacked. But given the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting a baby\u2014it's understandable she felt desperate.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's reaction could have been harsh, which might have made the boyfriend defensive. The video being taken without his knowledge might be a privacy issue, but the context is about protecting the baby. The author is in a vulnerable position, so her actions, while perhaps extreme, are driven by concern for the child's welfare.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a tough call. The boyfriend isn't helping, which is a major issue. The author tried to resolve it, and when that failed, took a drastic step. Whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural norms and how direct communication is expected. If the mother's involvement was appropriate, maybe not. But if the author should have handled it without involving his family, then she might be at fault. However, since the father isn't cooperating, and the child's well-being is at stake, her actions might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, it's possible she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. The key is whether tattling was necessary. Since the author tried everything else and the situation is critical for the baby, sending the video to the mother could be seen as a last resort to get the father to act. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
