He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their newborn daughter, and after multiple attempts to address it, she took a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend has been neglecting his responsibilities as a parent. The author has tried to communicate this multiple times without success. She's exhausted and considering divorce. Her action of sending the video was to get his mother's intervention. \n\nOn one hand, involving his mother might be seen as overstepping, especially if they had not previously discussed involving family in their issues. But on the other hand, she's in a critical situation with a newborn and her partner isn't fulfilling his duties. The video was a way to document the neglect, which could be necessary if she's considering legal actions or needs evidence of neglect. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is to be upset about the video being taken and the mother's reaction. That shows he's aware his behavior is problematic, but he's deflecting blame onto the author. The key here is the intent behind the action. The author's intent was to seek help for a serious issue affecting their child's well-being. \n\nIn situations involving child neglect, taking steps to ensure the child's safety is often prioritized. The method might be questionable, but the underlying issue is serious. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and how the mother reacted. However, since the mother's reaction was to confront him, it might have been an effective way to get him to take responsibility, even if it caused tension.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a last resort to address a critical problem. While involving family without prior discussion might not be ideal, the necessity to protect the child's well-being justifies her actions. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
