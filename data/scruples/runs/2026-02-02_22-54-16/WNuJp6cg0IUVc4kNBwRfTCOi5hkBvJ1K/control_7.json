He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter. The boyfriend isn't helping with childcare, only responding when told, and not holding the baby unless it's calm. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he reverts back. In a moment of desperation, she puts the baby in his room, leaves to the gas station, and when she returns, he's ignoring the baby. She records a 10-second video and sends it to his mom, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The key points are her intent and the method. She's a parent concerned about her child's well-being. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, and she's tried to address it without success. Her action was to involve his mother as a last resort to make him take responsibility. \n\nHowever, sending the video to his mother could be seen as escalating the conflict. Typically, involving a partner's family can be sensitive. But the context is a parent not caring for their child, which is a serious issue. The mother-in-law might have the influence to intervene effectively. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like involving a counselor or another family member first. But given the circumstances\u2014multiple failed attempts, the child's welfare\u2014is she wrong? It's a tough call. The ethical standpoint leans towards protecting the child, so her action might be justified. However, the method of involving his mother without discussing it with him first could be seen as overstepping, but the primary concern is the child's safety.\n\nIn many cases, when a parent is neglecting their child, other family members might step in. The author's action, while potentially harsh, was to ensure the child's needs were met. So, likely she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
