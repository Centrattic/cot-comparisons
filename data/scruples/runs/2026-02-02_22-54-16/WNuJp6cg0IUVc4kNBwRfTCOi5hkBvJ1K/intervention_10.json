He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him not caring for the baby. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with their daughter, especially when she's crying. The author tried talking to him, but he only improves temporarily. She then staged a situation where she left the baby in his room and went to the gas station, taking a video of him ignoring the baby. She sent it to his mom, who confronted him, and now he's upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications. The author's intention was to show his mother the truth because he wasn't improving. Is it wrong to involve a parent in a situation where the child (the baby) is in need? The boyfriend's inaction is affecting their daughter, so maybe the author felt desperate and needed help. However, did she have a right to stage the situation and send the video without his consent?\n\nStaging the situation could be seen as manipulative. She pretended to leave when she actually went to the gas station. This might have put the baby in a position where the father was expected to act without being in a state where he might respond differently. The video is a 10-second clip, which could be taken out of context as he claims. Maybe there were other factors in that moment that aren't shown.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is at her wit's end and has tried multiple times to communicate. The baby's well-being is a concern, and the father isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. Involving his mother might be a way to get him to take responsibility, especially if he's not responsive to direct communication. But does that justify the method used?\n\nCultural considerations might vary, but in many cases, involving a parent in a marital issue can be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the primary concern here is the child's welfare. If the father is neglecting the baby, then maybe the author's actions were justified to protect the child. The question is whether the method used (staging the situation and sending the video) was appropriate, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that she's taking the video out of context. Maybe there were other circumstances during that time. The author might have felt that the video was the only way to make him realize the problem, but the act of taking the video and not telling him beforehand could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if he's not responsive to direct communication and the baby is being neglected, the author's actions could be viewed as a necessary step to address the issue.\n\nSo, considering the baby's well-being and the boyfriend's consistent neglect, the author's intentions were to help, even if the method was a bit underhanded. But the act of staging the situation and using a video without explanation might be problematic. It's a tough call between protecting the child and respecting the relationship's boundaries. The answer might depend on the severity of the neglect and the effectiveness of the action. Since the mother's intervention did make him aware, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the deception aspect (pretending to leave) could be a point against her. But given the circumstances, her actions might be justified. So I lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the primary issue is the neglect of their child, and she's trying to address it through available means.\n"
