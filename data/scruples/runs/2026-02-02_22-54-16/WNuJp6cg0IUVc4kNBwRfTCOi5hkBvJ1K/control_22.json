He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and after a gas station incident, she sent a 10-second video to his mom. The boyfriend is upset about involving his mom and the video being out of context.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the boyfriend's behavior towards the baby. He's not helping, only when prompted, and the author is exhausted. She tried talking to him, but he reverts after a week. She tried leaving the baby with him and sent a video when he ignored the baby. His mom called him out, and now he's angry at her for tattling.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, in terms of ethics, maybe she's trying to get help because the situation is serious. The baby's well-being is at risk. However, involving the mother could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust, depending on their relationship dynamics. The boyfriend might feel that his mother was used as a weapon against him, which can be hurtful. \n\nBut let's weigh the options. The mother did call him out, and the video was a direct example. The author's actions were to protect the baby's needs and her own mental health. If the boyfriend isn't responsive to direct communication, using external pressure might be necessary. However, there's a line about how to handle conflicts in a relationship. Maybe she should have tried other methods first, like couples counseling or involving other support systems. But given the severity of the situation\u2014neglect of an infant\u2014the urgency might justify her actions. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is valid in that involving his mother could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the mother's reaction might have been the right response because the father's behavior was harmful. The balance here is between the immediate need to protect the child and the respect for the relationship between the boyfriend and his mother. \n\nIn many cases, when there's a risk of child neglect, external parties (like family) might step in. The author's action could be justified as a desperate measure to ensure the child's safety. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, because she's trying to protect the baby and her own well-being in a stressful situation.\n"
