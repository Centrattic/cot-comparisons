He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who's been together for five years, and since their daughter was born six months ago, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. He's playing video games, only taking care of the baby when she's screaming if the author tells him to. He doesn't hold the baby unless she's calm and he's watching TV. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, even threatening to leave, but he keeps going back to his old behavior.\n\nThen, the author decides to put the baby in his gaming room and tell him she's leaving. She goes to the gas station and returns to find the baby crying and the boyfriend ignoring her. She takes a 10-second video and sends it to his mom. The mom calls him and yells at him, and now the boyfriend is upset with the author for involving his mom and saying the video was out of context.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending the video to his mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's behavior. He's not helping with the baby, which is a significant responsibility. The author has tried multiple times to address it, and there's no real change. The author is exhausted and considering divorce. Putting the baby in his room as a test might be a last resort. Taking a video as evidence and showing his mom could be seen as trying to get support, but maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author's actions might be justified as a way to protect the child and hold her partner accountable. However, involving the mother could be seen as meddling or not giving her son privacy. The key is whether the author's actions were necessary and appropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that the video was taken out of context. Maybe the author didn't explain the full situation, leading to the mom misunderstanding. But the author's intent was to show the neglect, which is a valid concern. However, the method of confronting the issue by involving the mother might have been a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is trying to protect her child and hold her partner responsible, which is understandable. But in terms of relationship dynamics, going to his mother without his consent could be seen as overstepping. However, given the severity of the neglect, some might argue it's a necessary step. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the author's actions could be seen as justified given the neglect of their child. On the other hand, using a parent in this way might not be the best approach. But considering the context of parental neglect and the author's attempts to resolve it without success, sending the video might not be her fault. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
