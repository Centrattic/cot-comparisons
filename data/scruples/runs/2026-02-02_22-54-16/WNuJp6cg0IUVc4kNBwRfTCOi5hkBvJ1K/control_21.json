He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a parent dealing with a boyfriend who isn't helping with their newborn daughter. They've been together five years, and since the baby was born six months ago, the relationship has deteriorated. The boyfriend refuses to care for the baby, only helps when the author tells him to, and he's more interested in gaming. The author tried to get him to change by threatening to leave and then actually went to a gas station, came back to find the baby crying and the boyfriend ignoring her. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. Now the boyfriend is upset, thinking she tattled on him and took the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend's lack of involvement in childcare. The author has tried talking about it multiple times, but he doesn't follow through unless forced. The breaking point was when she went out and came back to find the baby crying and the boyfriend not helping. She recorded a short video and sent it to his mother. His mom called him out, leading to conflict with the boyfriend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend's behavior is concerning. As a parent, he's not fulfilling his responsibilities, which is affecting the well-being of the child and the relationship. The author is under a lot of stress, possibly sleep-deprived, and dealing with the challenges of a newborn. Her actions were likely driven by desperation to make him take the situation seriously. Sending the video to his mother could be seen as a way to get support or escalate the issue when direct communication failed.\n\nOn the other hand, involving the boyfriend's mother might be seen as interfering in their relationship. People might argue that the author should have handled it between the two of them without involving family members. Also, taking a video could be seen as an invasion of privacy or manipulating the situation by editing or shortening the footage to make his actions look worse. The boyfriend's reaction that the video was out of context suggests that there might be more to the situation that the author didn't account for, which could mean her approach was unfair.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's primary concern is the baby's welfare. If the boyfriend is neglecting the child, that's a serious issue. The author's actions might be justified as a last resort to ensure the child is being cared for. However, the method of involving his mother could be problematic because it's not a typical way to address such issues and might have strained family relationships unnecessarily. Still, given the severity of the neglect, some might argue that the ends justify the means.\n\nAlso, the author mentions considering divorce and being at her wit's end. This shows that she's been dealing with this for a while and has tried multiple approaches without success. The fact that the boyfriend's behavior regresses each time he promises to improve adds to the frustration. In such cases, people might empathize with the author's decision to involve family to get the message across.\n\nHowever, using a video as evidence and sending it to his mother might not be the best approach. It could be seen as a betrayal of trust or a lack of privacy. But if the alternative is the child being neglected, the author's action might be seen as necessary to protect the child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might argue that involving in-laws in such matters is inappropriate, but others might see it as a legitimate step when the parent is not acting responsibly. The key here is whether the author's actions were in the best interest of the child. If the video accurately shows the neglect, then her action is understandable. If the video was misleading, then she's in the wrong.\n\nThe problem is that the boyfriend claims the video is out of context. Without seeing the full context, it's hard to say, but the author's explanation might have provided enough context for the mother to understand. However, the act of sending a short video snippet might not capture the full scenario, leading to possible misinterpretation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to address the boyfriend's neglect, the method of involving his mother might be questionable. However, given the severity of the situation and the lack of resolution through direct communication, some might argue she's not in the wrong. Others might think she should have handled it differently. Considering the options, the author's actions were a desperate measure to protect the child, so she's not entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
