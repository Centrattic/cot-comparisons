He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is about a strained relationship after having a baby, with the boyfriend not helping with childcare. The author tried various things, like talking to him and even faking a departure, but he didn't change. She took a video of him ignoring the baby and sent it to his mom, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author has tried multiple times to address it, and he's shown improvement temporarily but then relapsed. She felt desperate and didn't trust him, so she took action to get help from his mother. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Did she have a right to involve the mother? Was the video taken in a deceptive way (faking leaving)? Is it justified to use such a tactic when the child's well-being is at stake? Also, the boyfriend is upset because she involved his mom and took the video, which he sees as out of context.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mother-in-law might have a duty to intervene if her son isn't taking care of the baby. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort to protect the child. However, involving family without the partner's consent can be seen as crossing a boundary. The deception part (faking leaving) adds another layer, as she didn't go through with leaving, which might be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut the core issue is the neglect of the child. If the boyfriend is not stepping up, the author has a responsibility to ensure the baby's needs are met. The video serves as evidence of his neglect. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to protect the child, which is a strong justification. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel disrespected by having his mother involved and the video, which could damage trust. However, if he's not taking care of his child, the mother's actions could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being. \n\nSo weighing the options, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the primary concern is the child's welfare, and she's taking steps to address his neglect despite the interpersonal issues it causes.\n"
