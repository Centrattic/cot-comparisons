He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote this post (AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter, and they sent a video to his mother after a tense situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has a daughter, and the boyfriend isn't participating in childcare. The user says he plays video games, only helps when the baby is crying if she tells him, and doesn't hold the baby unless she hands her over. They've had multiple conversations about this, and he sometimes improves but then goes back. The user tried a tactic by leaving the baby in his room and then going to the gas station. When she returned, the baby was crying and he wasn't helping. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom with an explanation. His mom called him and reamed him, and now he's upset with the user for involving his mom and \"taking a video out of context.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the ethical aspects. The user is dealing with a serious issue: her partner is neglecting their child, which is a major concern. She's trying to address this by involving his mother, which could be seen as a step, but maybe not the best way to handle it. However, the situation is about child care, which is critical. The user is in a vulnerable position, possibly feeling isolated and desperate. \n\nOn one hand, the user could be wrong because she didn't try to resolve the issue directly with her partner first, but they've already had multiple discussions. She did attempt to get him to change, and when that failed, she took this action. Sending a video to the boyfriend's mother might be seen as an overstep, especially if the mother wasn't initially involved. However, the user's actions were motivated by concern for the baby's well-being. \n\nBut then, is there a better way? Maybe she should have involved other supports first, like counseling or a family therapist. But given the situation, she might feel that time is running out and the baby's needs aren't being met. The fact that the mother called him out and he's now upset with her adds another layer. The user's action might be justified if she's trying to protect the baby and hold the father accountable. \n\nHowever, the method of involving his mother without his consent could be problematic. It's possible that this caused more harm by creating a rift between them and possibly not solving the core issue. But if the father is negligent, the user's actions could be seen as a necessary step to ensure the child's safety. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" dynamics, the community often looks at intentions and the seriousness of the issue. Since the well-being of a child is at stake, the user's actions might be justified despite the method. The fact that the mother's intervention had an immediate effect (the father being reamed) suggests that it worked, but the user now faces backlash. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user's primary concern was the child's welfare, and she took action after repeated failures to resolve the issue directly. However, others might argue that she should have handled it differently. But given the severity of the situation (child neglect), the user's actions could be seen as understandable and necessary, hence not in the wrong.\n"
