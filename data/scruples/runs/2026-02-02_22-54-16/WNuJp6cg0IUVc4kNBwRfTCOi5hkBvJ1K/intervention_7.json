He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their baby to his mother. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a 6-month-old daughter, and the boyfriend isn't helping with childcare. He's playing video games instead, only helping when the baby is screaming and even then, he's passive. They've discussed this multiple times, and the boyfriend's behavior hasn't improved. The author tried leaving the baby in his room and recording a video when he ignored her. She sent it to his mom, who then confronted him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether sending the video to his mother is justified or not. The author's intention was to get his mother to help change his behavior. The boyfriend is upset because he feels the video was taken out of context. But from the author's perspective, she's exhausted and feels like she's the only one taking care of the baby.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. On one hand, the author is doing what she can to protect her child and address a serious issue. On the other hand, going to his mother might be seen as involving family in their private matters, which could be a breach of trust. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014neglect of a child\u2014it's a matter of concern that might justify taking such a step. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, and the author is trying to hold him accountable. \n\nThe key points are the well-being of the child and the boyfriend's consistent refusal to help despite multiple attempts to communicate. The act of sending the video was a last resort after all else failed. The author's actions were aimed at ensuring the child's needs were met, which is a strong justification. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
