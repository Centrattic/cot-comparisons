He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mother. The situation involves the boyfriend not helping with their newborn daughter. The key points here are the boyfriend's behavior, the author's actions, and the resulting fallout.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend isn't contributing as a parent. He's playing video games and ignoring the baby's needs unless prompted, then even asking why she can't handle it. This is a significant issue, especially post-birth, when both parents should be sharing the load. The author has tried communicating multiple times, even to the point of threatening to leave, but there's no lasting change. \n\nThen, the author decides to stage a situation where she leaves the baby in his room and takes a video when he ignores her. She sends this to his mom, leading to the mom confronting him. Now, the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mother and taking the video out of context. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, involving his mother isn't ideal because it's their private matter. However, considering the severity of the situation\u2014neglecting a newborn\u2014maybe the author felt it was necessary. The video serves as evidence of the neglect, which his mother used to ream him. The author's intention was likely to make him take responsibility, which she might have felt she couldn't do alone.\n\nBut there's a difference between involving family and the actual neglect. If the boyfriend is truly neglecting the child, then the author isn't in the wrong for trying to get help. However, the method might be questionable. Was there a better way? Maybe, but given that all previous attempts failed, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's upset about the video being taken and the mother being involved. But he's the one who's not fulfilling his parental duties. The author's actions, while perhaps not the most ideal, were in the best interest of the child.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the core issue here. The answer is B.\n"
