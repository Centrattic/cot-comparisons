He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The question is about whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 5 years, had a baby 6 months ago. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, plays video games, only helps when told and even then expects the author to do it if she's busy. The author tried talking, he improves for a week then goes back. She put the baby in his room, went to the gas station, came back, baby was crying and he was ignoring. She took a video, sent it to his mom. Now he's upset with her for involving her mom and the video being out of context.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's intent was to make the boyfriend take responsibility. She's clearly exhausted and desperate. Her actions were to get his mother involved, which is a form of external pressure. In some cultures, involving parents in personal matters isn't common and can be seen as overstepping. However, the situation is about child care, which is a serious matter. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is neglecting the baby, which is a significant issue. The author tried multiple times to resolve it without involving others. The act of sending the video to his mother might be seen as tattling, but it's also a response to ongoing neglect of a child. \n\nThe mom's reaction was to confront the boyfriend, which may have led to change, but the boyfriend is now upset at her. The question is if the author is wrong. In many cases, people might see her as protecting the child and seeking support, especially if the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility. However, the method of involving his mother without his consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nBut if the child's well-being is at stake, her actions might be justified. The key points are the boyfriend's neglect, multiple failed attempts to resolve, and the urgency of the situation. The video is evidence of the neglect, which might be necessary to show the mother. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are more in the right because she's trying to protect the child. But if the boyfriend's mother was the only person to approach, maybe she should have talked to him first. However, given that he's not responding to her, maybe she had no choice. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider the severity of the issue. Since it's about child care and the boyfriend's inaction, the author is likely not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
