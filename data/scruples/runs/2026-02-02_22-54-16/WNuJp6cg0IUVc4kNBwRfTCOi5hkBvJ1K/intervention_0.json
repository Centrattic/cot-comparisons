He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. So, the situation is that the couple has a newborn, and the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby. The author tried talking, but he doesn't change. She did a test where she left, came back, and found him ignoring the crying baby. Then she recorded a 10-second video and sent it to his mom, which led to the mom scolding him. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are justified. The main issue here is the boyfriend's lack of responsibility with their child. The author is the primary caregiver, which is causing her significant stress. She's tried multiple times to address the issue without success. The test she set up\u2014putting the baby in his room and leaving\u2014seems like a reasonable way to see if he would actually take care of the baby on his own. When he failed, the video serves as evidence of his neglect.\n\nBut is it right to involve the mother? In some cultures, involving in-laws can be seen as overstepping. However, in this case, the mother might have the influence to make him take responsibility. The author might have felt that this was the last resort after all other methods failed. The video is short, so it's not like she sent a long, potentially misleading clip. She also provided an explanation, so the context was included.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have addressed it directly with him first without involving family. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since he's not taking responsibility and the child's well-being is at stake, her actions could be seen as justified to protect the baby. The boyfriend's reaction about taking the video out of context might be a deflection from his actual behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She took a necessary step to ensure her child's care and to confront her partner's inaction, even if it involved family. The answer should be B (No).\n"
