He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video of her boyfriend ignoring their crying baby to his mother.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, which is causing major stress. The author has tried talking to him multiple times, but he keeps going back to his old behavior. She even staged a scenario where she left the baby with him and took a video when he ignored her. She sent it to his mom, and now he's upset with her.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, the key points here are the context of the situation and the intent behind her actions. The mother-in-law called him out, which probably helped, but the boyfriend is now upset about being tattled on. The author's main issue is that her partner isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious matter. The baby's well-being is at stake here. \n\nShe tried to handle it on her own first by talking to him, but he didn't change. So she escalated by involving his mother. While some might argue that she should have handled it differently, like involving a professional or legal steps, others might see her actions as a last resort to get help. Sending the video was a direct way to show the mother-in-law what's happening. \n\nHowever, the method she used\u2014staging the situation and taking a video without his knowledge\u2014could be seen as deceptive. That might be where she's in the wrong. But given the severity of the issue (a child's welfare), some might argue that her intentions were justified. It's a tricky balance between privacy and child welfare. \n\nIn terms of accountability, she's in a tough spot. She's trying to protect her child and herself from an uncooperative partner. The fact that he's not stepping up when the baby is crying is a red flag for neglect. The mother-in-law's reaction shows that the video had an impact, which is what she needed to get help. \n\nSo, while the method might be questionable, the intent was to address a serious problem. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. But others might see the deception as wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the circumstances, B (not in the wrong) might be the better answer.\n"
