He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a parent with a newborn daughter, and their boyfriend isn't helping. The boyfriend refuses to take care of the baby, plays video games instead, and only helps when the author tells him. They've talked about this multiple times, but he keeps going back to the same behavior. The author tried a last-ditch effort by putting the baby in his room and leaving to the gas station. When she came back, the baby was crying and he was ignoring it. She took a 10-second video and sent it to his mom. Now the boyfriend is upset with her for involving his mom and the video.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling his parental duties, which is a serious issue. The author feels at her wits' end and is considering divorce. She took action to involve his mother as a last resort. But was that the right move?\n\nInvolving a parent in a conflict between a couple can be seen as crossing a boundary. Normally, couples are expected to resolve their own issues. However, when it comes to the well-being of a child, the stakes are higher. The author might have felt that the baby's safety and proper care were at risk. By sending the video to his mother, she's trying to get support to make him realize the seriousness of his behavior. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is that she took the video out of context. Maybe he's worried about the video being misinterpreted or that the situation wasn't as bad as shown. However, the author's account suggests that this was a consistent pattern, not an isolated incident. The video was just one example of many.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The boyfriend is neglecting his parental responsibilities. 2) The author tried to address it but failed. 3) She took a step to involve his mother as a last resort. \n\nIs sending the video to his mom justified? On one hand, she's trying to protect her child and hold him accountable. On the other hand, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as violating trust. However, given the severity of the situation\u2014potential child neglect\u2014the action might be considered justifiable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners have a duty to care for their child. The boyfriend's inaction is a significant problem. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are a response to that inaction. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the welfare of the child is paramount. However, there's also a consideration of whether involving his mother was the right approach. But given the context, the author's intent was to address neglect, which is serious enough that the action might be understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
