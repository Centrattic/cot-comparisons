He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom. The situation is that the boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, and she's at her breaking point. She took a video when she left and sent it to his mom, which resulted in the mom reaming him out. Now he's upset with her for involving his mom and taking the video out of context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The couple has been together five years, and post-baby, the boyfriend isn't participating in childcare. The author is handling all the baby's needs, which is leading to her considering divorce. She tried multiple times to address the issue without success. The last attempt was staging a situation to show him the consequences, which she documented and sent to his mother. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's behavior, the author's actions, and the consequences. The boyfriend is neglecting his responsibilities, which is a significant problem, especially with a newborn. The author felt she couldn't trust him, so she staged a situation to demonstrate his neglect. Taking a 10-second video as evidence might be seen as a way to show the reality of the situation. Sending it to his mother could be seen as seeking support, but it might also be seen as violating privacy or involving family unnecessarily.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a distressing situation where her partner isn't fulfilling his responsibilities. She's tried communication, which didn't work, and felt she needed to take action. The video was a direct example of his neglect. However, using a family member as a mediator without consent might be crossing a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is also important\u2014feeling that the video was taken out of context could imply that the situation might not be as clear-cut as she presented it. \n\nBut considering the context of ongoing neglect and the author's efforts to resolve the issue without success, her actions might be justified as a last resort to protect the child and herself. The mother-in-law's reaction might have been the consequence she intended to provoke, given that the father wasn't responding to her directly. However, involving his mother without his consent could be seen as manipulative, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's behavior is inexcusable. Neglecting a child is a serious matter, and the author has a right to seek help if she's in a vulnerable situation. The video serves as evidence of the problem, which she couldn't resolve herself. The ethical dilemma here is between respecting boundaries versus protecting the child. Since domestic situations can be complex, but the father's behavior is clearly harmful, the mother's actions might be understandable.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's in a dire situation and took a drastic step after exhausting other options. While involving the mother might not be the best approach, the primary fault lies with the father's neglect, not her actions.\n"
