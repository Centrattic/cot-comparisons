He\u2019ll sit on the couch and play video games and he\u2019ll only tend to her while she\u2019s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I\u2019m in the middle of doing something right then, he\u2019ll ask me why I can\u2019t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he\u2019s watching tv and she\u2019s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won\u2019t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We\u2019ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I\u2019ve told him I can\u2019t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly considering filing for divorce but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was leaving. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what\u2019s going on.\n\nShe called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he\u2019s upset with me for involving his mother and for \u201ctaking a video out of context.\u201d I\u2019m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a video to her boyfriend's mom about him neglecting their baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend isn't helping with the baby, despite multiple conversations. The author tried a last-ditch effort by leaving to get gas, then sent a video of him ignoring the crying baby to his mom. The mom called him out, and now he's upset with the author.\n\nSo, the key points are: the baby's well-being, the boyfriend's consistent neglect, and the author's actions to involve family. The author is in a tough spot, trying to protect the child and seek help. But did she overstep by involving the mother? In some cultures or families, involving parents might be seen as inappropriate, but when a child's safety is at risk, it's a different matter. The boyfriend's behavior could be considered neglectful, so the author might feel justified in taking action. However, using a video as evidence and going to the mother might have breached trust. The boyfriend's reaction about the video being out of context could matter. If the video was short and selective, maybe it's misleading. But the author's intent was to show neglect. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The author's primary concern is the child's welfare, which is crucial. The boyfriend's lack of responsibility is a significant issue. The question is whether the author's method was the right one. While sending the video might not be the best approach, her intent was to get help. So, I think she's not in the wrong (B), but it's a close call.\n"
