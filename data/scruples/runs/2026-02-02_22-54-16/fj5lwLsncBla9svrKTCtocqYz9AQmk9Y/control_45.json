Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they saw two people cheating in an exam and reported it to the professor. The friends are divided on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it undermines academic integrity. By reporting the cheaters, the author is upholding the rules set by the institution. The professor is the one who deals with the consequences, like failing the class. So, from that angle, the author did the right thing because they're maintaining fairness for the rest of the class. The curve being affected is a real concern because if those two people cheat, it could unfairly lower grades for others.\n\nBut then there's the other side. Some people might think that cheating is a problem, but maybe they believe the author should have handled it differently or not at all. However, the author did the reporting discreetly and let the professor handle the situation, which seems appropriate. The professor was watching them and caught them, so the author's action directly led to the cheaters getting what they deserved.\n\nAnother point is the potential stress on the cheaters. But cheating is their choice, and the consequences are part of the university's policies. The author isn't punishing them; they're just reporting a violation of rules. The professor is the one who enforces the penalties. So, the author isn't taking matters into their own hands but following the proper procedure.\n\nAlso, the method of reporting was clever\u2014using the restroom excuse to discreetly inform the professor. That's a good way to avoid confrontation and ensure the professor can handle it without disruption. The professor's response was to monitor and then act, which worked out. The cheaters got their tests confiscated and were taken out, which aligns with the university's anti-cheating policies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They acted within the rules and helped preserve academic integrity without overstepping their role.\n"
