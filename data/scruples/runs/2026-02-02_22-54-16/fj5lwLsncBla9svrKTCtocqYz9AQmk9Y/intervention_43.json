Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. The story is from a university setting. The author noticed someone with notecards and another looking over a friend's shoulder. They wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse, gave the note to the professor, who then handled it and caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is a serious academic offense, so reporting it can be seen as upholding academic integrity. The professor did take action, so the author's action led to justice. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently or that the cheaters might have had reasons. But the key points are the immediate action to report and the professor's involvement. The professor is responsible for enforcing rules, so the author's method of informing her was necessary to prevent further cheating. Friends have conflicting opinions, but the main issue is the author's responsibility versus the cheaters' actions. Since the professor confirmed she would take care of it, the author did the right thing. So the answer should be B.\n"
