Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that they noticed two students using notecards and peeking at others' tests, so they wrote a note to the professor during the exam, went to the restroom, and the professor then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. Cheating is against academic integrity policies, so reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do. The professor did take action, which means the cheaters were held accountable. The person reporting used a clever but non-confrontational method, which might be necessary in a formal setting like an exam where direct confrontation isn't possible.\n\nSome friends think they did the right thing because cheating is unfair. Others say it's wrong because school is hard, but that's more about the cheaters' excuses. The person reporting didn't cheat themselves; they just informed the professor. The action was discreet and effective, leading to the cheaters being caught. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the person overstepped by writing a note instead of directly telling the professor during the exam. However, in an exam setting, students can't easily approach the professor during the test. The restroom method seems like a practical workaround to bring attention without disrupting the exam. \n\nAlso, the outcome was that the cheaters failed the class, which is a consequence of the school's policy. The reporter's action was in line with maintaining fairness. There's no indication of malice or personal vendetta here; it was about upholding academic standards.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B. The person isn't in the wrong because they reported cheating appropriately, following the correct procedures, and ensuring academic integrity.\n"
