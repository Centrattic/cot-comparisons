Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario is from a university setting, so academic integrity policies probably play a role here.\n\nFirst, the person noticed someone with notecards and then saw them peeking at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then handled it, caught them in the act, and they failed. \n\nNow, the user is getting mixed reactions from friends. Some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's wrong because school is tough. The key points here are about academic honesty and the responsibility of students to report misconduct.\n\nUniversities usually have clear policies about cheating. Students are often expected to uphold academic integrity, which includes reporting violations. So, from that perspective, the person did what they were supposed to do. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal ethics. Some might argue that everyone makes mistakes, especially under stress, and that being lenient is better. But in a formal setting like an exam, the rules are strict. Cheating undermines the system and fairness for others. \n\nThe person didn't confront them directly but discreetly informed the professor, which is the proper procedure. The professor then took action, which is standard. The person's actions prevented unfair advantage, which is in line with most academic policies. \n\nOn the flip side, could there be a case for being too harsh? Maybe if there was a misunderstanding, but the evidence here seems clear: notecards and looking at another's test are clear violations. \n\nSo, considering the academic standpoint and the procedures followed, the person isn't in the wrong. They upheld the integrity of the exam process. The answer should be B (No).\n"
