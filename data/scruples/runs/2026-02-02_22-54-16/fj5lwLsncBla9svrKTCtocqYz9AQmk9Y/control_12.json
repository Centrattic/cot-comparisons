Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam was wrong. The situation involves two students who were caught cheating after the author anonymously informed the professor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the academic integrity policies typical of universities. Cheating is a serious offense, and most institutions have clear rules against it. If the professor confirmed the cheating, then the students involved would indeed face consequences like failing the class. The author's action here was to report the cheating, which is usually encouraged to maintain fairness.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by ratting out peers, especially if the friends are close. However, the author did it discreetly, without confrontation, which shows they were trying to be responsible without causing a scene. The professor handled it professionally, so the outcome was appropriate.\n\nOthers might say that school is hard and cheating happens for various reasons, but the rules are in place for a reason. By not cheating yourself and reporting those who do, you're upholding standards. The author didn't cheat; they just acted to prevent unfair advantages that could affect the class curve.\n\nThe friends' divided opinions reflect common dilemmas. Some see integrity as crucial, others prioritize solidarity. But in academic settings, integrity is usually the priority. The author's method was respectful and effective, leading to the professor taking action. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
