Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The scenario is a university setting. The person noticed notecards under someone's test, saw them signaling another student, and then reported it discreetly by writing a note and using the restroom as an excuse. The professor then took action and caught them. The person is being criticized by friends for either being a snitch or doing the right thing.\n\nLegally and academically, universities usually have policies against cheating. Reporting cheating is often considered a responsible action to maintain academic integrity. However, social dynamics can make people question if it's right to report peers. The person here didn't confront the cheaters directly, which avoids public humiliation, and they did it in a way that let the professor handle it, which is the proper channel.\n\nSome might argue that in a tough academic environment, cheating is common and that the reporter is being too harsh. Others would say that cheating undermines the system and that everyone should report it. The key points here are that the action was taken discreetly and through the appropriate authority, which is the professor. The person didn't act out of spite but to uphold academic standards.\n\nThe friends' divided opinions are typical. Friends might feel conflicted between loyalty and integrity. However, the university's stance on cheating is usually strict. The person's action likely prevented unfair advantage and ensured a fair process. The professor's response (taking the cheaters outside) indicates that the system worked as intended.\n\nSo, considering the ethical and institutional rules, the person is not in the wrong. They followed the proper procedure without escalating the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
