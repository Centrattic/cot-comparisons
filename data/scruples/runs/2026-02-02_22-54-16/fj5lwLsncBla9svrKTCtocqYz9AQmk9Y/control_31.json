Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating in an exam was wrong. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person noticed cheating, wrote a note, discreetly told the professor, and the professor took action. The class had around 30 students, so cheating could affect the curve. The consequences for cheating are automatic failure.\n\nNow, ethical implications. Reporting cheating is generally seen as doing the right thing because it upholds academic integrity. Cheating undermines fair assessment and can give an unfair advantage. The person didn't confront them directly, which might prevent an escalation or argument. They went through the proper channel (the professor), which is the correct procedure in academic settings.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the person is being a \"rat,\" especially if the cheaters had valid reasons for stress. But the scenario mentions that the exam was hard, and cheating is against the rules regardless of difficulty. The professor handled it, so the person didn't take matters into their own hands. The action was discreet and followed protocol.\n\nFriends have conflicting opinions, but the key factor is whether the person acted within the rules. Since they reported it through the professor, it seems appropriate. The cheaters got caught and faced consequences, which is fair. The person isn't at fault here because they're maintaining academic standards. So the answer should be B (not wrong).\n"
