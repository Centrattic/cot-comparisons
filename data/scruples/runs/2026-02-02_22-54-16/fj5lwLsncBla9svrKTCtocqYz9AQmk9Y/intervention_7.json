Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two classmates cheating on a final exam. The situation is that during the exam, the person noticed someone had notecards and was looking at another's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor later caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, cheating is wrong, and reporting it maintains academic integrity. The professor did take action, confirming the cheaters were caught. The writer acted to uphold the rules, which is a responsible action.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the writer was being a tattletale, but the friends' opinions are mixed. Some say it's right because cheating is bad, others think it's harsh. The key points here are the consequences: the cheaters might fail, but the writer didn't directly harm them beyond reporting. The method was discreet, which could be seen as smart to avoid confrontation.\n\nAlso, in an academic setting, professors often encourage reporting misconduct. The writer's action prevented unfair advantage, which could affect the class curve. So, from an academic honesty standpoint, the writer did the right thing. However, some might feel it's meddling, but given the scenario, the writer's intent seems to be about fairness rather than personal gain.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
