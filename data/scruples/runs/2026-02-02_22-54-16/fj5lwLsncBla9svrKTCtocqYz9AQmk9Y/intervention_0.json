Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is they saw two people cheating during a final exam and reported them to the professor. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong. The user thinks the author isn't at fault, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Cheating is typically a serious offense, so the professor is responsible for handling it. If the author reported the cheating, they were following the rules. But maybe there's a way to handle it without directly reporting? Like telling the professor in person instead of writing a note and using the bathroom as an excuse. But the author did go to the professor, so maybe the method was a bit sneaky, but the intent was to report cheating.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. Cheating affects the fairness for others, especially in a small class where the curve matters. The author might be protecting the integrity of the test. On the other hand, some might argue that it's harsh to ruin someone's semester, but the professor decides the consequences, not the student.\n\nThe key points: Did the author act according to university policies? Did they have a valid reason to report? Since the professor confirmed she handled it, the action was appropriate. Friends being divided shows differing opinions, but the main thing is whether the action was justified. I think the author did the right thing by reporting the cheating, even if their method was a bit underhanded. The professor is the authority here, so the student's role is to inform them. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
