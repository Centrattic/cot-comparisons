Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two classmates for cheating. The scenario is a university final exam where the author noticed someone with notecards and then saw them leaning over to look at another student's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then handled the situation, and the cheaters didn't return. Friends are divided on whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and academic integrity aspects. Cheating is a serious offense in academic settings. Most universities have policies against it, and reporting cheating is often encouraged to maintain fairness. The author didn't just accuse them publicly; they discreetly informed the professor, which is the proper procedure. The professor then took action, leading to the cheaters being caught. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was being a \"snitch\" or that the cheaters were just trying to cope with a hard exam. However, the consequences of cheating, like automatic failure, are standard in many institutions. The author's action ensured that the academic standards were upheld. \n\nThe friends' mixed reactions highlight the social dynamics involved. Some see it as a duty, others as betrayal. But academically, the right action is to report cheating. The author didn't act out of malice; they observed the action and reported it through the appropriate channel. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Was the author certain they were cheating? The notecards and looking at another's test are strong indicators. The professor confirmed the violation, so the author's report was accurate. Also, the method of reporting was discreet, which is better than public confrontation. \n\nSo, the consensus would likely be that the author was not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
