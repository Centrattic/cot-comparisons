Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam where the person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's papers. They wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse, and gave the info to the professor. The professor then caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university regarding cheating. If the policy states that students should report cheating, then the person did the right thing. On the other hand, some might argue that it's not their responsibility to police others, especially in a high-pressure situation like finals.\n\nThe person's friends are split. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's wrong because school is hard. But the automatic failure for cheating is a strong point. If the professor handles it, the cheaters get what they deserve. The key here is whether the reporter acted within the guidelines. They didn't confront the students directly, just informed the professor, which seems appropriate. Also, the professor was already monitoring and confirmed the cheating, so the consequence is justified.\n\nPotential issues: Maybe the person didn't have concrete evidence? But they saw the notecards and the action of looking at another's test. That's observable cheating. So the report was based on facts. No lying involved. The method of reporting was discreet, which is good to avoid personal confrontation.\n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong. They followed the correct procedure by informing the professor, leading to the cheating being addressed. The answer should be B (No).\n"
