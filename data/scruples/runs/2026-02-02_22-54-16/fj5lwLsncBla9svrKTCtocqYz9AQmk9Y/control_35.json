Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The student noticed someone with notecards and then saw them looking at another person's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the restroom, and the professor handled it. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nIn academic settings, cheating is a serious offense. Professors usually have policies against it. The student here didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor discreetly. That seems responsible because the professor can address it without public confrontation. \n\nSome might argue that the student was overstepping, but the responsibility to maintain academic integrity is shared. By reporting, the student is upholding the rules. The alternative is letting cheating go unnoticed, which could affect grading for others. The professor did act on the information, so the student's action had a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, others might say that the student was being a \"ninja\" and that it's not their role to police others. But in an exam setting, where cheating is a violation, students are often encouraged to report it. The key here is that the student didn't retaliate or spread rumors but reported through the proper channel (the professor). \n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the professor had to act. The student's action led to that, which is fair. The friends' opinions are mixed, but the main factor is whether the action was against the rules. Since the professor handled it and the cheaters were caught, the student did the right thing. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
