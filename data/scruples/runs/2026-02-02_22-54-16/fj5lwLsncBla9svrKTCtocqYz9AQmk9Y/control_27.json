Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where two students are caught cheating. The reporter noticed notecards and saw them looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note to the professor, used the restroom as an excuse, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being removed.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. Cheating undermines academic integrity. If the professor's policy is strict, then cheating leads to failure. Reporting cheaters is often seen as upholding fairness. The person acted to prevent unfair advantage, which could affect the class curve. Friends have mixed opinions, but the key is the institution's rules and the person's role in maintaining them.\n\nWas there a breach of trust? Not really. The person wasn't involved in the cheaters' actions; they observed and reported. The professor dealt with it, so the person followed proper channels. The method was discreet, which is practical in an exam setting. No evidence of malice or personal gain\u2014just a sense of doing the right thing.\n\nArguments against: Some might say it's interfering, but in an academic setting, preventing cheating is encouraged. Others might argue it's gossip, but the professor was informed directly. The person didn't spread rumors; they provided evidence. Also, the cheaters faced consequences, which is fair.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether reporting cheating is a duty or a betrayal. Since the person acted to uphold academic integrity, they're likely not in the wrong. The professor handled it, so the person did what was necessary without overstepping.\n"
