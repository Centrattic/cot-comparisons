Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating during a final exam.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The exam was a university-level final, and the two students were caught cheating by having notecards and looking at another's test. The author noticed this, wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse to go to the professor, and then the professor intervened. The outcome was that the cheaters didn't finish the exam and likely failed.\n\nNow, the friends have conflicting opinions. Some say the author did the right thing because cheating is wrong and the cheaters deserved to fail. Others argue it's wrong because school is hard and cheating might have been a result of that.\n\nI need to evaluate the morality and ethics here. Cheating is typically a violation of academic integrity policies. Reporters are often encouraged to come forward in such cases. However, the method the author used\u2014writing a note and sneaking it via a bathroom break\u2014might be seen as underhanded, but it's also a strategic way to inform without direct confrontation. The professor handled the situation, which suggests the process was followed correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by not directly confronting the cheaters or letting the professor handle it without their interference. But in many academic settings, students are allowed to report academic dishonesty to uphold standards.\n\nThe key points are: the cheaters violated rules, the author took steps to inform the professor discreetly, and the professor acted on it. The author's intent was to maintain fairness, which is a valid reason. However, the act of \"ratting out\" can sometimes be seen as betrayal among peers. But in an academic context, integrity is usually prioritized.\n\nSo, considering the potential for cheating to affect grading fairness (especially the curve mentioned), and the fact that the professor dealt with it, the author's action aligns with maintaining academic standards. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
