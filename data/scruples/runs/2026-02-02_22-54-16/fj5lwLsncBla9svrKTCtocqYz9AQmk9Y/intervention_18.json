Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting two students for cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author noticed during a final exam that two students had notecards and were looking at each other's tests. The author wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse to get it to the professor, who then caught the cheaters. The friends are split on whether it's right or wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is academic integrity. Cheating is against university policies, so reporting it is usually expected. The author didn't confront them directly, which is important because that could have been disruptive. Instead, they discreetly informed the professor, which is a standard procedure. The professor then acted on the information, which is the proper way to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being a \"rat,\" but in academic settings, maintaining fairness is crucial. The curve for the class could be affected if those two did well, which might unfairly disadvantage others. The professor's role is to enforce rules, and the author provided necessary information. \n\nHowever, could there be a problem with the method? The author used a restroom break to pass the note, which is a bit sneaky, but in exams, students often have to leave for various reasons. As long as the information was truthful, the method doesn't make it wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the cheaters are responsible for their actions. The author is upholding the standards, not taking matters into their own hands. The professor handled the situation, so the author's role was as a witness. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have just focused on their own exam. But in cases of cheating, institutions usually encourage reporting to maintain fairness. Plus, the author didn't interfere during the exam, which is key. \n\nSo, considering academic integrity policies and the fact that the author followed proper channels, I think the right answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
