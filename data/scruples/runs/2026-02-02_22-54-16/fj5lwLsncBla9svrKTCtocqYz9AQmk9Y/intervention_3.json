Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who noticed cheating and reported it is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam. The key points here are: the person saw someone with notecards and leaned over to look at another's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor then caught them. Now friends are divided on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity. If the author didn't do anything, the cheaters would have an unfair advantage, possibly affecting the class curve. Reporting it upholds the rules. On the other hand, some might say it's a harsh consequence, but the professor's job is to enforce the rules.\n\nThe method the author used was discreet. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have been confrontational. Instead, they informed the professor, which is the proper channel. The professor then handled the situation. So the author followed the correct procedure. \n\nAcademic policies usually require students to report cheating. By doing so, the author is maintaining fairness. Even if friends are conflicted, the act itself is in line with university policies. The cheaters were caught and will face the consequences. The author's action is morally and ethically justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
