Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheaters in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university setting. The person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's tests. They informed the professor discreetly, which led to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing the class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of academic integrity. Most universities have strict policies against cheating. Reporting cheating is usually encouraged because it maintains fairness. The person here acted by informing the professor, which is the correct procedure. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have been disruptive. Instead, they used a note and a bathroom break to discreetly inform the professor. That seems responsible.\n\nBut some friends argued it was wrong because school is hard. However, cheating is a violation regardless of the difficulty. The professor's role is to enforce rules, so the student was just assisting in upholding academic standards. There's no indication the student acted out of malice. They had a concern about the curve affecting the class, which is valid if the professor uses curves. But the main duty is to report violations.\n\nAnother angle: Is there a risk of false accusations? The question doesn't mention any evidence that the student misinterpreted the situation. They observed notecards and saw the exchange, which are clear signs. The professor then confirmed their actions, leading to the cheaters being caught. So the report was accurate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say it's not the student's place to police others. But in academic settings, students are expected to report violations. The alternative is staying silent, which allows cheating to go unchecked. The action taken here is in line with institutional policies.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the student did the right thing by following the proper procedure to report cheating without causing a scene. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
