Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two people who were cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed someone had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another person's exam. The author wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught. The professor then confiscated their tests and they left.\n\nNow, considering the context: it's a university setting. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and the policy would likely require reporting such incidents. The author's actions prevented the cheaters from affecting the class curve if they did well, which helps maintain fairness. \n\nThe friends are divided. Some think the author did the right thing because cheating is wrong, others say it's wrong because school is hard and people make mistakes. But the professor's response shows that the action was appropriate, as she handled it. The cheaters faced consequences, which is part of academic integrity policies.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't confront the cheaters directly, which might have caused a scene. Instead, they used a discreet method to inform the professor, which is a responsible approach. The professor's reaction validates that the author did the right thing. The author's action preserves academic integrity, which is a key value in education. \n\nSome might argue that the author was being a \"rat,\" but in academic settings, reporting cheating is usually encouraged. Unless there were malicious intent or false accusations, the author isn't at fault. The scenario doesn't indicate any of that. The cheaters were indeed caught, so the author acted appropriately. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
