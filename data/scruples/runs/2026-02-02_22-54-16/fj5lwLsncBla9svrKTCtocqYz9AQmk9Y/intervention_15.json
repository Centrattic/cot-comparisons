Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario is from a university setting, and the person noticed two students cheating\u2014using notecards and looking at another's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and reporting it can be seen as upholding academic integrity. The person acted to prevent unfair advantage, which could affect the class curve. On the other hand, some might argue that it's a difficult situation and the cheaters might have been struggling, but the policy is clear against cheating here. \n\nThe method of reporting was discreet\u2014using a note and the restroom as an excuse. That shows they tried to handle it without confrontation, which is commendable. The professor handled it, and the cheaters were taken out. The friends are split, but the main point is whether the action was justified.\n\nLegally and academically, institutions usually have policies that encourage students to report misconduct. So, the action aligns with that. The author isn't in a position to judge the cheaters' motives beyond the policy. The consequence is automatic failure, which is a standard penalty. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the person should have tried talking to the cheaters first? But in an exam setting, that's impractical. Also, some might say it's not their place, but in many universities, students are encouraged to maintain academic standards. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author did the right thing by reporting, following the proper procedure through the professor. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
