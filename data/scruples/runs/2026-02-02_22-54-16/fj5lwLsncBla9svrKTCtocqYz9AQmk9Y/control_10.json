Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation did the right thing. Let's start by breaking down the details. The user noticed two people cheating during a final exam. One had notecards under their test, and then they leaned over to see another person's test. The user wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then dealt with the situation and caught the cheaters. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rules and policies of the university. Cheating is a serious academic violation, and most institutions have clear policies against it. If the user's action led to the professor being aware of the cheating, then they might be upholding the academic integrity of the exam. On the other hand, some people might argue that it's not the student's place to act as a snitch, and that it's the professor's responsibility to monitor the exam.\n\nBut in this case, the user didn't directly accuse them in front of everyone. They discreetly informed the professor, which seems like a responsible way to handle it. The professor then confirmed the cheating and took action. The cheaters could face consequences like failing the class, which is what the policy would dictate. \n\nNow, the friends are split. Some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's harsh. But the key here is whether the user acted within the bounds of appropriate behavior. Since the user didn't spread rumors or retaliate, but instead reported the cheating through the proper channel (the professor), it seems justified. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the curve. If the cheaters performed well, it might affect other students' grades. By reporting them, the user might have protected the fairness of the grading system. \n\nHowever, there's also the question of personal ethics. Some might feel it's wrong to expose peers, even if they cheated. But in academic settings, maintaining integrity is usually a priority. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's actions seem to align with the rules and the goal of academic honesty. They reported the cheating in a respectful and discrete manner, leading to the professor taking appropriate action. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
