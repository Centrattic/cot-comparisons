Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the scenario noticed two students cheating during an exam. They took the notecards and saw them leaning over to look at another's test. Then, the author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the note to the professor. The professor then handled the situation, and the cheaters got caught.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the ethical aspect. Cheating is a serious violation in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, they usually face consequences like failing the class. The author observed the cheating and reported it. Is reporting cheating wrong? Generally, no. Most institutions encourage students to report unethical behavior. However, some might argue that the author was being a snitch or that it's not their place to intervene. But others would say that maintaining academic integrity is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThen there's the method. The author wrote a note and discreetly handed it to the professor during the exam. That seems like a responsible way to inform the professor without causing a scene. If they had done it in another way, like confronting the cheaters directly, it might have been more disruptive. By going to the restroom, they could pass the note without interrupting the exam for others.\n\nThe friends are divided. Some say the author was right because the cheaters deserved it. Others say it's wrong because cheating is a personal choice and maybe the author is too harsh. But the professor handles the situation, so the author didn't take it into their own hands. The professor confirmed the cheating and acted, which is the proper procedure.\n\nAnother point: the exam was difficult, and the cheaters could have affected the curve. The author's action might have prevented unfair advantages for the cheaters, which is in the class's best interest. So, from a fairness perspective, the author is doing the right thing.\n\nBut some might argue about privacy or the stress of the situation. However, the professor is responsible for enforcing rules, and the author's report was a necessary part of that process. The author didn't confront the cheaters themselves but informed the authority, which is the correct approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The author's action was to report cheating to the professor in a way that allowed the professor to handle it appropriately. Unless there's a policy against students reporting cheating, which isn't mentioned here, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
