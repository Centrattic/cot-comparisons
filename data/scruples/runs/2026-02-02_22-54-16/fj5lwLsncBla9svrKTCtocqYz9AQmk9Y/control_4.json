Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university final exam. The person noticed someone had notecards and saw them looking at another student's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and informed the professor, who then caught the cheaters. Friends are split on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, academic integrity is a big deal. Cheating undermines the whole system, so reporting it could be seen as the right thing. The professor confirmed they were cheating, so the student likely did the right thing by following the proper procedure. However, some might argue that it's a hard situation, and maybe the cheaters had reasons. But the rules are clear here\u2014cheating leads to failure. The student followed the correct protocol by informing the professor without confronting the cheaters directly. The professor handled it, which is the proper way. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
