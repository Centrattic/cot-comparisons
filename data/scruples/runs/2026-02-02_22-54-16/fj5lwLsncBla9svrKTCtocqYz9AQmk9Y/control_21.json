Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in the exam is wrong. So the situation is that someone saw two students with notecards and passing information during a final. They wrote a note to the professor, got their test taken to the bathroom, and then the professor caught the cheaters. The friends are split on whether it's right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical sides. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity, and reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. It's a final exam where cheating could affect the class curve. If the cheaters are caught and fail, it's fair for others. But on the other hand, some might think it's harsh, especially if the cheaters were under a lot of stress. Also, the method they used\u2014writing a note and sneaking it to the professor\u2014might be seen as underhanded. But the professor did catch them in the act eventually, so maybe the person was just a witness and did the responsible thing. \n\nAnother angle: if the cheaters were planning to cheat and it's against the rules, then reporting them is correct. However, maybe the person could have approached it more directly, like talking to the professor during the exam instead of a note. But the professor did handle it, so maybe the method didn't matter. Also, the person had a right to report the cheating since it's their responsibility to maintain academic honesty. \n\nIn university settings, students are usually encouraged to report academic misconduct. So ethically, the person is in the right. The friends who say it's wrong might be considering the cheaters' situation, but the rules are clear. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
