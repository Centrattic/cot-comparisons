Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, and the report led to the two students being caught and possibly failing. The friends are split, some saying it's right, others wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. Cheating is a serious academic offense. The author noticed the cheating, then discreetly informed the professor, which allowed the professor to take action. The professor then caught the cheaters in the act. \n\nOn one hand, the author did the right thing by maintaining academic integrity. Reporting cheating prevents unfair advantages and maintains fairness for all students. The professor's role is to enforce academic standards, so the author acted responsibly by bringing the issue to their attention. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was a tattletale, or that the cheaters made a mistake and deserved a second chance. However, in most academic settings, cheating is grounds for failure, and the professor has the authority to handle it. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly but used a respectful method to inform the professor, which is appropriate.\n\nThe key points are: the author observed cheating, reported it to the professor without confrontation, and the professor handled the situation. There's no indication that the author acted out of malice or personal gain. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
