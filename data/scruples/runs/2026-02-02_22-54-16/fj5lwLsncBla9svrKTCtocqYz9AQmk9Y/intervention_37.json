Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a university exam where the student noticed two classmates cheating by using notecards and looking at others' tests. The student discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is a serious academic offense, so catching cheaters is usually seen as the right thing to do. The student acted to maintain fairness for their classmates. However, some might argue that the student was overstepping or that the cheaters deserved a chance to explain themselves. But in academic settings, professors have strict policies against cheating, and reporting it is often part of the student's responsibility. The student did it discreetly, which shows they wanted to handle it properly without causing a scene. The professor then took appropriate action. Since the cheaters risked failing the class, the student's action likely prevented unfair advantages. The friends' mixed reactions are understandable, but the ethical stance is that reporting cheating is necessary for academic integrity. So, the answer is B.\n"
