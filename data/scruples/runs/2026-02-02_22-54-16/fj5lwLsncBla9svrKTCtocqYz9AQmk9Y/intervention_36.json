Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that during a final exam, the author noticed two students cheating\u2014using notecards and peeking at another's test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, told the professor, and the professor then caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic violation, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. The professor had the authority to handle it, so the author's action could be justified as maintaining academic integrity.\n\nBut there's also the method. The author didn't directly confront the cheaters but instead informed the professor discreetly. Some might argue that this is the correct approach because it allows the professor to handle it without escalating or causing a scene during the exam. Others might say it's interfering or being a \"tattletale,\" especially if there's a belief that students shouldn't report peers in such a way.\n\nThe friends' opinions are divided. Some support the action, others don't. The key here is the impact. The professor acted, and the cheaters face consequences, which is fair. However, the author might have felt pressure or had personal reasons for reporting. But since the professor handled it, maybe the author's role was appropriate.\n\nPotential issues: Did the author have a personal vendetta? The scenario doesn't suggest that. The cheaters could have affected the curve, which might have impacted other students' grades. So, the author's action could be seen as protecting academic fairness.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that it's not the student's responsibility to police others during exams. The professor is there to enforce rules. However, in this case, the author noticed the cheating and took initiative, which could be seen as a responsible action.\n\nI think the main points are about the severity of the cheating and the method of reporting. Since the author used a discreet and respectful method, pointing out the issue to the professor without causing a disruption, it's likely justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
