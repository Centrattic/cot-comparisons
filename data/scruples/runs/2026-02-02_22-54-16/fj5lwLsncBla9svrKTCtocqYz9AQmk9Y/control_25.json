Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author noticed two students cheating during a final exam. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and informed the professor. The professor then caught them and they didn't return. The friends are split on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. Academic integrity is usually a big deal in universities. Cheating is considered a serious offense, and reporting it is often encouraged. The professor did take action, leading to the cheaters being caught. The author's method was a bit sneaky, but they did inform the professor without directly confronting the cheaters during the exam, which might have been disruptive.\n\nNow, the possible arguments. Some might say the author did the right thing by upholding academic standards. Others might argue that it's harsh, especially if the exam was hard, and maybe the cheaters felt pressured. But the policy here is clear: cheating leads to automatic failure. The author followed the proper procedure by informing the professor, so they're not acting outside the system.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be any fault? Maybe if the note was a misunderstanding, but the professor confirmed she caught them. The author didn't spread rumors or take matters into their own hands. The method was discreet, which is probably the right approach to avoid embarrassment or escalation during the exam.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is acting within the rules and promoting fairness. The friends' mixed reactions are normal, but the action itself seems justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
