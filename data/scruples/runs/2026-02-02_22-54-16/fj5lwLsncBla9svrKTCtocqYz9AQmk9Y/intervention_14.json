Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a university student noticing two classmates cheating during a final exam and reporting them to the professor. The friends have mixed opinions, and the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. The professor handled it by catching them, leading to possible failure. Some might argue that the student did the right thing by maintaining fairness, especially if the class curve is affected. Others might think it's interfering with others' privacy or that the student shouldn't get involved.\n\nBut then, there's the context of being in a university setting. Universities have policies against cheating, and students are often encouraged to report such incidents. The method the student used\u2014writing a note and discreetly informing the professor\u2014seems responsible. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene or conflict. The professor's response was to monitor and catch them, which is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student shouldn't have taken it upon themselves, but in a situation where cheating is affecting the class curve, it's a valid concern. Also, the professor's authority comes into play here. If the professor is aware and takes action, the student's role is justified.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The cheaters might fail, which is a harsh outcome, but it's a result of the university's academic policies. The student's action prevented unfair advantage, which is in line with ethical standards. The friends' divided opinions show that there's no clear consensus, but the main point is that the student acted to prevent cheating, which is generally encouraged in academic settings.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the student's action aligns with maintaining academic integrity and following proper procedures. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
