Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed two students cheating by using notecards and looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do. However, some might argue that it's a personal choice and that the reporter is being a \"snitch,\" which can create tension among peers. The person did it discreetly, which might minimize some of the backlash. \n\nThe professor handled the situation, and the cheaters didn't return, implying they were dealt with according to university policies. The author's friends have mixed opinions. Some think the author did the right thing because cheating is wrong, especially in a final that affects the class curve. Others might think it's harsh because school is hard, and cheating is a personal choice.\n\nI should also consider the university's stance on cheating. If the rules clearly state that cheating leads to automatic failure, then the author's action was in line with enforcing those rules. The method of reporting was clever and respectful, as they didn't confront the cheaters directly but informed the professor properly. \n\nOn the other hand, some might feel it's unkind to ruin someone's chance at the class, but academic integrity is a priority in educational institutions. The author didn't act out of spite but to uphold fairness. \n\nIn most cases, reporting cheating is the responsible action. The author didn't fabricate anything and provided evidence. So, the answer is likely that they're not in the wrong.\n"
