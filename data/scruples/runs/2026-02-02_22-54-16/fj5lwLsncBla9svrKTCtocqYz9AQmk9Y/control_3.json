Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two classmates for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is from a university final exam where the person noticed notecards and saw someone leaning to look at another's test. They wrote a note, used the bathroom to give it to the professor, and the professor caught them in the act.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it undermines academic integrity. By reporting the cheating, the person is upholding the rules set by the institution. However, some might argue that it's a harsh decision to let others fail a class because of cheating, especially if the exams are tough. But the policy says automatic failure, so the professor has to enforce it.\n\nThe method the student used was clever but discreet. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene, and instead let the professor handle it. Friends are divided: some think it's right to report cheating, others say it's unkind. But the key point is whether the person did violate any rules. They didn't interfere directly, just informed the professor. The professor then acted. \n\nCheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is usually expected in academic settings. The person didn't act out of malice but to maintain fairness. Even though some might feel it's harsh, the system is designed to penalize cheating. So, the person isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
