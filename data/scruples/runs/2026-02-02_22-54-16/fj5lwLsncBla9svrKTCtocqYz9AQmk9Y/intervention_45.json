Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario involves noticing someone with notecards and then passing them to another student during the exam. The person then informs the professor discreetly, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic violation, and universities typically have strict policies against it. By reporting the cheating, the person is upholding academic integrity. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome for the cheaters, but the rules are usually in place to maintain fairness for all students.\n\nThe method of reporting seems appropriate. The person wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse, and delivered the information without causing a scene. This approach is respectful and avoids public confrontation, which could be seen as more considerate.\n\nLooking at the consequences, the cheaters were caught and their actions were addressed. The professor handled it by taking their tests and removing them, which is standard procedure. The fact that the class curve might be affected is another reason to report, as it ensures fair grading for everyone.\n\nSome friends are conflicted, but the majority opinion isn't a factor here. The individual's decision to report is a personal choice, and as long as it's done ethically and within the rules, it's justified. The key points are the violation of academic policies, the method of reporting, and the outcome. The person acting in this situation followed the right steps to address the cheating without overstepping their role. Therefore, the answer should be B, as the author is not in the wrong.\n"
