Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author noticed notecards and someone leaning over to see another's test. They wrote a note and went to the bathroom to inform the professor. The professor then watched them and caught them. The friends are divided; some say it's right because cheating is bad, others say it's wrong because school is hard. Cheating here leads to automatic failure.\n\nSo, the main points: the author reported cheating, which led to the professor taking action. The question is about morality and whether the author did something wrong. \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic violation. If the author didn't report it, others might not have known, and the cheaters could have gained an unfair advantage, affecting the class curve. By reporting, the author is upholding academic integrity, which is generally seen as the right thing. However, some might argue that the author acted out of self-interest, maybe to help their own grade by pushing the curve. But the author mentions they had to go to the bathroom, so the intent might have been genuine to report.\n\nAlso, the professor's response was to watch them and then act, which shows that the author's report was taken seriously. The cheaters didn't return, so they were likely failed. The friends' conflicting opinions might be because some see it as necessary to stop cheating, while others feel it's harsh. \n\nIn university settings, academic dishonesty is typically dealt with by the administration, and students are often encouraged to report violations. The author's method was discreet, which might be necessary to avoid confrontation. So, from an academic policy standpoint, the author is probably not in the wrong. Morally, it's about whether maintaining fairness is worth the potential consequences for the cheaters. \n\nPossible wrongs: Maybe the author didn't handle it directly, like talking to the cheaters first or using an official reporting method. But in the situation, the professor was the right authority to inform. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), as the author acted to prevent cheating and followed proper channels.\n"
