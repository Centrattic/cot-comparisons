Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The guy had notecards under his test and then leaned over to look at another friend's paper. The author wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act and took their tests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Cheating is usually a serious offense, often leading to automatic failure. The professor here did take action, so the author's actions led to the appropriate consequences. \n\nThe author's friends are split. Some say they did the right thing because the cheaters were being stupid. Others think it's wrong because school is hard and maybe the cheaters needed the help. But the key point is whether the author acted correctly by reporting them. \n\nIn academic settings, integrity is crucial. If students don't report cheating, it undermines the fairness of the system. The author didn't confront them directly, which could have been disruptive, but instead used a discreet method to inform the professor. That seems responsible because the professor is the one who should handle the situation. \n\nSome might argue that the author was tattling, but in a professional context like a university exam, it's the correct procedure to report violations. The author had the right intention\u2014ensuring that cheating doesn't affect the class curve. Also, the professor confirmed she would handle it, so the author followed the proper channels. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the students were under stress, but the rules are there for a reason. Cheating is a choice, and the consequences are part of the academic policy. The author didn't act out of malice but to uphold academic integrity. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the right steps and respected the authority. Answer B.\n"
