Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported two students for cheating during an exam is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, which adds context because academic integrity policies are usually strict there.\n\nFirst, the student noticed notecards and someone peeking at another's test. Cheating in exams is a serious offense, and universities typically have measures to enforce academic honesty. The student decided to inform the professor discreetly by writing a note and using the restroom as an excuse. This method was clever to avoid confrontation but still get the information to the professor. \n\nThe professor then watched the students and caught them in the act. The students didn't return, likely facing the consequences, which in this case is an automatic failure. Now, the student is getting mixed feedback from friends. Some think they did the right thing by upholding integrity, while others feel it's harsh because school is hard.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, cheating undermines the system, and reporting it maintains fairness for others. The professor's role includes enforcing rules, and the student's action helped her do that. On the other hand, some might argue it's a personal choice to cheat, and the student might have overstepped. But in academic settings, policies usually encourage reporting misconduct. The student didn't confront the cheaters directly, which avoids personal conflict. \n\nAlso, the author's method was respectful and non-confrontational. They didn't spread rumors or accuse publicly, which is important. The professor handled the situation appropriately by intervening. Since the university's rules would likely support reporting cheating, the student acted in accordance with institutional policies. The friends' mixed reactions are normal, but the ethical stance here is on the side of the student who upheld academic integrity without personal malice.\n"
