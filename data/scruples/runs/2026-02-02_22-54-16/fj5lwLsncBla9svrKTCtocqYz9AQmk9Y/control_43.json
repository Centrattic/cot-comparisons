Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where two students were caught cheating after someone reported them. The person who reported them did so discreetly by writing a note and handing it to the professor during a bathroom break.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. The professor has a responsibility to enforce academic integrity, and students are generally expected to report violations. By reporting the cheating, the person is upholding these standards, which is a positive action from an institutional standpoint.\n\nHowever, there's the social aspect to consider. Some might argue that cheating is a personal decision and that the cheaters' failure is their own doing. Others might feel that the reporter is being a \"rat\" and that the cheaters faced consequences that are too harsh, especially if the exam was difficult. But the professor's policy was clear\u2014cheating leads to automatic failure. The reporter didn't decide their fate; the professor did.\n\nLegally and institutionally, the reporter acted correctly. They provided evidence (the note) and allowed the professor to handle the situation. There's no indication of malicious intent or false reporting. The cheaters were given a chance to explain or face the consequences through proper channels.\n\nOn the flip side, if the reporter had done something like spreading rumors without evidence, that would be problematic. But here, the action was direct and through the appropriate authority. The professor confirmed the cheating, so the reporter's intervention was valid.\n\nSome friends think it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's wrong because the exam was hard. But the core issue is about academic integrity. The reporter didn't make the cheaters fail; the professor did based on the rules. The reporter just ensured that the rules were enforced.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They upheld academic standards and followed proper procedures.\n"
