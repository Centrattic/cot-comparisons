Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two students for cheating on a final exam. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person noticed cheating: notecards under the test and peeking. They wrote a note and discreetly informed the professor. The professor then handled the situation, caught the cheaters, and they didn't return. \n\nCheating is a serious academic integrity issue. Reporting it is generally expected in academic settings. The professor probably appreciates the student's action because it maintains fairness. The class curve could be affected, so other students might be thankful. However, some might argue that the student should have let the professor handle it without intervention, but in this case, the student had to inform the professor to allow her to act.\n\nThe friends have mixed opinions. Some support it as doing the right thing, others think it's harsh. But academically, cheating is against the rules, and reporting it is usually encouraged. The person didn't confront them directly, just informed the professor. So the action seems justified. \n\nI need to decide if the action was wrong. Since the student followed the proper channel (professor), and the cheaters faced consequences, the student isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
