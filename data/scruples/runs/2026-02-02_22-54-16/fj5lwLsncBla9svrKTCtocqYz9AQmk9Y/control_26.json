Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university setting. So the person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's tests during a final exam. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, informed the professor, and the professor then caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. Cheating is a serious academic offense, so preventing it could be seen as the right thing to do. However, the person did report anonymously or in a way that might not have been directly confrontational. They used a note and went to the bathroom, which could be seen as a clever way to avoid direct confrontation.\n\nNow, the friends have divided opinions. Some think the person did the right thing because cheating is wrong, others say it's wrong because school is hard. But the professor handles the consequences, like automatic failure. The key points here are the academic integrity and the method of reporting.\n\nThe main question is whether the reporter acted wrongly. In many academic settings, students are encouraged to report cheating to maintain fairness. However, the method of reporting might matter. Using a note and going through the professor is a proper channel. The reporter didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could be seen as responsible.\n\nBut maybe there's an argument that the reporter was overstepping, but in most cases, reporting cheating is considered a duty. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted to uphold academic integrity through the correct procedures.\n"
