Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting two classmates for cheating. So, the situation is during a final exam in university. The person noticed their neighbor had notecards and then leaned over to look at another student's test. They wrote a note to the professor and went to the bathroom to tell them. The professor then caught the cheaters in the act, and they didn't return. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense. If the person didn't cheat themselves and reported it, they might be doing the right thing by upholding academic integrity. But others might say it's interfering or being a snitch, especially if the cheaters had a hard time or if the person is being too harsh.\n\nThe professor's role is to enforce rules. By reporting, the student allowed the professor to handle it, which is the proper procedure. The student didn't confront them directly, which might be seen as a good approach. However, some might argue that it's better to talk to the cheaters first or not get involved, but in a test scenario, immediate reporting is often encouraged.\n\nAlso, the class size is small, 30 students, so the impact on the curve is a factor. If someone cheats, it could unfairly affect others. The person who reported might be protecting the fairness for the rest of the class.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The student didn't approach the cheaters directly but went through the professor, which is the correct channel. So they didn't escalate it beyond the professor's handling. That seems responsible.\n\nThe friends' divided opinions might reflect different values. Some prioritize academic honesty, others might think stress makes cheating understandable. But academically, cheating is a violation, so the student's action is in line with university policies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They acted ethically by reporting through proper channels, ensuring the professor could address the cheating. Therefore, answer B.\n"
