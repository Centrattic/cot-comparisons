Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for reporting two people who were cheating on a final exam. The answer should be either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. It's a university setting, and the person noticed two students cheating. They used a note to inform the professor, pretending to go to the bathroom. The professor then caught the students and they didn't return, likely failing the class.\n\nThe user mentions that friends are split. Some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's wrong because school is hard. But the key point here is whether the author did something unethical or inappropriate. \n\nI should start by looking at the rules of the university. Generally, academic integrity policies require students to report cheating. If reporting is a responsibility, then the author might be right. Also, the professor handled the situation, which is their role. The method used was a note and a bathroom break, which is clever but not necessarily wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author acted as a judge, possibly ruining the cheaters' lives. But in academic settings, cheating is a serious offense, and the professor is supposed to enforce the rules. The author's action was to bring the issue to the professor's attention, which is part of maintaining fairness. \n\nAlso, the professor already had the situation under control after the report, so the author didn't take matters into their own hands beyond informing the authority. The note was a discreet way to report without causing a scene. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had interfered directly, like taking the notecards or confronting the students, that could be different. But here, they just reported the incident to the professor, which is the correct procedure. \n\nCheating undermines the academic system, and by reporting, the author is upholding the standards. While it's true that school is challenging, the policy is in place for a reason, and the professor's job is to enforce it. \n\nSo, the author's action seems justified. The friends who argue it's wrong because of school difficulty might not understand the importance of academic honesty. The main issue is whether the author followed the correct protocol, which they did by informing the professor. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
