Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two students who were cheating on a final exam. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person noticed notecards and saw one student looking at another's test. They reported this to the professor discreetly. The professor then caught them in the act and took action. The class is small, so cheating could affect the curve. The person's friends have mixed opinions. Some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's harsh given school is hard.\n\nNow, the key points. Cheating is against academic integrity policies. Reporting it is typically expected to maintain fairness. The person acted in what they believed was the right way to uphold the rules. However, some might argue it's interfering or unnecessary. But in most academic settings, students are encouraged to report cheating. The professor handled it, so the person did their duty without confronting the cheaters directly, which could be risky. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The person didn't confront the cheaters, just informed the professor. There's no indication they had a vendetta or did it out of spite. So, the action aligns with upholding academic standards. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
