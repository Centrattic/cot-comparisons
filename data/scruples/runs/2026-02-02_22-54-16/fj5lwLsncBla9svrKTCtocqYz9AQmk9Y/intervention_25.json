Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, so academic integrity policies are probably in place here.\n\nFirst, the person noticed two students cheating. One had notecards under their test, and they were communicating during the exam. The professor confirmed the author's report, leading to the cheaters' tests being confiscated. The main question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting them.\n\nSome people might argue that the author did the right thing because cheating undermines the fairness of the exam and the academic standards. The professor handles it, so the author is just upholding the rules. Others might say that the author was harsh, considering the stress of finals, but the policy is clear: cheating leads to failure. \n\nThe author's method was subtle\u2014they wrote a note and used the restroom as an excuse. They didn't cause a disruption, which is a good point. Also, the professor was already aware and handled it, so the author's action was necessary to maintain the integrity of the exam. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have trusted the professor to monitor the exam without interference. But in this case, the professor did see it and acted. The main argument against the author would be that they took it upon themselves, but since the professor confirmed the cheaters were caught, it seems justified. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author likely did the right thing by reporting in a discreet and responsible manner. The cheaters violated the rules, and the author helped uphold academic integrity without causing a scene. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
