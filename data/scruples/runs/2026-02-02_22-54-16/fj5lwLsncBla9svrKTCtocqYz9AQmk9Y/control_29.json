Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in the exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the author noticed two students using notecards and looking at another's test. They wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, who then caught the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it might be seen as upholding standards. On the other hand, some might argue that the author was interfering or that the cheaters made a mistake.\n\nThe professor confirmed the cheating and acted, so the author's action led to the right outcome. Friends are divided\u2014some say it's right because cheating is bad, others think it's harsh given school is hard. The key points are: the author acted to maintain fairness, followed proper channels, and didn't confront the cheaters directly. \n\nAcademic policies usually encourage reporting cheating. The author didn't make the decision to fail them; the professor did. So the author's role was to report, which is typically expected. However, some might feel it's a personal matter, but in an academic setting, integrity is paramount. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the author reported the cheating appropriately, which is the correct action to maintain fairness in the class.\n"
