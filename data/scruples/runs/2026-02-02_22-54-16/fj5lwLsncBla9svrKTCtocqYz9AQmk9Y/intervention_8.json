Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported two cheaters in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is at a university, so academic integrity policies are probably in place.\n\nFirst, the person noticed notecards and saw the students looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse, and told the professor. The professor then intervened and caught them in the act. The cheaters didn't return, so they probably failed.\n\nAcademically speaking, cheating is against the rules, and reporting it is usually encouraged. The person acted to uphold academic standards. Friends are split\u2014some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others think it's harsh given school is tough. But the main point is whether the reporter acted wrongfully.\n\nPossible arguments for being wrong: Maybe they acted out of spite, or it's a personal vendetta. But the scenario doesn't mention any personal issues. The person just noticed and reported. Also, the method was discreet, using a note and bathroom break, which shows they wanted to handle it properly without confrontation.\n\nAnother angle: Did they have sufficient evidence? They saw notecards and observed the act, which is credible. The professor confirmed it, so it's valid. The consequence was automatic failure, which is standard for cheating. The person didn't give false info; they provided accurate observation.\n\nSo, considering academic integrity and the proper procedure of reporting, the person did the right thing. The answer is B.\n"
