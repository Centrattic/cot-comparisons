Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the person who reported two students for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is in a university setting during a final exam. The person noticed someone had notecards and then they looked at another student's test. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, told the professor, and the professor then caught them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university regarding cheating. Usually, academic integrity policies are strict. If the professor has a policy that cheating leads to automatic failure, then the students who cheated would face consequences. The person reporting them might be doing the right thing by upholding the integrity of the exam.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person is being a tattletale, especially if the students didn't get caught otherwise. But in this case, the professor did catch them after the report. So the report directly led to the professor taking action. \n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The person used a note and went to the bathroom to discreetly inform the professor. They didn't cause a disruption during the exam. That seems like a responsible way to handle it without creating a scene. \n\nSome friends think it's right because the cheaters deserved it for trying to cheat in a final, which is a major exam. Others think it's wrong because school is hard and maybe the cheaters were just under pressure. But the professor's policy is clear: automatic failure. So the cheaters knew the risk when they decided to cheat.\n\nThe author might have felt conflicted, but their action prevented unfair advantage that could affect the class curve. The professor handled it, so the author didn't take matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
