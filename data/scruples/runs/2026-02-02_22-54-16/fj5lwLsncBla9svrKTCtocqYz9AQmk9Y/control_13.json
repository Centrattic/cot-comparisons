Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in their exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the person noticed two students with notecards and saw them looking at another's test. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them. The friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating in exams is usually considered dishonest, and reporting it can prevent unfair advantages. The professor confirmed the action by catching them, so the report was valid. However, some might argue that the person could have confronted the cheaters directly or given them a chance to stop.\n\nBut in academic settings, there's often a responsibility to uphold integrity. Universities have policies against cheating, and students are sometimes encouraged to report violations. The person here did it discreetly to avoid confrontation, which might be seen as a good approach. They didn't want to make a scene, which could be respectful to others.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the individual shouldn't interfere in others' affairs. However, cheating affects everyone's grades and the fairness of the process. By reporting, they helped maintain the class's curve and the validity of the exam results. The professor handled it, so the students faced the consequences, which is part of the academic system.\n\nAlso, considering the automatic failure for cheating, the person's action led to a just outcome. Friends' differing opinions might reflect personal values, but the institution's rules are clear. The individual followed the correct procedure by informing the professor, which is the appropriate way to handle such situations.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the person is not in the wrong. They acted according to academic integrity policies and helped ensure fairness.\n"
