Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting two students cheating during a final exam. I need to determine if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the situation: The author noticed two people cheating during a final. One had notecards under their test, and then they leaned over to look at another's exam. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act, confiscated their tests, and they didn't return. The friends are divided on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nCheating is a serious issue in academic settings. The university likely has policies against academic dishonesty, and the professor's role is to enforce those. By reporting the cheating, the author is upholding academic integrity. However, some might argue that confronting it directly would be better, but the professor's presence and intervention show that the author's action led to a proper resolution.\n\nThe key points here are that the author didn't act impulsively but rather discreetly informed the professor, allowing her to handle the situation. The professor took appropriate action, which resulted in the cheaters being caught. The author's action prevented unfair advantage, which affects the class curve and the integrity of the exam. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author could have directly confronted the cheaters first, but in an exam setting, students aren't supposed to intervene. The professor's role is to manage such situations. The author acted within the system by reporting to the professor, which is the correct procedure. \n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the cheaters' consequences are part of the academic policy. The author's action, while maybe uncomfortable, is ethically sound in maintaining fairness. Friends' opinions vary, but the main ethical consideration is the duty to uphold academic standards. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
