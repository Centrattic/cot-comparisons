Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe person took a final exam and noticed a guy next to them had notecards under their test. Then the guy poked his friend in front and leaned over to look at their exam. The person wrote a note about this, went to the bathroom, gave the note to the professor, and the professor handled it. The professor then caught the cheaters and they didn't return. Some friends think the person did the right thing, others say it's wrong because school is hard. Cheating leads to automatic failure here.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? The user thinks the author is not wrong. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the act of cheating is against academic integrity. Universities have policies against it. If you catch someone cheating, it's usually expected to report it. The person here didn't confront them directly but informed the professor. The method they used was subtle\u2014writing a note and giving it during a bathroom break. That might have been to avoid confrontation or to make sure the professors could handle it without the cheaters knowing.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not the student's responsibility to police others. However, in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report violations of conduct. The alternative is that the cheaters would get away with it, which could affect the fairness of grading for others. The user mentions the class curve, so the cheaters could have negatively impacted others' grades.\n\nThe person's action led to the cheaters being caught, which is probably the correct outcome. Friends are split, but the ethical stance is that maintaining academic integrity is important. The method used was respectful and didn't cause a scene during the exam, which is commendable. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
