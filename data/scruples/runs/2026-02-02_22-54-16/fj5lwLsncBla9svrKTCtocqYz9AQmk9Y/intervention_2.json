Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed two students cheating by using notecards and looking at another's test. They wrote a note and discreetly told the professor, who then confronted them. The classmate's friends are divided on whether the action was right or wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. \n\nEthically, cheating is a violation of academic integrity. Reporting it can be seen as upholding standards. However, some might argue it's a personal choice to report or not. The person here did it discreetly, which shows they wanted to avoid confrontation but still act on their observation. \n\nThe professor handled it, so the author didn't directly confront the cheaters. The outcome was that the cheaters failed, which could be seen as fair since cheating leads to failure. \n\nBut maybe there's a gray area. Could the author have done something else, like not reporting? But if they believed it was wrong, reporting might be their duty. The university's policies likely support reporting. \n\nSo, considering academic integrity and the potential consequences of cheating, the author's action seems justified. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
