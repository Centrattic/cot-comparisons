Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that during a final exam, the student notices two people cheating\u2014using notecards and looking at another's test. The student then writes a note, goes to the restroom to give the note to the professor, and the professor eventually catches them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. The professor is supposed to handle such situations, and the student's action might be protecting the fairness for other students. The class curve being affected is another point\u2014cheating could disadvantage others, so reporting might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student overstepped by taking it upon themselves to report. Maybe the professor should have been the one to handle it without student intervention. Also, there's the stress and pressure of exams, and some might say the cheaters were just trying to cope with the difficulty. However, the rules are clear\u2014cheating leads to automatic failure, so the cheaters made their choice.\n\nAnother angle: the method of reporting. The student did it discreetly, which shows thoughtfulness to avoid confrontation. They didn't make a scene, just informed the professor. The professor then took action, which means the student followed proper procedure.\n\nSo, the key points are academic honesty, fairness to peers, and following the correct reporting procedures. The student acted in a way that upheld the institution's rules without causing unnecessary drama. Friends' conflicting opinions highlight differing views on responsibility, but the action itself seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
