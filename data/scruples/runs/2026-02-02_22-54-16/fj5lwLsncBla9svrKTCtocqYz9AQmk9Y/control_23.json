Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by reporting two students for cheating during a final exam. The professor caught them because the student pointed it out. Now, friends are divided on the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Cheating is usually a serious offense, so the professor probably has a duty to enforce the rules. The student noticed the cheating, documented it, and reported it discreetly. That seems responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student was being a \"rat\" or interfering in a personal matter. But cheating undermines academic integrity, which is supposed to be upheld by everyone. The professor confirmed the action by taking over and handling it. The students who cheated failed, which is the consequence of their actions. \n\nThe student's friends are split, but the key point is whether the student acted in the wrong. Since the professor agreed and addressed the issue, the student followed the proper procedure. Reporting cheating is generally seen as the right thing to do in an academic setting. So the answer is probably B, the student isn't in the wrong.\n"
