Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting two students for cheating. The scenario is in a university setting, which is important because academic policies can vary, but generally, cheating is a serious offense.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person noticed notecards and saw the student looking at another's test. They took a note, left their test with the professor, pointed out the issue, and the professor handled it. The students were caught and didn't return. Friends are divided on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nNow, to evaluate. Academic integrity is a core value in universities. Cheating undermines the fairness of assessments and the value of the degree for everyone. Reporting cheating when you witness it is often considered a responsibility. The method the author used seems discreet\u2014writing a note and using the restroom to hand it over. This avoids public confrontation, which is probably a good approach to prevent escalation.\n\nHowever, there's a debate here. Some might argue that the author could have addressed it differently, like confronting the cheaters first, but in an exam setting, it's often better to inform the professor discreetly. The professor is responsible for enforcing academic policies, so the author was following the appropriate channel. \n\nOn the other hand, others might say that the students were under stress and school is hard, so maybe the author should have been more lenient. But the rules are in place for a reason, and cheating is typically an automatic failure. The author didn't take it upon themselves to punish but instead informed the professor, who then acted. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they reported the cheating in a responsible and discreet manner, allowing the professor to handle it according to the university's policies. There's no indication of malice; the motivation seems to be upholding academic integrity for the class. The friends' mixed reactions are common, but the action itself aligns with expected conduct when witnessing academic misconduct.\n"
