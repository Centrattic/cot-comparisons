Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for reporting two people cheating on a final exam.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person noticed someone with notecards under their test and then saw them looking at a friend's test. They wrote a note, went to the bathroom, and handed the note to the professor. The professor then caught them in the act and took their tests. The author is getting divided opinions from friends\u2014some say they did the right thing, others say it's wrong because school is hard and cheating might have been a result of that.\n\nNow, the key points here are academic integrity policies. In most universities, cheating is strictly prohibited. Reporting it is usually considered a duty to uphold fairness. However, the method of reporting might matter. The author used a note and went through the professor, which seems appropriate. They didn't confront the cheaters directly, which might avoid conflict. The professor handled it, so the consequences were dealt with by the authority.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was a tattletale, maybe overstepping, especially if the cheaters were under stress. However, the policy is there for a reason. If the author didn't report, it could undermine the system. Also, the cheaters knew the rules and chose to break them, so the author's action was enforcing the rules.\n\nAnother angle: the class curve might be affected, so reporting ensures fairness for others. The author's action prevented unfair advantage. The professor's response was to intervene, which is standard. So the author followed proper procedures.\n\nBut some might say that the author should have addressed it differently, like talking to the cheaters first. However, in an exam setting, it's usually advised to report to the proctor immediately. The author did that, so it's within the right steps.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They upheld academic integrity by following the correct protocol. The friends' mixed opinions are because of different perspectives, but the action itself aligns with proper conduct.\n"
