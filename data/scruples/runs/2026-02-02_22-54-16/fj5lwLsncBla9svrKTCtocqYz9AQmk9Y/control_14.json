Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in the exam was in the wrong. The situation involves a university student who noticed two classmates cheating during a final exam. The student wrote a note to the professor, using a bathroom break as a cover, and the professor ended up catching the cheaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is a serious academic violation. By informing the professor, the student is upholding academic integrity. However, some might argue that the student could have addressed it in a different way, like telling the professor directly after the exam. But in this case, the student did it discreetly during the exam, which could prevent the cheaters from continuing and allow the professor to handle it immediately.\n\nNext, the professor's role is to maintain fairness. If the cheaters had succeeded, it could have negatively affected the curve for the entire class, as mentioned. The student's action might have prevented unfair advantages. The friends' mixed reactions are understandable\u2014some see it as doing the right thing, others as harsh. But in academic settings, honesty is generally expected, and reporting cheating is a responsibility to maintain fairness.\n\nAnother angle: Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the student acted under the circumstances. The professor appreciated the note and handled it. The cheaters faced consequences, which is standard. The student didn't act out of malice but to ensure fairness. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
