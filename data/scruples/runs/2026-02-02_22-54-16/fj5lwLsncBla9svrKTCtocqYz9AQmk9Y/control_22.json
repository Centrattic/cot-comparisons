Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is they saw two people cheating on a final exam in university. The person noticed the cheating, wrote a note, asked to go to the bathroom, gave the note to the professor, and the professor then caught the cheaters. Now friends are split on whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. Academic integrity policies usually state that cheating is a serious offense, and students are supposed to report it. So from a policy standpoint, the person did the right thing by informing the professor. They didn't confront the cheaters themselves, which could have been risky or caused a scene. Instead, they discreetly informed the professor, which is a standard procedure in such cases.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person is being a snitch, which can create a hostile environment. But in an academic setting, cheating can unfairly affect other students' grades and the integrity of the institution. The professor would handle the situation, so the student isn't taking matters into their own hands beyond what's expected.\n\nAnother angle is the motive. The person mentioned the exam was brutal and they wanted to prevent messing up the curve. This shows they had a self-interest in reporting, but also a concern for fairness. Even if there's a personal motive, the act of reporting is still appropriate within the system's guidelines.\n\nThe method they used seems respectful\u2014they wrote a note, took the bathroom break to hand it over, and didn't disrupt the exam. The professor then took action, which is the proper way. There's no indication of fabrication or malicious intent here.\n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the consequences are already set by the professor. The student didn't fail them; the system did. The student just reported the facts as they saw them.\n\nFriends' opinions vary, but the main point is whether the action was in line with the rules. Since universities encourage reporting misconduct, the student isn't in the wrong. They upheld the academic standards.\n"
