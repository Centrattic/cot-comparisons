Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a student who noticed two classmates cheating during a final exam and reported them to the professor. The question is whether the student did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and universities usually have strict policies against it. The professor in this case is in a position to handle cheating incidents, so the student's action of reporting the cheating might be seen as upholding academic integrity. However, there are also social dynamics at play here. The person reporting might be seen as a \"snitch\" or \"rat,\" which can be socially awkward. \n\nThe student wrote a note, used the restroom as an excuse to talk to the professor, and provided specific details. That seems responsible because they didn't just accuse without evidence. The professor then confirmed the cheating and took action. The student's friends are divided, some saying it's right because cheating is bad, others saying it's wrong because school is hard. \n\nI should also think about the consequences. Cheating can indeed affect the grades of honest students, especially in a curved class. The professor's action in this case would be to handle the cheaters, which the student facilitated. \n\nBut is there a downside to the student's actions? Maybe if the cheaters were falsely accused, but the student observed the notecards and the act of looking at another's test. That seems like sufficient evidence. Also, the professor was involved, so the student followed proper channels. \n\nIn most university policies, students are encouraged to report cheating to the appropriate authority. So, the student might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's the professor's responsibility to monitor the exam, and the student overstepped. But the professor might not have noticed otherwise, so the student's intervention was helpful.\n\nAnother angle is the social aspect. In a close-knit class of 30, the cheaters might have been friends, and the student's action could strain relationships. But academically, cheating is a serious issue. \n\nOverall, the student acted in a way that maintains academic integrity, followed the right procedures by informing the professor, and contributed to preventing unfair advantages. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
