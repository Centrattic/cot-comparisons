Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario is from a university setting, so academic integrity policies are probably involved.\n\nFirst, the person noticed notecards under someone's test and then saw communication between two students. They wrote a note, used the bathroom as an excuse to give it to the professor, and the professor acted on it. The friends are split on whether it's right or wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, cheating undermines the academic system and fairness. Reporting it upholds integrity, which is a positive action. The person didn't confront them directly but discreetly informed the professor, which is probably the correct procedure. The professor handled it, leading to the cheaters being caught.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that being a \"rat\" is negative, especially in a peer group. However, the university has clear policies against cheating, and the professor's role is to enforce those. The person followed the proper channel by informing the professor rather than taking matters into their own hands. The friends' mixed reactions show the social tension, but academically, it's a clear violation.\n\nAutomatic failure is a consequence, but the person reporting isn't the one administering the penalty. Their action was to maintain fairness, which is in line with institutional rules. Personal feelings about the difficulty of school don't justify cheating, and the person acted responsibly. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
