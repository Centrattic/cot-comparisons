Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the person noticed a classmate using notecards and communicating with another student. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and informed the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters and they didn't return. The user's friends are split, but they think the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating undermines academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as upholding standards. However, some might argue that it's a betrayal of trust or that the person should have handled it differently. The key points here are that the person acted in a way that didn't directly confront the cheaters during the exam, which might be seen as a respectful approach. The professor handled the situation, leading to the cheaters' failure, which is a consequence they chose to face.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the class curve. If the cheaters had performed well, it could unfairly affect other students' grades. By reporting, the author might have protected their peers from an unfair curve. However, some might question if the effort to cheat was worth the risk, but the rules are in place for a reason.\n\nThe method of reporting is important. The author didn't make a scene, which could be seen as minimizing disruption. They trusted the professor to handle it, showing responsibility without overstepping. There's also the aspect of personal integrity; by not cheating themselves, the author is upholding their own standards.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the person should have confronted the cheaters first or given them a chance to stop. But in an exam setting, direct confrontation isn't practical and could lead to immediate consequences for the reporter. The professor's role is to enforce the rules, so informing them is the proper course of action.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions align with maintaining academic integrity, following procedures, and not engaging in the cheating themselves. The friends' mixed reactions are normal, but the decision to report through the appropriate authority seems justifiable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
