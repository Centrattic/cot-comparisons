Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who reported the cheating students is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a university final exam, the author noticed two classmates using notecards and looking at each other's tests. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters, who were taken out and didn't return. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but they're asking for opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. The university's honor code likely prohibits such actions, and reporting it is a way to maintain fairness. The author acted to prevent unfair advantage, which could affect the class curve. However, some might argue that the author was overstepping or that the cheaters deserved a chance to explain themselves. \n\nBut the professor did handle it, so the author's role was to inform. The method was discreet, which avoids public shaming. The cheaters faced consequences, which is part of academic integrity policies. Friends are divided, but the main point is about the rightness of the action. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the author justified in intervening? Did they act appropriately? In many academic institutions, students are encouraged to report misconduct. The author's action led to the professor taking action, which is the right process. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
