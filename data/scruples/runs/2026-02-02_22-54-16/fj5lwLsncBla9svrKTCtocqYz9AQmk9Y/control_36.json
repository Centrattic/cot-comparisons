Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported cheating in an exam was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person noticed two students cheating during a final exam. They wrote a note, left their test with the professor, and went to the restroom to discreetly inform the professor. The professor then took action and caught the cheaters.\n\nCheating is against academic integrity policies, so reporting it is generally expected. The person here didn't confront them directly but used a method to alert the professor without drawing attention. Friends are split: some think it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's harsh because school is hard and cheating leads to failure.\n\nThe key points here are academic honesty, the method used to report (which was respectful and discreet), and the potential consequences. The person didn't act out of malice but to uphold the rules. The professor handled it, so the person isn't taking responsibility for the cheaters' failure\u2014just following protocol. \n\nIn most university settings, reporting cheating is a responsibility. The method was clever but appropriate. So the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
