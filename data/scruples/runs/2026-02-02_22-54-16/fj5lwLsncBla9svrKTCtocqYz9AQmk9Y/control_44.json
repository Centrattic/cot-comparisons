Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where the student noticed two people cheating\u2014using notecards and peeking at a friend's test. The student then wrote a note to the professor, went to the restroom, and the professor confirmed she dealt with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the university. If cheating is against the academic integrity policy, then reporting it is the right thing. The professor handled it, so the student followed the proper channel. \n\nBut there's the aspect of intention. The student wanted to ensure fairness by preventing cheating that could affect the curve. However, some might argue it's none of their business or that the cheaters were just struggling. But the professor's role is to enforce rules, so the student acted as a responsible person by reporting. \n\nAnother angle: did the student do this in a discreet way? They wrote a note and went to the bathroom, which is a respectful method. The professor then took action. The student didn't confront them directly or spread rumors. \n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the cheaters got what they deserved. The student's action prevented unfair advantage, which is just. Friends are divided, but the majority might side with the student acting correctly. \n\nNo evidence the student had a vendetta or did it out of spite. It was a report of misconduct. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
