Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two classmates for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a final exam, the author noticed someone had notecards and was looking at another's test. They wrote a note to the professor, went to the bathroom, and the professor caught the cheaters. Now friends are divided on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting cheating is generally seen as upholding academic integrity. Cheating is against university policies, so the professor would likely take action. The author's actions led to the cheaters being caught, which could prevent unfair advantages and maintain fairness for all students. On the other hand, some might argue that the author was interfering or being a \"snitch,\" especially if the cheaters had a hard time with the exam. But the professor's role is to enforce rules, so the author's action in this case seems justified. The key factors are that it was a final exam, the class curve could be affected, and the professor handled it. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
