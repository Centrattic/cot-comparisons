Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The situation is that the student noticed two classmates cheating and informed the professor, leading to them being caught and possibly failing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and universities have policies against it. If the student didn't cheat themselves and reported the violation, that's usually seen as the right thing to do. The professor's role is to maintain academic integrity, so trusting them to handle it is appropriate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the student overstepped by being the one to report it. But in academic settings, students are often encouraged to report misconduct. The method here was discreet\u2014writing a note and using the restroom as an excuse. That seems responsible and not confrontational.\n\nThe friends' divided opinions add context. Some think the cheaters deserved it for cheating, others feel it's harsh. But the student didn't cheat; they upheld the rules. The outcome was that the cheaters failed, which is a consequence of their actions, not the reporter's. \n\nAlso, the exam's difficulty and potential curve implications matter. Cheating could unfairly disadvantage others. By reporting, the student protected fair grading for the class. \n\nNo mention of personal motives here. The student didn't have a grudge. They acted to enforce academic standards. So the action aligns with ethical responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
