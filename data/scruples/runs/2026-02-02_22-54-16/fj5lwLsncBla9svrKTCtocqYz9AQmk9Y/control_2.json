Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a final exam, the person notices a classmate has notecards and then checks another's test. The professor is informed, and the cheaters are caught. Friends have mixed opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered unethical, and reporting it can be seen as upholding academic integrity. However, there's also the aspect of personal relationships and the potential consequences for the cheaters. The user might be worried about being labeled a snitch or if the situation was handled appropriately.\n\nThe university's policies on cheating are important. If the policy states that cheating leads to automatic failure, then the professor acting on the report is following protocol. The author's method of reporting\u2014using a restroom break to inform the professor\u2014might be seen as discreet and responsible. However, some might argue that it's better to speak up directly, but in a high-pressure exam setting, the author's approach could be justified to avoid confrontation.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the class curve. If the cheaters could have affected everyone's grades, reporting them might be in the interest of fairness. On the flip side, if the cheaters are now failing due to this, some might feel the author played a role in their academic failure.\n\nBut the key points here are the ethical duty to report misconduct and the potential for the cheaters to face consequences. Since the professor was informed and took action, the author fulfilled their responsibility. Friends' mixed opinions don't necessarily reflect the rightness of the action but rather differing personal views.\n\nI think the correct answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to maintain academic integrity within the rules set by the institution. However, it's possible that some might see it as interfering, but the institution's policies support the action.\n"
