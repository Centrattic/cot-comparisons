Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported the cheating in the exam was in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person noticed two students cheating during a final exam. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and informed the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters and they failed the class. The user thinks the author is right, but friends are split. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethical angles here. Cheating is generally considered dishonest and undermines academic integrity. The university probably has rules against it, and the professor is supposed to enforce those. The author took action to report the cheating, which is in line with maintaining fair standards. However, some might argue that the author was being a \"snitch\" or that school is hard and the cheaters might have been trying to cope. Others might say that it's the professor's job to catch cheaters without student intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, the professor did confirm she would handle it, and she did catch them herself. The author didn't confront the cheaters directly, just informed the professor. The method was discreet, using a note and the restroom trip, which shows the author considered not causing a scene during the exam. \n\nBut could there be a downside? Maybe the author overstepped by taking it upon themselves instead of trusting the professor to monitor the exam. However, the professor was watching them after the note, so maybe she was already aware but needed confirmation. The action led to the cheaters failing, which is a consequence they had to face for their actions. \n\nIn academic settings, integrity is crucial. Reporting cheating is often seen as the right thing to do because it ensures fairness for all students. The alternative is allowing cheating to go unchecked, which could harm others who studied hard. The author's action preserved the integrity of the exam and the course. \n\nSo, even though some friends think it's wrong, the ethical stance here supports the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
