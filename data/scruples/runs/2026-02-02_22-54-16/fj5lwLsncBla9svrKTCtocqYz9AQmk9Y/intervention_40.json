Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. The scenario is from a university final with around 30 students. The person noticed two students cheating: one had notecards under their test, then they poked their friend and leaned over to look at their test. The author wrote a note, went to the restroom, and told the professor. The professor then caught them in the act and the students didn't return. Friends are split on whether it was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Reporting cheating is generally seen as upholding academic integrity. Cheating is against university policies, so reporting it is a responsibility. The act of cheating could affect the class curve, which is a legitimate concern for the other students' grades. The author did it discreetly, which is smart to avoid confrontation and ensure the professor could handle it properly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being a \"snitch\" or that the cheaters were just stressed and desperate. But in academic settings, cheating is a serious offense, often leading to automatic failure. The professor's action of taking the tests and sending them out suggests the students were caught in the act, which supports the author's report.\n\nThe key points are: the author provided evidence (note with what they saw), took the proper channel (told the professor), and did so without unnecessary confrontation. The professor handled it, which means the author followed the correct procedure. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
