Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported cheating in an exam is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the person noticed two students using notecards and peeking at others' tests. The professor was informed discreetly, leading to the cheaters being caught and possibly failing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are academic integrity policies. In most universities, cheating is against the rules, and students are expected to report it. The author here didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have led to a conflict or escalation. Instead, they informed the professor, which is the proper procedure. The professor then handled the situation, so the author didn't take matters into their own hands beyond reporting.\n\nSome might argue that the author was too involved, but in academic settings, maintaining the integrity of assessments is crucial. Cheating affects everyone, including the curve, so reporting it could be seen as upholding fairness. The author's method of reporting discreetly (using the bathroom break) shows consideration to avoid public confrontation, which is commendable.\n\nHowever, others might say that the author was overstepping by getting involved. But according to standard academic policies, students are encouraged to report cheating. The professor confirmed the action by writing on the test, which validates the proper procedure. The friends' mixed reactions are common, but the rightness of the action is more about the institution's rules rather than peer opinions.\n\nCheating leads to automatic failure, so the cheaters' outcome is a consequence of their actions. The author didn't make them fail; the system did. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
