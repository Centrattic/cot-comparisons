Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported others for cheating on a final exam is in the wrong. The situation is from a university setting, so academic integrity policies are likely in place. \n\nFirst, the person noticed cheating, not just a suspicion but actual notecards and leaning over to see another's test. Cheating on exams is a serious offense, especially in a class with a curve that affects everyone. The student took action by informing the professor in a discreet way, which the professor acknowledged and handled. The professor then caught the cheaters, and they didn't return, presumably failing the class.\n\nNow, the user's friends are split. Some say it's right because cheating is wrong, others say it's wrong because school is hard. The key here is whether the student acted appropriately. Reporting cheating is generally expected in academic settings to maintain fairness. The student didn't confront the cheaters directly, which could have caused a scene, but instead went to the professor. That's a responsible action. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student was being a \"snitch\" or that the cheaters might have been under stress. However, the university's policies usually prioritize integrity, so the student's action aligns with those policies. The professor handled it, so the student didn't overstep by confronting them themselves.\n\nCheating undermines the value of education for everyone. By reporting it, the student is protecting the fairness of the grading system. The method used was discreet and respectful, avoiding public confrontation. So, the student isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
