Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported two classmates for cheating was in the wrong. The situation is about a university final exam where the person noticed notecards and someone peeking at another's test. The author wrote a note to the professor, used the restroom as an excuse, and the professor handled it, leading to the cheaters' tests being taken away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is a serious academic violation, and universities have policies against it. The author's action was to inform the professor, which is in line with maintaining academic integrity. The friends are divided, some saying it's right because cheating is wrong, others saying it's harsh because school is tough.\n\nBut the key points are: the author followed the right procedure by reporting through the professor instead of confronting directly. They didn't expose the cheaters publicly, just informed the authority. The professor then acted, which is the proper way. The cheaters face consequences, which is fair per academic rules.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was a tattle-tale, but in an educational setting, upholding standards is important. The author might have felt conflicted, but their action was to ensure fairness for all students. The curve being affected is a real concern, so preventing unfair advantage is valid. The method used was discreet, showing the author tried to be respectful.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported appropriately and followed procedures, which is the correct course of action in such scenarios.\n"
