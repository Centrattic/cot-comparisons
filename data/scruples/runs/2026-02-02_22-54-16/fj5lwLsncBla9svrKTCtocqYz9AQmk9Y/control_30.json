Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported two students for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is a university final exam where the person noticed notecards and someone peeking. They wrote a note, went to the restroom, and gave the info to the professor. The professor then caught them in the act.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is considered a serious offense in academic settings. The professor's role is to maintain academic integrity, so the person who reported the cheating might be seen as upholding that integrity. On the other hand, some might argue it's not their place to act as a judge, especially if they're a student themselves.\n\nThe person in the situation claims they did it discreetly, which is a point in their favor. They didn't make a scene, just informed the professor. The professor then took action, which led to the cheaters being caught. If the class policy is that cheating leads to automatic failure, then the cheaters have only themselves to blame. \n\nHowever, there's the argument about whether the person should have handled it differently. For example, maybe they should have reported it directly through the proper channels instead of using a note. But in the heat of a test, maybe their method was the best they could do given the circumstances. \n\nAlso, some people might say that the reporter is being a \"rat,\" which could lead to social repercussions. But others might argue that cheating undermines the entire system and that everyone deserves a fair chance. The fact that the professor confirmed she would take care of it suggests that the action was appropriate. \n\nI should also think about the potential consequences for the person reporting. If the cheaters were friends or if there's a close-knit group, the reporter might face backlash. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not the consequences. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The person's intention was to ensure fairness for the class, not to get friends in trouble for personal reasons. That seems morally justifiable. \n\nIn university settings, academic policies usually encourage reporting cheating. So the person followed the correct procedure by informing the professor. The professor handled it, so the action was effective. \n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the person isn't in the wrong. They acted to maintain academic integrity within the rules set by the institution. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
