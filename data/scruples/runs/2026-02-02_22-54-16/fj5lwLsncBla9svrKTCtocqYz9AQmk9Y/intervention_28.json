Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about reporting two students for cheating is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author noticed someone had notecards under their test and then leaned over to look at another student's test. They wrote a note, asked to go to the bathroom, and informed the professor. The professor then caught the cheaters, and they didn't return. The friends are split: some say it's right because cheating is bad, others say it's wrong because school is hard.\n\nI need to decide if the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. Cheating is against academic integrity policies, so reporting it is usually expected. The author took a discreet approach to inform the professor without causing a scene, which might be commendable. By giving the professor time to monitor and catch them in the act, they provided evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a judgment call if the cheaters were struggling and resorted to cheating. However, the rules are clear in the scenario: cheating leads to automatic failure. The author's action upholds academic standards. Friends' opinions are mixed, but the key is whether the action aligns with institutional policies and moral duty.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a responsibility to maintain fair assessment. Cheating affects others by altering the curve, which the author mentioned. Their action prevented unfair advantage. Also, the method of reporting was clever to avoid confrontation, which might have been necessary to catch the cheaters in the act.\n\nNo direct harm to the cheaters beyond the consequence of their actions. The author didn't tattle for revenge but acted on principle. So, considering all this, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
