Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who reported cheating in their final exam is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person noticed two students using notecards and looking at each other's tests during an exam. They wrote a note to the professor, discreetly handed their test to her, and the professor eventually caught the cheaters. The friends are divided on whether this was right or wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, cheating is a serious issue. Academic integrity is usually a priority in educational institutions. If the professor has a policy of automatic failure for cheating, then the students who cheated might have deserved that outcome. The person who reported them could be seen as upholding the rules, which is a positive action. However, some might argue that it's a harsh outcome to fail someone, especially if the exam was difficult.\n\nBut the key points here are that the person acted within the framework of the school's policies. They didn't confront the cheaters directly or spread rumors; they discreetly informed the professor, who then handled it. That's probably the correct procedure. Cheating undermines the educational process and fairness for others, so reporting it is generally considered the right thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might say that the reporter is being a \"rat\" and that it's a harsh judgment to fail someone over cheating. But in most academic settings, cheating is a clear violation, and the responsibility to report it lies with all students. The reporter here took a responsible action without escalating the situation beyond the professor's involvement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B: No, the author is not in the wrong. They acted appropriately by following the proper channels to report cheating, which maintains academic integrity.\n"
