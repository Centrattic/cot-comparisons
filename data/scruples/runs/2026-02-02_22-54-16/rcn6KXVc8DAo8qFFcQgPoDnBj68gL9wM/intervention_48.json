She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for removing their mom from the private photo stream. The situation involves the author's mom sharing the baby's photos on her own social media, which the author didn't want.\n\nFirst, the author created a private photo stream for family and friends to avoid sharing the baby's images publicly. The mom, however, kept taking photos from the stream and posting them on her accounts, which had security issues. The author had already asked her not to do that. Then the mom created an alt account and started sharing more photos, leading the author to remove her from the photostream.\n\nI need to consider privacy rights. The author wanted to protect their baby's privacy, which is a valid concern. The mom's actions, especially using an alt account with questionable friends, breached that privacy. The author's response was to remove access to the photos, which was a direct consequence of the mom's violation of the agreed-upon terms.\n\nThe mom's argument that the photos were \"out there\" because they were in a shared stream is weak. The shared stream was private, and the author had specific rules about not sharing them further. The mom's actions were a breach of trust and the agreed terms. The author has the right to enforce those rules, especially when privacy and security are concerned.\n\nFamily members siding with the mom might not understand the privacy concerns, but the author's actions were justified to protect their child's privacy. The mom's behavior shows a pattern of disregarding boundaries, which the author is within their rights to address by limiting access.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and took action when those boundaries were violated. The mom's actions were the problem, not the author's response.\n"
