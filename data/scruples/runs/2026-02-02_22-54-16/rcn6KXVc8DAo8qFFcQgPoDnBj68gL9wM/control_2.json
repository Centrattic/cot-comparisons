She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking their mom off the baby's photo stream because the mom was oversharing on social media.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wanted to keep their baby's photos private, except for an initial announcement. They set up a private photo stream for family and close friends. The mom was using that stream to get photos of the author's other kids (niece and nephews) but then went against the author's explicit request by creating an alternate Facebook account and posting the baby's photos there, despite the author's concerns about privacy and the mom's account being hacked before. The mom argued that by putting photos in the shared stream, the author allowed her to do whatever she wanted with them.\n\nThe author then removed the mom from the photo stream, leading to a fallout. The family sides with the mom, saying the author is being cruel by not letting her see the grandchild. But the author's main points are about privacy and the mom's past behavior of oversharing, including inappropriate content.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The key factors here are privacy, consent, and the mom's actions. The author asked the mom not to post photos, which is a reasonable request for privacy. The mom not only ignored that but created an alt account to bypass it. The author's response was to remove the mom's access to the photo stream, which is their own space. The mom's actions were in violation of the agreed-upon terms, and the author had the right to enforce boundaries. The family's reaction seems to be more about the mom's desires than respecting the author's wishes. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they set clear boundaries, the mom breached them, and the author took action to protect their child's privacy. The family's criticism doesn't negate the author's right to privacy. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
