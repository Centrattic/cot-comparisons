She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for removing their mom from a private photo stream because the mom shared the baby's pictures on Facebook against their request.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author wanted to keep their baby's photos private, only sharing a brief announcement. They set up a private photostream for family and friends. The mom, however, was taking photos from there and posting them on her Facebook and Instagram. The author specifically asked her not to, citing privacy concerns and the risk of hacked accounts. The mom then created an alternate account to post the photos anyway, which the author discovered and confronted her about. The author kicked her off the photostream, leading to a rift.\n\nSo, the main issues are privacy, consent, and the mom's actions despite being asked. The author's stance is about protecting their child's privacy and security. The mom's defense that by sharing the photos in a private stream, they were available for her to use is a key point. But a private stream implies that access is granted to specific people for a controlled purpose, not for redistribution. The mom's repeated overstepping, including past incidents of oversharing, supports the author's decision.\n\nThe family's side with the mom, but the author's actions were a response to a breach of trust. The author's right to control their child's image and privacy seems valid here. The mom's actions were inconsiderate and violated the agreed terms. So, the author is justified in their actions. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
