She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a 6-month-old baby and created a private photo stream for family and friends to see the baby without sharing on social media. The mom is part of this photo stream but keeps posting pics on her Facebook and Instagram. The author asked her not to share the baby's photos because they want privacy and because the mom's account has been hacked before. The mom initially agreed but then made an alternate account to post the baby's photos. The author found out, confronted her, and kicked her off the photo stream. Now the mom hasn't visited in two weeks, and the rest of the family sides with her, thinking the author is being cruel.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They explicitly told the mom not to share the baby's photos, and the mom violated that trust. Even though the photo stream was shared, the author didn't intend for the photos to be shared further. The mom's actions of creating an alt account and posting the photos without consent is a breach of that agreement. The author had valid reasons for wanting privacy, especially given security issues with the mom's account.\n\nThe mom's argument that the photos were in the stream and thus fair game is weak. The stream was meant for close family and friends to view privately, not for the mom to redistribute. The author didn't give permission for the photos to be posted online. The mom's actions were disrespectful and disregarded the author's wishes, even after being explicitly told not to. \n\nThe family's support of the mom might be because they don't see the privacy concerns, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their child's privacy. Kicking the mom off the stream was a reasonable response to protect that privacy after the breach of trust. The mom's lack of respect for the author's wishes and the subsequent actions (creating a private alt account) only reinforce the author's stance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to enforce their boundaries after the mom violated them. The answer should be B.\n"
