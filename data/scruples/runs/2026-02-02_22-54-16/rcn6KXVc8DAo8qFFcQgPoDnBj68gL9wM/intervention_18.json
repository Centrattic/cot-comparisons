She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author kicking their mom off a private photo stream because the mom was sharing the baby's photos on her own social media against the author's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted to keep the baby's photos private except for a private photo stream for family and friends. The mom, however, was using the photo stream to post on her Facebook and Instagram, which had been hacked before and had questionable friends. The author had already asked her not to share the baby's photos, and the mom initially agreed but then created an alternate account to post more photos. That's when the author removed her from the photo stream, leading to a two-week silence.\n\nSo, the main issue is about privacy and consent. The author had set boundaries because of privacy concerns and security issues with the mom's account. The mom, despite being asked not to share, did so anyway, which led to the author taking action. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author's action was to remove access to the photo stream, which is their own resource. The mom's behavior was in violation of the author's explicit request and contributed to potential privacy breaches. The author's main concern was protecting the baby's privacy, which is a valid and common concern, especially given the mom's history of oversharing and security issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that she had access to the photos through the shared stream and felt entitled to share them. But the author had set clear boundaries, and the mom's actions were a breach of trust. The author's response was to remove the access, which is a direct consequence of the violation. Family members siding with the mom might see it as harsh, but the author's priority is the child's privacy.\n\nI think the author is justified in their actions. They had legitimate concerns and took reasonable steps to protect their child. The mom's actions were the breach, not the author's response. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
