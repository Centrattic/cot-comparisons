She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby photo stream. The situation involves privacy concerns because the mom shared the baby's photos on social media despite being asked not to. \n\nFirst, the author set up a private photostream to share baby photos with close family and friends. They specifically asked the mom not to post any photos of the baby on her social media accounts. The mom agreed but then created an alternate account and started sharing the baby's photos there, including some the author hadn't even seen before. This led to a conflict where the author felt their privacy was violated.\n\nThe author's main points are about privacy and protecting their child's images. They mention that the mom's Facebook account has been hacked before and has questionable friends, which adds to the concern. Even though the author kicked the mom from the photostream, their extended family is siding with the mom, thinking the author is being cruel by withholding access to the photos.\n\nNow, considering privacy rights, parents have the right to control how their child's images are shared. The mom's actions, despite being given a private photostream, went against the author's wishes. The fact that the mom created an alt account and shared photos without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. The author's response was to revoke access, which is a reasonable action to protect their child's privacy, especially given the mom's history of oversharing and prior incidents like posting inappropriate photos.\n\nThe family's reaction is also a factor. While family support matters, the author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being, which includes safeguarding their privacy. The mom's access to the baby isn't being restricted in terms of physical visits; she's just not getting the photos via the shared stream. That seems fair because the author isn't preventing in-person interactions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the author had the right to set boundaries regarding their child's photos. The mom's actions were a violation of those agreed-upon terms, so the author acting to enforce the rules isn't wrong. The mom's argument that the photos were in the shared stream doesn't negate the mutual understanding that those photos wouldn't be used on social media. \n\nOverall, the author's actions were in response to a breach of trust and privacy concerns. They had a valid reason to remove the mom from the photostream to prevent further unauthorized sharing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
