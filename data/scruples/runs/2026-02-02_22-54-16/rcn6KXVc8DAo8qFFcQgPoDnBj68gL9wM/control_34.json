She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about sharing baby photos. The author has a private photo stream for family and friends, and they specifically asked their mom not to post the baby's pictures on her social media. The mom agreed but then created an alternate account and posted the photos anyway. The author then kicked the mom off the photo stream, and now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They wanted to keep their baby's photos private and had set up a private stream for that purpose. The mom, however, despite being asked not to, shared the photos on her own accounts, which she had previously been hacked and had questionable friends. So the author has valid reasons for wanting to protect their child's privacy. \n\nThe mom's actions seem to be a breach of trust. Even though she was given access to the photo stream, she used it to post photos against the author's wishes. Creating an alternate account to share those photos shows a disregard for the author's boundaries. The author's response was to remove the mom from the photo stream, which is a reasonable reaction to prevent further unauthorized sharing.\n\nThe family's side is with the mom, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author's right to control their child's privacy should be respected. The mom's argument that the photos were \"out there\" because they were in the shared stream is invalid because the shared stream was intended for close family and friends, not for public sharing. \n\nAlso, the mom's history of oversharing and previous incidents, like posting inappropriate photos, supports the author's concerns. The author isn't being cruel by setting boundaries; they're protecting their child's privacy. The mom's actions were the breach, so the author isn't in the wrong for taking action.\n"
