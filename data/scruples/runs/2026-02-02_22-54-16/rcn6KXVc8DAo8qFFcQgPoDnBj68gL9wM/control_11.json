She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether they're the asshole for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream because the mom shared the photos on her own Facebook account despite being asked not to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author set up a private photo stream for family and close friends to share baby pictures. The mom was part of this, but she's known for oversharing on social media. The author specifically asked her not to post any photos of the baby, citing privacy and security concerns (mom's account has been hacked before and has questionable friends). The mom agreed but then created an alt account to post the baby's photos anyway, including ones not from the photo stream. The author found out, confronted her, but the mom refused to deactivate the account. The author then removed the mom from the photo stream, leading to a two-week silence.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author created the photo stream as a private, controlled way to share photos. They explicitly told the mom not to share them publicly. The mom, however, went against that by creating an alt account and posting the photos. The author has valid reasons for wanting privacy\u2014both personal and due to the security issues with the mom's accounts. The mom's actions violate the trust and the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nThe mom's argument that by putting photos in the stream, the author allowed her to use them as she wished is flawed. The author's intention was to keep the photos private among a specific group, not for public sharing. The mom's actions were a breach of that trust. The author's response of removing the mom from the photo stream is a reasonable step to protect their child's privacy after the mom broke the agreed boundaries.\n\nFamily members siding with the mom might not understand the privacy concerns, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The mom's actions were a direct violation of the author's wishes, which justifies the author's decision to take action. The author isn't being cruel for protecting their child's privacy; the mom is the one who chose to disregard the request. The author's action was a necessary step to prevent further unauthorized sharing, especially considering the security risks involved.\n"
