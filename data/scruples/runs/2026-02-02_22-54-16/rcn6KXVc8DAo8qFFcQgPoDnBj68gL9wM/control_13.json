She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mom who's sharing her granddaughter's photos on social media without permission, right? The author set up a private photo stream for family and friends to see the baby, but the author's mom is using that stream to post on her own accounts. The mom then made an alternate account to post even more photos, which the author found out about and got upset. The author kicked the mom off the photostream and hasn't spoken since.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They wanted to keep their baby's photos private, which is understandable. The mom, however, has a history of oversharing, including inappropriate photos. The mom's accounts have been hacked, and she has questionable friends, which adds risk. The author tried to set boundaries but the mom didn't respect them, even creating a secret account. \n\nThe mom's argument was that by sharing the photos in the stream, the author \"put them out there\" for her to use. But that's a flawed reasoning because the photostream was meant to be private and shared only with close family and friends. The mom's use of an alt account to broadcast the baby's photos without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's response was to remove the mom from the photostream. While that cut off the mom's access, maybe there could have been a more direct conversation or involving the rest of the family to mediate. However, given the mom's history and the fact that she continued to violate privacy by making a new account, the author's actions seem justified. The author is protecting their child's privacy, which is a valid and responsible action. The family's support for the author is also a factor, but the main issue is about consent and respecting boundaries. The mom's actions were reckless, and the author's response was a necessary step to maintain control over their child's personal information.\n"
