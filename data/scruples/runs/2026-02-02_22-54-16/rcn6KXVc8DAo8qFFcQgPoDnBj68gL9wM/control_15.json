She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a parent who created a private photo stream for their baby to share with family and friends. The mom, who had access to this stream, ended up using it to post photos on her own social media, despite being asked not to. The mom then created an alternate account to continue sharing the baby's photos. The author kicked the mom off the photo stream, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and consent. The author explicitly asked the mom not to share the baby's photos on social media due to privacy concerns and security risks (hacked accounts, questionable friends). The mom agreed but later violated that agreement by using an alt account. The author's action of removing her from the photo stream seems like a reasonable response to protect their child's privacy, especially given the mom's history of oversharing. \n\nThe mom's argument that the photos were available in the stream implies that by sharing them there, the author implicitly allowed her to do anything. However, the stream was meant for family and close friends, not public sharing. The mom's actions were a breach of trust and the original agreement. The author had the right to set boundaries, and the mom's continued disregard for those boundaries justifies the author's decision to remove her.\n\nAdditionally, the author's concern about privacy is valid. The baby's photos being on a potentially insecure account with unknown friends is a legitimate risk. The fact that the author has a 45-minute distance from the mom doesn't negate the right to privacy. The mom can visit in person, which is a more direct way to share the child's life.\n\nFamily members siding with the mom might be misunderstanding the situation, thinking the author is being cruel by not allowing photos. However, the author's actions are about protecting their child's privacy, not withholding access. The mom's actions were a violation, so the author isn't in the wrong for defending that boundary. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted appropriately to protect their child's privacy after repeated breaches. The mom's actions were disrespectful and violated the trust, so the author is not the asshole here.\n"
