She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author kicked their mom off a private photo stream because the mom shared their baby's photos on her own social media, despite being asked not to. The mom created an alternate account to continue sharing, which the author found out about and took action.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the privacy aspect. The author wanted to keep their baby's photos private, which is a valid concern. They set up a private stream for close family and friends, which makes sense to control who sees the photos. The mom, however, violated that trust by posting the photos on her main accounts and even created an alt account. This shows a lack of respect for the author's wishes. \n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The family sides with the mom, thinking the author is being cruel by not allowing her access. But the author isn't withholding visitation; the mom lives nearby and can visit. The shared photos were the main point of contention, not physical access. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to a breach of trust. They had legitimate reasons to be concerned about privacy and the security of their child's photos, especially given the mom's history of oversharing and having a hacked account. Removing the mom from the photo stream was a reasonable step to protect their baby's privacy after the mom failed to comply with their initial request.\n\nThe mom's argument that the photos were available in the shared stream doesn't hold because the stream was meant for a specific group, not for public or unrestricted sharing. The author had the right to set boundaries for how the photos are used. The fact that the mom continued to share despite being asked, and even created an alt account, shows a pattern of disregard for the author's wishes.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their child's privacy after the mom violated agreed-upon terms. The answer should be B.\n"
