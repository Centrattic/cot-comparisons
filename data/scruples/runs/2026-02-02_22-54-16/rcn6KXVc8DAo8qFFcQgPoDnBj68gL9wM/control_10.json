She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for removing their mom from the baby's photo stream. The author is trying to protect their baby's privacy because the mom has a history of oversharing on social media, even after being asked not to. The mom created an alternate account and shared photos despite the request, which led to the author kicking her off the photostream.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is privacy. They wanted to limit photos of their baby to a private stream for family and friends. The mom, however, repeatedly shared photos on her accounts, even after being told not to. The mom's accounts have security issues, like being hacked and having questionable friends. The author had a valid reason to be concerned about privacy and safety.\n\nThen there's the part where the mom made an alt account and shared photos again, which is a breach of trust. The author had a right to protect their child's information. The mom's argument that the photos were available in the stream doesn't hold because the stream was private and intended for specific people, not for public sharing. The author's action of removing the mom was a response to a violation of their trust.\n\nOther family members siding with the mom might indicate a family pressure aspect, but the author's primary responsibility is to their child's privacy. The mom's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. The fact that the mom hasn't visited since the argument might be a consequence, but the author's action was a reaction to the mom's repeated breaches.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate reason to protect their child's privacy and took action after the mom broke their trust again. So the answer should be B.\n"
