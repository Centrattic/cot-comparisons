She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking their mom off the baby's photo stream because the mom was oversharing on Facebook. The author set up a private photo stream for family and friends, but the mom used an alt account to share the baby's photos publicly, despite being asked not to. The author then removed the mom from the stream.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The mom was explicitly told not to share the baby's photos, but she went against that by creating an alternate account. The author had valid privacy concerns, especially since the mom's account had been hacked before. The mom's actions showed a disregard for the author's wishes and the baby's privacy. The author's response was to remove her from the photo stream, which seems like a direct consequence for the breach of trust. \n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were a reaction to the mom's violation of agreed-upon boundaries. The mom was given a private way to view photos but chose to misuse it. The author's decision to cut off access could be seen as protecting their child's privacy. On the other hand, some might argue that the mom was trying to stay connected, but her method was inappropriate. However, the author had already set clear rules, and the mom didn't respect them. The author's response is a form of enforcing those boundaries, not necessarily cruel withholding. The author's priority is the child's privacy and safety, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe family's side with the mom, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author's actions were in response to a breach of trust and privacy. The mom's creation of an alt account with questionable security is a major issue. So, the author isn't the one at fault here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
