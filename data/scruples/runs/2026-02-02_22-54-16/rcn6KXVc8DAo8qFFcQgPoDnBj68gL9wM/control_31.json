She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom\u2019s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it\u2019s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don\u2019t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It\u2019s been two weeks, and we haven\u2019t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she\u2019s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew\u2019s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt\u2019s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it\u2019s cruel I am \u201cwithholding the opportunity\u201d for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn\u2019t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won\u2019t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about privacy and family dynamics. The author has a 6-month-old baby and has been careful not to share photos on social media except once. They created a private photo stream for family and friends. The mom, however, keeps sharing the baby's photos on her social media despite being asked not to. The author found out the mom created an alternate account to post these photos, leading to a conflict. The author then removed the mom from the photo stream, and they haven't talked in two weeks.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is privacy. They specifically asked their mom not to share the baby's photos, citing past hacking issues and questionable friends. The mom didn't follow through, even after the author's request. The author's action of removing their mom from the photo stream seems like a reasonable response to protect their child's privacy, especially since the mom violated trust by creating an alternate account. \n\nThe mom's argument is that by putting photos on the shared stream, the author implicitly allowed her to use them. However, the shared stream was set up by the author's brother, and the author had explicitly asked the mom not to post any of the baby's photos. The mom's actions went against that explicit request, which is a breach of privacy. The author has the right to control who has access to their photos and how they're shared. \n\nThe family's support for the mom is a red flag. They think the author is being cruel for \"withholding\" access. But the author isn't withholding visits; the mom lives nearby but hasn't visited. The real issue is the unauthorized sharing of private content. The author's decision to remove the mom from the photo stream is a direct consequence of the mom's violation of trust and the author's need to protect their child's privacy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are justified. The mom violated a clear request, and the author took necessary steps to prevent further breaches. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
