I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mother to stay with them before and after the baby's birth. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first, and he wants to invite his own mother for support. The girlfriend responds by dismissing his need for support, saying he doesn't have to do the \"real work\" (implying childbirth).\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author mentions that his girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying, which is a significant decision affecting their shared home. Good communication is key in relationships, especially during major life events like having a baby. Not discussing such a big change without input from the partner could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nNext, the author's reaction. He points out that he wants support too, which is valid. Childbirth is a big deal for both parents, even if the physical work of childbirth is on the mother. Emotional and practical support for the father or partner is also important. The girlfriend's response dismisses his needs, which could be hurtful and unfair.\n\nThen there's the aspect of shared living space. If they live together, decisions about hosting family should be mutual. The girlfriend's unilateral decision might not respect the author's role in the household. The author's desire to invite his mother for support is reasonable, especially if the home is shared.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author overreacted. Maybe the girlfriend had her reasons for not consulting him, like thinking it's an obvious support need. But even so, communication is crucial. The girlfriend's dismissal of his support needs is problematic because it undermines his feelings and contributions.\n\nIn terms of cultural or social norms, it's common for new parents to seek support from family. Both partners should feel their needs are acknowledged. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh and dismissive, which might indicate a larger issue in their communication style.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's desire for support is valid. The girlfriend should have discussed her plans with him. The author's response to propose his own support is a reasonable reaction. The girlfriend's dismissal is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support and bringing it up, especially since communication was lacking. The main fault might lie with the girlfriend, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author isn't the one who dismissed support, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
