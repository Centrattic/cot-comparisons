      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy in the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mom to stay with them for support, but didn't consult him first. The guy feels left out because he wasn't asked, and he responded by suggesting his mom come over too, which she dismissed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy and childbirth are significant life events, and it's common for partners to seek support. The girlfriend's request for her mother is about support, which she's entitled to. However, not discussing it with her partner first could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they share a home. Shared living spaces usually require mutual agreement on guests, especially long-term ones.\n\nThe guy's reaction is to want his mother to come as well, which makes sense if he feels his support is also important. But when she calls him an asshole, that's a problem. His response might have been a bit confrontational, but the core issue is about both needing support and communication. \n\nThe girlfriend's dismissal that the guy doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor is a bit dismissive. Childbirth is a shared experience, and both partners go through significant changes. The guy's need for support isn't less valid just because he's not the one giving birth. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He was upset about not being consulted and wanted to have his own support. His response might have been a bit defensive, but the main issue is communication and mutual consideration. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, and her not consulting him first was a mistake. The guy's request to include his mother is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
