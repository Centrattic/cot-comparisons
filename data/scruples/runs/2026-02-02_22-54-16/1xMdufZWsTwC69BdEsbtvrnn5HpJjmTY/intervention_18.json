I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend asked her mom to stay for several weeks before and after the baby's birth without consulting him. When he pointed out that he should invite his mother too, she dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging, so seeking support from family is understandable. However, not discussing it with her partner first might be an oversight. The author's request for his mother to help is valid because he's part of the family unit and should have a say in household decisions. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth seems dismissive and unfair. It undermines his role and contributions, especially since he's sharing the home and will also be involved in childcare.\n\nLegally and socially, partnerships should involve mutual decision-making. Not including the partner in significant decisions can lead to resentment. The girlfriend's reaction is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the partner's role in the upcoming changes. The author is asserting his right to have his needs considered, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic because she didn't include him in the decision and her response was disrespectful. The key points are shared responsibility in a partnership and mutual respect. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
