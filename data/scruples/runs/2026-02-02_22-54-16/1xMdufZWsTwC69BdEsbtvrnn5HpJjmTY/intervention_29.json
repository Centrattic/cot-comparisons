Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend has asked her mom to live with them for several weeks before and after the baby's birth. The author is upset that she didn't consult him about this, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she dismissed his concern, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that the decision to have her mother stay was unilateral. In a shared home, major decisions should involve both partners. The girlfriend's argument that her mom is her support system is valid, but the author is also valid in feeling that his needs should be considered. The girlfriend's dismissive response\u2014calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support\u2014seems unfair. Parenting is a team effort, and both partners should feel supported. The author is asserting his right to have his support system involved, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is part of the problem here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The answer should be B.\n"
