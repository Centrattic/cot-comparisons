      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay for support, but the author feels left out and upset because she didn't consult him first. The girlfriend responds by saying the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is feeling like he's being excluded from a decision that affects their shared home. The girlfriend's mother is coming to stay for a significant period, which the author might see as a major change. The author's reaction is to mention inviting his own mother, but the girlfriend dismisses that by saying he doesn't need support.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that the decision wasn't made jointly. Even if the girlfriend has her reasons, not discussing it with her partner could be a problem. Sharing a home means both parties have a say in who is living there, especially for a month or more. The girlfriend's response might come off as dismissive of the author's feelings and contributions. \n\nBut then, pregnancy and childbirth are significant events. It's common for the expecting parent to have more immediate support needs. The author's role as a supportive partner could be in question here. If he's not taking initiative in helping, maybe the girlfriend is justified in seeking external support. However, the way she responded by calling him an asshole is unkind and could be seen as invalidating his feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's counter-proposal might be a bit of a reaction to feeling unappreciated. Maybe he's trying to assert that he also needs support. But the timing of the decision not to consult him first is a valid point. The author might be right to feel that his input is necessary for such a big life change in their home.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's going through a lot and needs help. If her mom is coming regardless, the author's role as a supportive partner is important. But the key here is communication. The author's main gripe is about not being asked first, which is a reasonable expectation in a shared living situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether he's being unreasonable in his response. If he's genuinely feeling unsupported and is trying to communicate that, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his reaction is more about wanting equal support when he's not actively contributing, that's a different angle. However, the girlfriend's harsh response and lack of consideration for his feelings might mean she's partially at fault. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one feeling left out and trying to address the lack of communication, it's more about her not involving him. The author's request to involve his mom could be his way of stating he's also part of the support system. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
