Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again. The person is upset because their girlfriend didn't ask him before inviting her mom to stay for several weeks around the baby's arrival. The girlfriend said her mom is her support. The author then suggests inviting his mom for support, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he won't be doing the \"real work.\"\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, which is a significant commitment. When he tries to propose his own support by inviting his mom, she dismisses him, which might be invalidating his role in the situation.\n\nI think both sides have points. The author is right to want to be involved in decisions affecting their home. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are more critical, but she should still involve her partner. However, the author's response of suggesting his mom without considering the existing dynamic might have been a mistake. But the core issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then he's wrong. If B, he's not. The girlfriend's response was dismissive and possibly invalidating. The author's initial frustration is about not being consulted, which is valid. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic, but the author's desire for support and inclusion is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
