      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for about two weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's part of the household. When he asked about it, she said her mom is her support. He then suggested inviting his mom too, but she called him an asshole and said he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work (like childbirth). \n\nHmm. The main issue here is about communication and feeling excluded. The author feels that since they share the home, decisions about extended family staying should involve both of them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that her support needs are different because she's the one carrying the baby and going through childbirth. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting support? Well, support in a relationship is mutual. Even though the girlfriend is the one giving birth, the author is going through a major life change too. He might need help adjusting, especially if his mom's presence would be beneficial. The fact that the girlfriend didn't consult him first could be a problem. Communication is key in any relationship, so not discussing such a significant change might be her fault. However, the author's response might also be a bit abrupt. Instead of immediately suggesting his mom, maybe he should have discussed why her mom's support is important and how they can both feel supported. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling him an asshole is not a good way to handle the conversation. Also, dismissing his need for support because he's not the one giving birth could be invalidating. Both parents need emotional and practical support during pregnancy and after the baby arrives. The author's request might be valid, and the girlfriend's response is what's really problematic here. \n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, it's possible that both have some responsibility. But according to the question, we need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author wanted to be included in the decision and also wanted his own support. That seems reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is more aggressive and dismissive, which suggests that she's the one being unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have his say and for needing support. The answer should be B (No).\n"
