Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the girlfriend is asking her mom to stay for a few weeks, and the author didn't know about it. When he brought up not being asked, she dismissed him and said he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" The author wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The home is shared, so involving the other partner in major decisions makes sense. The girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom's stay, which is a significant change in their living situation. The author's reaction is to ask if his mom can also stay for support. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and condescending, which seems unfair.\n\nThe author's request for support is valid. Having a new baby is a big life event, and both partners might need help. The girlfriend's argument that only she needs support because she's the one giving birth is problematic. It undermines the author's feelings and the fact that he's going to be a parent too, facing changes and possible stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting his mom's support? Probably not. He's expressing his need for help, just like his partner. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. The key points are communication and mutual support. The author isn't wrong for wanting to involve his family; he's trying to address his own needs. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's dismissiveness rather than the author's desire for support.\n"
