Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay for support. The author didn't like that his girlfriend didn't consult him first, and when he suggested his mom should also come for support, she responded negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The home is shared, so decisions about who stays should probably be mutual. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which might be a point of contention. The author is upset about being excluded from the decision-making process. Then, when he proposes bringing in his own mom, she dismisses him, implying his role isn't as important. That seems unfair because both parents are involved in the child's life, even if the physical labor of childbirth is on the mother. The emotional and practical support for the father is also important.\n\nThe girlfriend's response might be rooted in her own stress and the fact that she's the one giving birth, which is a major life event. But dismissing his need for support could create tension. The author's request for support is valid because parenting is a shared responsibility, and having support from both sides can help. However, the way he brought it up might come off as confrontational if he didn't approach it with empathy.\n\nBut looking at the core issue: the author is advocating for his needs and feeling unheard. The girlfriend didn't include him in the initial decision, which is a problem because it's their shared home. The author's reaction is about wanting equality in support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's dismissal is problematic because it undermines his role. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
