Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e?) is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's part of the household. When he points this out, she dismisses his need for support and calls him an asshole.\n\nSo, the author wants support, but the girlfriend doesn't acknowledge that his role in the pregnancy and upcoming fatherhood might also require support. She's focused on her own needs, which is understandable, but maybe she's not considering his perspective. The key points here are communication and mutual support in a partnership. \n\nThe author didn't do anything wrong by expressing his feelings and wanting his mother to be there for support. It's reasonable to expect that both parents would have their support systems during such a significant life change. The girlfriend's reaction is dismissive and invalidating, which isn't helpful. However, the author's action of suggesting his mother's involvement is a reasonable response to feeling left out of the decision-making process. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong here. The issue stems from a lack of communication and mutual consideration. The girlfriend's behavior is the main problem, not the author's desire for support. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
