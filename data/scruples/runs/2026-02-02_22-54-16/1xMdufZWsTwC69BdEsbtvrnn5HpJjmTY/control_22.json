      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first since they share the home. When he asks about it, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests inviting his mom too, and she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work (presumably childbirth).\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is going through pregnancy and childbirth, which is a significant life event and can be physically and emotionally taxing. It's common for people to seek support during such times. Her wanting her mom to stay makes sense for emotional and practical help. However, the author feels left out of the decision-making process because they live together. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she didn't ask him about her mom staying, which affects their shared living space. This is a valid concern. Shared living spaces require mutual agreement, especially when introducing others into the home for an extended period. So, she should have discussed this with him. \n\nWhen the author suggests inviting his mom too, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth. This is where the conflict arises. Her response is harsh and invalidates his feelings. The author is expressing a need for support, which is reasonable. Even though he's not giving birth, having a new baby is a huge change, and support for both parents is important. Her reaction of calling him an asshole is unkind and undermines his concerns.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? He wants to have his mom stay for support, which is a normal request. The fact that he's trying to mirror her request shows he wants to share the support equally. However, the way he phrased it might come off as a bit confrontational, but given the context, it's a response to her not including him in the decision. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate openly about major changes in their shared home. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay, which is a key issue. The author's frustration is justified because his input matters. On the other hand, his reaction of suggesting his mom as well could be seen as a bit of a countermove, but her response was unnecessarily harsh.\n\nOverall, the girlfriend's actions were the initial problem by not discussing the live-in support with her partner. The author's request for support is valid, and her dismissive reaction is where the real issue lies. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here because he's seeking a fair and balanced approach to shared support during a significant life event. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not including him and for her harsh response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
