Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they wanted support from their mom as well after the girlfriend's mom is coming over to help. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author feels left out because they weren't consulted, even though they share the home. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, saying the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (the pregnancy/birth). \n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and mutual support. The author didn't get a say in the decision about the mother-in-law staying, which is a big deal since they live together. When the author suggests bringing in his own mom for support, the girlfriend reacts negatively, implying he's being unreasonable. \n\nThe author is asserting his need for support, which is valid. Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful for both partners, even if the non-pregnant partner isn't giving birth. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of the author's feelings and contributions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong. He's expressing his needs and wanting to be involved in decision-making about their shared home. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't consider his perspective initially and then dismissed his request. So, the author's actions seem reasonable. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Could the author have approached it differently? Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or with more empathy. But the main issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication and the dismissive attitude towards his support needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's response and lack of consideration for his feelings.\n"
