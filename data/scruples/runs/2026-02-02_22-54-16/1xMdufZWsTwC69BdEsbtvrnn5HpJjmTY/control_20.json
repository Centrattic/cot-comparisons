Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple expecting a baby, and the girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for about two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author, the guy, is upset because she didn't ask him first and then dismissed his request to have his mom stay as well, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they share the home, so he should have been consulted. The girlfriend's response is that her mom is her support, implying that she needs emotional and physical help during pregnancy and after the baby arrives. The guy then suggests his mom should come too, but she says he doesn't need support. That seems dismissive and possibly unfair.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? He's being asked to share his home with his girlfriend's mother, which is a big decision affecting both of them. He should have been included in that discussion. His reaction to want his mom's support is reasonable because both parents might need help. However, his tone might have been an issue if he came off as confrontational. But given the girlfriend's dismissive response, maybe his reaction is justified.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. Both partners should feel their needs are considered. The girlfriend's response invalidates his role and potential needs, which isn't healthy. The author's desire for support is valid, especially since he's part of the family now. The girlfriend's dismissal is problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his needs and the shared living situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
