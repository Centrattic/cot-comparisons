      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong when they wanted support from their mother after their girlfriend's mom is coming to stay. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend is pregnant and asked her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first since they share the home. He points out that support is important and that he should be allowed to have his mom stay too. The girlfriend responds by calling him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" during childbirth.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of a decision that affects their shared living space. It's reasonable for him to want to discuss such a significant plan with his partner. By not consulting him, she might have overstepped, especially since they're a couple and the house is shared. \n\nThen, when he suggests his own support system, her reaction seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful. Saying he's an asshole and minimizing his role in the baby's life by saying he's not doing real work is problematic. Support during pregnancy and postpartum is crucial for both partners, and expecting one to have help while dismissing the other's need for support can create an imbalance. \n\nThe author's request for his mother's support is valid. Both partners should feel supported, and the girlfriend's reaction seems unfair. She might be projecting her stress onto him. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this imbalance and for not being included in the initial decision. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
