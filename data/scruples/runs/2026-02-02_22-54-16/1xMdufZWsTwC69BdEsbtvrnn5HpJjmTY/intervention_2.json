Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a few weeks, but didn't ask the author first. The author feels left out and then suggests his mom should also come, but his girlfriend reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom coming over, which is a problem because they share a home. The author brings up his own need for support by suggesting his mom, but she dismisses him. \n\nThe author's actions: He's asking for support, which is reasonable, especially during such a major life event as childbirth. Not being asked about a significant decision that affects the shared home is a valid concern. The girlfriend's response is harsh and dismissive, which might indicate her own stress but doesn't justify her reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's advocating for his own needs, which is appropriate. He didn't do anything wrong by suggesting his mom. The girlfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The author's reaction seems reasonable given the lack of communication. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
