I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay for support. The author is upset that she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girlfriend didn't consult the author before arranging her mom's stay. That's a red flag because they share a home, so both should have a say. The author brings up the point about not being consulted, which is valid. Then he offers to invite his mom for support, which makes sense because both partners might need help during this time. But the girlfriend reacts negatively, saying he's an asshole and that he doesn't need support. Her response seems dismissive and maybe even a bit unfair because both parents might have valid reasons to help.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The author is trying to express his feelings and suggest a solution, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response is hostile and invalidating. So, the author's actions don't seem wrong. He's advocating for his needs and pointing out the lack of communication. The wrong here might be on the girlfriend's side for not involving him initially and reacting negatively. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
