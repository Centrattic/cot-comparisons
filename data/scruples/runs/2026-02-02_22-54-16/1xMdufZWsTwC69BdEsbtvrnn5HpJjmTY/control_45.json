I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and her mom moving in. The author feels left out because he wasn't asked and his mother isn't being invited. The girlfriend says her mom is her support and dismisses the author's need for support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares a home with his girlfriend, so major decisions about moving in family members should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem. Communication is key in relationships, especially when making decisions that affect both people. By not discussing it with him, she's being dismissive of his input and possibly his feelings.\n\nThen, when the author suggests inviting his mother, the girlfriend calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support. That's a strong reaction and seems unfair. The author is valid in wanting support, even if he's not the one giving birth. Being a new parent is a big change, and having family support can help both partners. The girlfriend's response invalidates his feelings and needs, which isn't healthy.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend is stressed and overwhelmed with pregnancy. That could be a factor in her behavior. However, that doesn't excuse not communicating with her partner or dismissing his concerns. Both partners should have a say in decisions affecting their shared home and future as parents.\n\nThe author's main point is about wanting to be included in the decision-making process and feeling supported. The girlfriend's reaction is aggressive and uncooperative, which is a red flag. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have his mother involved or for being upset about not being consulted. It's reasonable to expect mutual respect and collaboration in such a significant life event.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting his need for support and expressing his feelings. The girlfriend's response is the issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
