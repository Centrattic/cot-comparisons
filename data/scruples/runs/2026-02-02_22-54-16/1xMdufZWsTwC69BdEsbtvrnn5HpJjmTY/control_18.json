Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they wanted support from their own mother after their girlfriend's mom is coming to stay. The key points here are communication and mutual support.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom staying, which is a problem because they share a home. The author then points out that they didn't get asked, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, saying the author doesn't need support because they're not doing the labor. That seems unfair because being a supportive partner involves a lot of work, both emotional and physical. The author's reaction to invite their own mom is reasonable to balance the support.\n\nSo, the main issues are: lack of communication from the girlfriend, and her invalidating the author's need for support. The author isn't wrong for wanting support; in fact, it's healthy to have a support system. The girlfriend's reaction is more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
