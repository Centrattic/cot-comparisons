      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby comes. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about this. When he mentions it, she says her mom is her support, and he responds by suggesting his mom should come too, which leads to her calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author feels his input wasn't considered when a significant decision (having his mother-in-law stay) was made. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which might be a problem because they live together. It's a shared home, so major changes should ideally be discussed together. \n\nThen, the girlfriend's response seems dismissive and maybe a bit unfair. She calls him an asshole when he expresses his need for support. That's not a healthy way to handle disagreements. Also, her comment about him not needing support because he's not doing the \"real work\" might be minimizing his role and contributions. Pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding, but the partner's role in supporting the mother is crucial. The author might feel his needs are being ignored, especially if he's expecting help during this transition.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be under a lot of stress and anxiety about the upcoming birth. Her need for support from her own mother is valid, but she should have discussed this with her partner. The author's suggestion to invite his mother is about mutual support, which makes sense. However, his approach might have come off as confrontational, especially after she expressed her needs first. Maybe he could have approached it differently, but his desire for support isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe key issues are communication breakdown and mutual support expectations. The girlfriend didn't consult the author, and the author felt his needs were being dismissed. Both parties have valid points, but the girlfriend's reaction is more problematic because it's dismissive and potentially invalidating. The author is not wrong for wanting support; in fact, it's reasonable. The main problem is how both handled the communication aspect. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is likely B because he's not wrong for seeking support and expressing his feelings, even if his method could be improved.\n"
