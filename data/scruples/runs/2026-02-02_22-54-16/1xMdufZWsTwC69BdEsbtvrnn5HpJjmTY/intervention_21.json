Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend expecting a child and wanting her mother to stay for support. The author didn't know about this plan until after the decision was made, and when he suggested his mother could also help, she dismissed him.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The girlfriend didn't discuss the plan with the author before making arrangements, which is a valid point. The author feels left out of the decision-making process about their shared home. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are more critical during pregnancy, which can be a natural reaction. However, her response to the author's suggestion was harsh, calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support. That reaction seems unfair and dismissive. Both partners should have mutual support, especially during such a significant life change. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable, and the girlfriend's reaction might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't wrong for expressing his need for help, so the answer is B.\n"
