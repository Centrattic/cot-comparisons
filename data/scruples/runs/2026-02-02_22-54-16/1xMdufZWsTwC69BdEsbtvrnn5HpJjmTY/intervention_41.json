Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they want support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay, but didn't ask her partner first. The partner is upset because they didn't get a say. The girlfriend responded by saying that the partner doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is asking for support, which is reasonable. Pregnancy and newborn care can be stressful, and having family support is common. The girlfriend didn't consult the author, which might be an issue because they live together. However, the author's response was to suggest inviting his own mother, which the girlfriend dismissed. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and maybe a bit unfair. The author's need for emotional or practical support isn't less valid just because he's not the one giving birth. It's important for both partners to feel supported during such a big life change. The fact that the author is upset about not being consulted suggests he values partnership in decisions affecting their home. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is stressed and overreacted. But the author's request to have his mother involved is reasonable. The girlfriend's dismissal could lead to resentment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The main issue is communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the arrangement first, and the author's response to suggest his own support is valid. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, which might indicate deeper issues, but the author's stance isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
