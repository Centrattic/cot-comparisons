Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to come stay with them before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she called him an asshole and said he didn't need support because he wouldn't be doing the actual work of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process because the girlfriend made the arrangement without consulting him. That's a valid concern. When significant decisions affect both partners, especially in a shared home, communication is crucial. The girlfriend's response to the author's suggestion seems dismissive and possibly invalidating. She implies his needs aren't important, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is going through a major life change and might be stressed. Her need for support is understandable. However, how she handled the situation\u2014by not discussing it with her partner and then belittling him\u2014could be problematic. The author's request for his own support is reasonable. Just because he isn't the one giving birth doesn't mean he doesn't need help or have valid feelings about the situation. \n\nI should also think about cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, it's common for the expecting parent to have more immediate support, but the partner's emotional and practical needs shouldn't be ignored. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress, but that doesn't justify her being rude. The author's response\u2014asking for his mother's support\u2014was a reasonable way to express his need for help and possibly to balance the support system. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong. He's seeking support and felt excluded from a decision that affects their shared home. The girlfriend's dismissal is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
