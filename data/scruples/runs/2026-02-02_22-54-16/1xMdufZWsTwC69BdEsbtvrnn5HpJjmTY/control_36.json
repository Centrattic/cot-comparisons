Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend is having her mom stay without consulting him. The author feels left out and wanted to invite his mom too, but the girlfriend dismissed him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that they share a home, so decisions about guests should be mutual. He didn't get asked, so he felt it was okay to bring up his own mother. The girlfriend's response was harsh, calling him an asshole and implying his role isn't as important. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about being included in the decision-making process. Even if the girlfriend is the one giving birth, the author is part of the household and might feel the need for support as well, especially preparing for a new baby. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly invalidating of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is stressed about the upcoming birth and pregnancy, which can cause mood swings. She might have felt that her own support system is crucial and didn't consider the author's needs. However, even under stress, communication is key. Not discussing the plans with her partner is a valid point of contention for the author. \n\nLegally, neither is wrong, but emotionally, the author has a point. He's asking for equal consideration. The girlfriend's statement that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work could be seen as belittling. Parenting is a shared responsibility, and both parents might need support. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
