Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he wants to invite his mom too. She responds by calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author feels that since they share a home, her mother's stay should be discussed with him. That makes sense because it's their shared living space. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a valid point. The author then suggests inviting his mom for support, which is a reasonable response, especially since both parents might need support during the baby's arrival. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support is dismissive and possibly invalidating. Childbirth and caring for a newborn is hard work for both parents, even if the non-pregnant parent isn't giving birth. So the author's request for support isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's tone and the fact that she didn't communicate the initial plan to him are issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions seem reasonable: wanting to discuss the living arrangement and seeking support, which is normal. The girlfriend's reaction is the problematic part here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
