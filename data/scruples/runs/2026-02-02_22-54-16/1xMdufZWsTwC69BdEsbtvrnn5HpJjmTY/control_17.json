      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him about inviting her mom, even though he's part of the household. When the author suggests inviting his own mom for support, the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both partners live together, so major decisions affecting the home should ideally be mutual. The girlfriend didn't ask the author about her mom's visit, which might be an issue. The author feels his needs aren't being acknowledged, which is valid because cohabitation means shared responsibilities and decisions.\n\nThe girlfriend's response to the author's suggestion is harsh\u2014calling him an asshole. That's not a healthy way to handle differing opinions. The author is asserting his right to seek support, which is reasonable given the life-changing event of a new baby. It's common for both parents to have support systems during pregnancy and postpartum. The girlfriend's dismissal invalidates the author's feelings and contributions, which can lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, pregnancy and childbirth do place a significant physical and emotional burden on the pregnant partner. It's understandable that the girlfriend might prioritize her own support system. But communication is key. She should have discussed her plans with her partner to ensure mutual understanding and agreement. The author's reaction\u2014wanting to bring in his mom\u2014shows he's trying to be proactive and share the support, which is a positive step. The girlfriend's hostility, though, is damaging.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the issue isn't black and white. The author isn't wrong for wanting support; it's a normal expectation. The girlfriend isn't wrong for needing her mom's help, but her approach could be better. The main problem is the lack of communication and respect in their discussion. The author is justified in feeling his voice matters in shared decisions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
