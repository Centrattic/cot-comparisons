      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The user's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of months. He didn't like that she didn't ask him first because they share the home. When he brought it up, she dismissed his need for support, saying he wouldn't be doing any real work. He then suggested his mom should come too, and she called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a major life event, pregnancy, and it's common for people to seek support from family, especially from their parents. Her needing her mom's help is understandable. However, the issue here is that she didn't consult her partner about this arrangement. Shared living spaces mean both parties should have a say in who's staying there, especially for an extended period. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling left out of the decision. He's not just upset about the mother staying but about not being included in the conversation. That makes sense because it's their home. When she dismissed his need for support by saying he doesn't have real work, that's a problem. Pregnancy and childbirth are significant, but the partner also has a role, and his feelings are valid. He's right to want support, even if it's different from hers. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was harsh and dismissive. Calling him an asshole and invalidating his feelings isn't healthy communication. The author's request to have his mom stay isn't about overshadowing her needs but about seeking equal consideration. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a deeper issue here. The girlfriend might be stressed and overwhelmed, leading her to react poorly. But even under stress, communication is key. The author's main point is about being included in decisions affecting their home. That's a reasonable expectation. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's actions were flawed because she didn't discuss the arrangement first. The author's response was a way to highlight that he also needs support and that his voice matters. While his approach might not have been perfect, the core issue is about mutual respect and shared decision-making. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
