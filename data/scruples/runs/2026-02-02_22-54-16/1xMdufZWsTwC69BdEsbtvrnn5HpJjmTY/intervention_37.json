Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend is asking her mom to stay, but didn't consult the author. The author feels left out and suggests inviting his mom too, but the girlfriend reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (which I assume means childbirth).\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author is upset about not being asked and feels his needs for support are dismissed. The girlfriend might be stressed and focused on her own needs, maybe not realizing the author's perspective. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is expressing his feelings of being excluded when the girlfriend decided to have her mom over without discussing it with him. That's valid because it's their shared home, so input from both partners is important. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and judgmental, which isn't helpful. She's invalidating his need for support, which is a common but often overlooked aspect of pregnancy and postpartum for fathers or partners.\n\nSupport isn't just about the physical aspects of childbirth; it's also about the emotional and logistical challenges of caring for a newborn. The author's request for his mother's support is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction, calling him an asshole and minimizing his role, seems unfair. It's possible she's under a lot of stress, but that doesn't justify the hurtful response.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. He's asserting his needs in a situation where he feels ignored. The real issue might be the lack of communication and empathy from the girlfriend's side. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
