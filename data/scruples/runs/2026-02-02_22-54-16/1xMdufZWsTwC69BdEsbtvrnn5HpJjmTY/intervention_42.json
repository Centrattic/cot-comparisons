Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting support when the baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay, but she didn't ask her partner first. The partner then suggests his mom should come too, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: the author feels his opinion should be considered since they share the home. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying. Then when he suggests his mom, she dismisses him. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, in a relationship where both partners live together, major decisions affecting the household should be mutual. The girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom, which could be a problem. The author was just trying to assert that his needs for support matter too. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems unfair. She's implying that his support isn't necessary because he's not the one giving birth. But emotionally and practically, both partners might need support. The author is in a shared home, so his input should be considered. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs and the shared responsibility of living together. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and invalidates his feelings. So the answer should be B.\n"
