Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives.\n\nSo the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels his opinion wasn't considered when the girlfriend made the decision about her mom staying. Communication is a big part here. When making decisions that affect both partners, especially in a shared home, it's important to discuss and agree. The girlfriend didn't consult him before making the arrangement, which is a valid point. \n\nThen, when the author brings it up, the girlfriend dismisses his concerns and even belittles him, which is problematic. She's not acknowledging his need for support, which is reasonable. The author's request for his mother to be involved isn't unreasonable either, especially since they are both part of the household and future parents. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is hostile and invalidating. It's important in a relationship to support each other's needs, especially during stressful times like pregnancy and childbirth. The author's reaction is about wanting to be included in decisions and having his support needs recognized. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend is the one who didn't communicate and then dismissed his feelings. The author is asking for fair treatment and mutual support, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
