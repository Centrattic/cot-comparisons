      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. He wanted to invite his mom too, but she dismissed his need for support.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. That's a valid point because when a partner makes a significant change like having a family member move in, it's important to discuss it together. Communication is key in a relationship, especially when living together. The girlfriend's response that her mom is her support and that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the work seems dismissive. Pregnancy and childbirth are major life events, and the author is probably feeling that his support needs are being ignored. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be stressed and overwhelmed, which is why she focused on her own needs. She might not have considered the author's feelings about inviting his mother or the shared living situation. However, not involving him in the decision is a mistake. Partners should consult each other about such matters. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014wanting to invite his mom\u2014shows he wants mutual support, which makes sense. He's not wrong for needing support either; having a new baby is a big transition. The girlfriend's response was harsh and dismissive, which could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication and the girlfriend's dismissive attitude. The author is asserting his right to be involved in decisions affecting their home and to seek support, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
