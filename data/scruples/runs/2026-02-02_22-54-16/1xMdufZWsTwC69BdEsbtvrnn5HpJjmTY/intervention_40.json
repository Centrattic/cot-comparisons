Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The context is that the girlfriend (soon-to-be wife) wants her mom to stay for a couple of months, but she didn't include the author in the decision. When he asks, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests his mom should come too, and she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication and mutual respect. The author didn't have a say in the initial decision about his own home. That's a valid point. He's sharing the home, so both partners should have a say in who's staying there. The girlfriend's response is dismissive and disrespectful, which is a red flag. She's invalidating his need for support, which isn't fair. Support during pregnancy and postpartum is important for both parents, even if the physical labor isn't the same. Emotional and practical support from the author's side is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh. So the author isn't wrong for wanting support; he's advocating for his own needs. The key issue is the lack of communication and her dismissive attitude. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
