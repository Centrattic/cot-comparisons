I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about her mom staying in their shared home. When he brings it up, she dismisses his concern, saying her mom is her support, and implies he doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares the home, so the girlfriend making decisions without his input is a valid point. Communication is key in relationships, especially during big life changes like having a baby. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly invalidating. She's making a unilateral decision about their shared living space, which can be seen as disrespectful. The author's desire for his own support, like inviting his mom, is reasonable. It's natural for both partners to seek support during such a significant event. The girlfriend's reaction, calling him an asshole and belittling his need for support, indicates a lack of empathy and communication. \n\nThe author is not being unreasonable here. He's expressing his feelings about the shared space and his own need for support. The girlfriend's actions and response are problematic because they don't involve the author in decisions affecting their home and dismiss his emotional needs. So the author is justified in feeling upset. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
