I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The scenario is that the girlfriend, who's pregnant, wants her mom to move in for support, but she didn't consult her partner. The partner then asks why he can't invite his mom too, and the girlfriend responds negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upset that his partner didn't ask him about the mother staying. That's a valid concern because it's their shared home. Communication is crucial in relationships, especially during major life events like pregnancy. The girlfriend's response that her mom is her support might be true, but the author's need for support shouldn't be dismissed. The partner's reaction of calling him an asshole and denying his need for support is problematic. It shows a lack of empathy towards his potential needs, even if the reasoning is that he's not the one giving birth. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel supported. The author's request to involve his mother is reasonable. The girlfriend's dismissal might stem from stress or the physical demands of pregnancy, but that doesn't justify invalidating his feelings. The core issue here is about mutual consideration and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included in decisions affecting their shared home. The girlfriend's response is more indicative of the problem here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue is the lack of communication and the partner's dismissive reaction, not the author's desire for support.\n"
