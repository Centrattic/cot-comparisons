Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom should come too, she dismissed him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of a decision about their shared home. That's a valid concern because it's their home, so both partners should have a say. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy is problematic because both partners go through significant stress during a birth. The author's request for equal support from his mom is reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014suggests a lack of empathy. While it's true she's under a lot of stress, dismissing his needs entirely isn't fair. The author isn't being selfish; he's asking for the same kind of support she's expecting. The problem is more about her reaction than his request. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
