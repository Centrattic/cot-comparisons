Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby's arrival. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is that the decision wasn't made jointly. In a shared home, especially in a relationship, big decisions like having family stay should probably be discussed together. The girlfriend's response about support might be valid because pregnancy and postpartum can be tough, but the author's reaction is about wanting equal consideration for his support needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of childbirth is a bit problematic. That could be seen as minimizing the emotional and practical support the author might need. However, the author didn't initially address her feelings about needing her mom's support but instead mirrored the request for his own mom without understanding her perspective first. Maybe he should have listened more before countering. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point about shared responsibility in the home. Decisions affecting the household should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a breach of communication. The author's reaction might be a bit abrupt, but his desire to be included is reasonable. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asserting his right to be involved in decisions about their home. The girlfriend's response was dismissive and hurtful. The answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
