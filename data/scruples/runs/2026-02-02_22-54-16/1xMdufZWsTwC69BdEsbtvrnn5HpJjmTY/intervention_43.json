      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for several weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset that she didn't ask him first since they share the home. When he points this out, she dismisses him, saying her mom is her support, and even calls him an asshole when he suggests inviting his own mother for support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. His girlfriend didn't consult him before inviting her mother, which is a reasonable concern because it affects their living space. The author's response is to mention inviting his own mother, which seems like a valid reaction to seek equal support. However, the girlfriend's response is hostile, implying that the author doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, when a major life event like having a baby happens, both partners should ideally be on the same page. The girlfriend's unilateral decision to bring in her mother without discussing it with her partner is problematic. It shows a lack of consideration for the author's feelings and the shared living situation. The author's request to have his mother involved is a reasonable counterpoint, especially if he's expecting mutual support during such a significant transition.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as confrontational. Instead of pointing out the lack of consultation first, he immediately suggests inviting his own mother, which might have led to her defensive reaction. Maybe a more collaborative approach, like discussing the need for support from both sides, could have been better. But the core issue is the girlfriend's failure to include him in the decision, which is the main point of contention.\n\nIt's also important to consider the emotional state of the pregnant partner. Pregnancy can be stressful, and she might be prioritizing her own needs and support system. However, that doesn't negate the author's valid concern about the shared space and his right to be involved in decisions about it. The girlfriend's dismissive response, especially calling him an asshole, is unhelpful and disrespectful. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did bring up his concern, and the girlfriend's response was defensive rather than collaborative. The author isn't wrong in seeking support; it's a natural part of preparing for a new baby. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's unilateral decision and her dismissive attitude rather than the author's desire for support.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. He's expressing a valid need for consideration and support, and his girlfriend's response is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
