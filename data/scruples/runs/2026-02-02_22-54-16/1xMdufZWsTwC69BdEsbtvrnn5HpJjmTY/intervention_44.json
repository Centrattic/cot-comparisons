Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a few weeks, but didn't consult her partner. The author feels left out and wants support too, so he suggests inviting his mom. The girlfriend reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through pregnancy and childbirth, which is a big deal, and wanting her mom's support makes sense. But the author feels his needs are being ignored. Communication is key here. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, which is a big decision since they share a home. The author's request for his mom's support is valid too, as partners should support each other.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems dismissive and maybe a bit unfair. She's focusing on her role as the one giving birth, which is natural, but the author's emotional support is important too. Maybe she's stressed and projecting her stress onto him, which isn't helpful. The author is asking for equal consideration of his need for support, which isn't unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his needs, and the girlfriend's reaction is the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
