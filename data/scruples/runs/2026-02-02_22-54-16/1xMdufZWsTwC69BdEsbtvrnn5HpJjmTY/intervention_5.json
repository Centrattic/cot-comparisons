Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and then dismissed his suggestion to invite his mom by saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is about communication and shared decision-making. The author and his girlfriend are sharing a home, so major decisions like having someone move in should be mutual. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a problem because it's their shared living space. The author's frustration is valid because he wasn't included in the decision, which can lead to feelings of being disregarded.\n\nThen, when the author suggests his mom could come for support, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and rude. She implies his needs aren't valid, which is problematic. Support during pregnancy and postpartum is important for both partners, even if the father isn't giving birth. The author is likely feeling that his need for support, whether emotional or practical, is being ignored. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is dismissive and could be seen as undermining the author's role in the impending parenthood. It's possible she's stressed and her hormones are affecting her behavior, but that doesn't justify the way she spoke to him. \n\nThe author's request for his mom to stay isn't just about support; it's about feeling included in the process of becoming parents together. Not being asked about her mom's visit is a breach of partnership. The girlfriend's mom staying is a significant change, and the author's right to be part of that decision is valid.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the points above, the author's actions (expressing his feelings and asking to invite his mom) are reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior is the main issue here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
