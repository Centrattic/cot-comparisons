      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend (or maybe fianc\u00e9e?) didn't consult him when she asked her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author feels it's unfair since they share the home and was upset that his partner didn't include him in that decision. When he asked, she dismissed his concern by saying her mom was her support, and when he offered to invite his mom for support too, she called him an asshole and said he didn't need support because he wouldn't be doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication, shared responsibility, and mutual support in a relationship. The author is upset because he wasn't included in the decision to have his partner's mom stay, which affects their shared home. It's reasonable for him to want to discuss major life changes with his partner, especially when it involves family moving in. The girlfriend's response, dismissing his need for support and being disrespectful, seems problematic. She's implying that his role isn't significant enough to require support, which might be an invalidation of his contributions and feelings.\n\nIn relationships, especially when preparing for a baby, both partners should feel supported. The author's desire to involve his mother could be about seeking emotional support, help with logistics, or simply feeling included. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014shows a lack of empathy and poor communication. Even if the initial request was hers, the author has a valid point about shared living space and mutual decision-making.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or personal context here. In some cultures, the mother of the pregnant woman is the primary support during pregnancy. The author might feel left out, but the girlfriend might feel pressure from her own family. But the way she responded is still an issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to include his mother, especially since they share the home. The problem might stem from a lack of open communication rather than the author being in the wrong. So, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
