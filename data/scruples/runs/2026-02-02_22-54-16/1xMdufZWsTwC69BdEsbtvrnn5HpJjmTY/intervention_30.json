Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for about two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's part of the household. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support. The author then suggests inviting his own mom, but she dismisses it by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work (like childbirth). The author thinks he's not in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are communication, shared responsibility, and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their home. When he raises the issue, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and invalidating. She's focusing on her own needs but not considering his perspective or his right to have his support system involved. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning for a major life event like childbirth, both partners should ideally discuss and agree on such arrangements. The girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom staying, which could be seen as a lack of communication. The author's reaction is to propose his own support system, which is a reasonable response. The girlfriend's comment about him not needing support because he's not the one giving birth might be minimizing his role or the stress he might feel. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The girlfriend's actions and response seem to be the issue here. She didn't include her partner in the decision, and her dismissal of his need for support is problematic. The author is advocating for himself by suggesting his mom's visit, which is a valid way to seek support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
