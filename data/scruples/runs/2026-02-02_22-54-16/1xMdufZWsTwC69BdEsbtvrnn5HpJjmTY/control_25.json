Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and wanting her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first. When he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" of pregnancy.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend didn't ask the author before making arrangements for her mom to stay. That's a red flag because they share a home. The author feels left out of the decision-making process, which is valid. He's entitled to input when it affects their shared living space.\n\nThen, the girlfriend's response to the author's suggestion is pretty dismissive. She calls him an asshole and invalidates his need for support. That's not healthy. Support during pregnancy and postpartum isn't just for the mother; partners also need support. The girlfriend's attitude seems to downplay the author's role and stress. \n\nSo, the author is justified in feeling upset. He's asking for mutual support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is what's problematic here. She's being dismissive and not considering his feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies with the girlfriend's behavior and lack of communication.\n"
