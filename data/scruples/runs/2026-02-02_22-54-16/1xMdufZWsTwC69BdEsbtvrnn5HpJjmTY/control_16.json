Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mom to stay for several weeks, but didn't consult her partner first. The partner feels left out and suggests his mom should also come, but she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The girlfriend didn't talk to the author about her mom staying, which is a big decision affecting their shared home. That's a red flag. She might have thought she was doing the right thing, but not including her partner in such a major life change is a mistake. \n\nThen, when the author brings it up and suggests his mom should come too, her response is harsh. Calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support is not healthy. Even if the author's suggestion was impulsive, her reaction is overly harsh and invalidates his feelings. Support is important for both partners during a pregnancy, even if the roles are different. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable, especially in a shared living situation.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's actions\u2014making a major decision without discussion and reacting negatively to the partner's input\u2014show a lack of respect and communication. The author isn't entirely blameless because suggesting his mom without considering the situation's timing might not be ideal, but the main issue is the girlfriend's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
