Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author didn't know about this arrangement until the girlfriend's mom was already coming over. The girlfriend didn't consult him, and when he pointed that out, she dismissed his concerns, saying her mom is her support and that the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the actual work of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a committed relationship, sharing a home, so major decisions like having family stay should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't include him in the decision-making, which is a red flag. Communication is key in relationships, especially during significant life events like having a baby. By not discussing this with him, she's not respecting his input or their shared responsibility as a couple.\n\nThen, when the author asks about his mother coming over for support, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and even confrontational. She calls him an asshole and invalidates his need for support. That's a problem because both partners should feel supported during such a transition. The girlfriend's attitude is not just about support for her; it's about dismissing his feelings and needs, which is unfair.\n\nThe author is advocating for his own needs here, which is perfectly reasonable. Support systems are important for everyone, especially during the stress of a new baby. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own stress or the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy, but that doesn't justify her dismissive behavior. The author is in the right for expressing his feelings and wanting to have his own support system in place.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the girlfriend was overwhelmed and didn't realize she should include him. But even in that case, the way she responded is not acceptable. The key issue is the lack of communication and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be involved in decisions that affect their shared home and his right to support. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
