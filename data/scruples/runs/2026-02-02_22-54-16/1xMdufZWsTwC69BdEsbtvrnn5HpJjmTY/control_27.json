      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she called him an asshole and dismissed his need for support.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the key points. The author is asking for support as the baby arrives, which is a significant life change. The girlfriend, however, is focusing on her own support system and didn't consult the author about his mother's involvement. That might be an issue because it's their shared home, so both partners should ideally have a say in who comes to live with them. The girlfriend's response to the author's suggestion is harsh, which could indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural norms and expectations. In many relationships, especially when having a child, both partners' families might be involved. The author might feel that his input is being ignored because his girlfriend didn't discuss her mother's stay with him. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author isn't taking her needs seriously, especially since she's the one going through pregnancy and childbirth. Her comment that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" could be a point of contention. It might come off as dismissive of his role in parenting and the support he might need as well.\n\nI should also consider communication styles. The girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mother's stay, which could be seen as a failure to include him in a decision affecting their shared home. The author's reaction in suggesting his mother might also come could be a valid attempt to balance things, but her response was hostile. That's a problem because it shuts down dialogue and makes the author feel invalidated.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of support. Pregnancy and early parenthood are stressful, and both partners need support. The girlfriend's need for her mother's help is understandable, but the author's need for support shouldn't be dismissed. The fact that she called him an asshole is a negative communication tactic and could harm the relationship. The author's desire to involve his mother might be a reasonable way to feel supported, especially if the girlfriend's mother's presence is making him feel excluded.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the girlfriend's right to her own support system. She might genuinely feel that her mother is essential for her well-being during this time. The key issue is the lack of mutual discussion. Both partners should have had a conversation about support systems and how to integrate both families into their home. The girlfriend's reaction to the author's suggestion was unkind and dismissive, which is where she might be in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for wanting support; it's a normal expectation in such a major life change.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting support. The main issue is the lack of communication and the girlfriend's harsh response. Both parties should have discussed the situation together to find a solution that respects both their needs. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's need for support and her condescending remark are problematic. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
