I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she wanted her mom to stay, but didn't consult him. The author then wants to invite his mom too, but she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't ask the author about her mom staying. That's a key point. In a shared home, major decisions should involve both partners. So maybe she's in the wrong for not discussing it first. Then, the author's response is to suggest his mom as support. The girlfriend calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support. That's a problem. She's being dismissive and making a judgment about his role.\n\nThe author is seeking support, which is reasonable. Becoming a parent is stressful, and expecting the other partner to handle all the support isn't fair. The girlfriend's reaction is hostile and undermines the author's needs. The author's request is valid because both partners should have support systems. The girlfriend's response seems to devalue his role, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more on the girlfriend's side for not consulting him and dismissing his needs. The answer should be B.\n"
