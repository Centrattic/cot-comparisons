Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the scenario is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom come too, she dismisses him. The author is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might be feeling overwhelmed and seeking support from her mother, which is a common thing during pregnancy. She might have thought it's her decision because she's the one carrying the baby. But the author is sharing the home, so it's reasonable for him to feel involved in such a significant decision. The fact that she didn't consult him first could be a problem in communication.\n\nThe author's response was to suggest his own mother, which seems like a valid request. However, the girlfriend's reaction was harsh, calling him an asshole. That's a negative response, but the author was asserting his need for support. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for wanting support, but maybe he could have approached it differently. However, the girlfriend's dismissive attitude and not involving him initially might be the bigger issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's asking for support in a shared living situation. The girlfriend's lack of communication and the harsh response might make her more to blame. The author's action was a reasonable reaction to her not including him. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
