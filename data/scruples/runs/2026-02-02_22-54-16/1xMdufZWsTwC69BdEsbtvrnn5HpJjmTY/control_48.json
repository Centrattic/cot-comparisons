Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for several weeks. The author feels upset because she didn't consult him first, and when he suggests his mom might also need to be invited for support, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (childbirth). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants support, which is reasonable. Pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful, and having family support is common. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are more pressing right now, especially since she's the one giving birth. But the key issue here is communication. The girlfriend didn't discuss the plan with the author before making arrangements, which is a problem. Shared living arrangements mean both partners should be consulted on major decisions affecting the home.\n\nWhen the author suggests his mother might also need to stay, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and disrespectful. She invalidates his need for support, which is unfair. Both parents (biological and otherwise) can have support needs during this time. The fact that she called him an asshole is a clear sign of disrespect. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The main issues are the lack of communication from the girlfriend and her disrespectful response. The author is justified in feeling upset about not being included in the decision and being dismissed when he expresses his needs. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
