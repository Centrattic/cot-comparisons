I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay, but not consulting him, which he finds upsetting. When he brings it up, she dismisses his need for support, implying only she needs help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship and shares a home. The girlfriend's decision to have her mother stay without his input could be seen as disregarding his feelings or the shared living space. Communication is key in relationships, so not discussing this with him might be a problem. \n\nThe author's response is to suggest his own mother should come for support. His girlfriend's reaction is harsh\u2014calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support. This seems unfair, as both partners might need emotional and practical help during such a significant life event. The girlfriend's statement that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" is problematic. It undermines the emotional labor and support he might need, which is a valid point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's actions and words seem more at fault here. The author is expressing a reasonable desire for support, which is not inherently wrong. However, the situation's complexity involves communication issues. The author could have approached the conversation differently, perhaps focusing more on his feelings about not being included in the decision rather than immediately suggesting his own mother. Still, the core issue is the girlfriend's lack of consideration and her dismissive attitude. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support. Both partners should feel supported, and the girlfriend's response invalidates the author's needs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
