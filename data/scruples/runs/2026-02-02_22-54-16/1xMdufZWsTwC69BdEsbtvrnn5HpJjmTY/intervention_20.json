Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for support, but she didn't ask her partner first. The partner is upset because they share the home and feels left out. The girlfriend then dismisses the partner's suggestion to invite his mom by saying he doesn't need support because he isn't doing the real work.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if the author (the partner) is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the partner didn't consult him about his mom staying. That seems like a big decision since they share the home. If someone moves in with you, especially for an extended period, it's reasonable to discuss it together. So not consulting him is a problem. The partner's reaction is to ask why his mom can't come, which is a valid point because both parents are having a child, so both might need support. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, which could be hurtful. She's implying that his role isn't as important, which is unfair. The partner is seeking support too, which is reasonable. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or personal context I'm missing? Maybe in some situations, the mother's role is expected to be more involved. However, in a shared home, both partners should have a say in who moves in. Also, the partner isn't in the wrong for wanting to have his own support system. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole is unkind and invalidates his feelings. The core issue is communication and mutual respect. \n\nSo, based on that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions and words seem more in the wrong here. The author is asserting his right to have support and is upset about being excluded from the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
