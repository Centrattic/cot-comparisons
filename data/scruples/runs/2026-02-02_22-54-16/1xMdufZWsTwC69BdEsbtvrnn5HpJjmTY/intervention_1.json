I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he asks about it, she says her mom is her support. Then he suggests inviting his mom too, and she gets angry, calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he won't be doing the \"real work\" (like giving birth). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication, shared living space, and the division of support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process about having his mother over, which is understandable since they live together. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, but when he suggests his own mom, she dismisses him. Her response seems dismissive and possibly invalidating, implying his role isn't as important since he's not the one giving birth. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have a say in decisions affecting their shared home. The author's request for support is valid, especially during such a significant life event. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as not respecting his feelings or needs. However, maybe she was stressed or overwhelmed, which is common during pregnancy. But her response was harsh and didn't acknowledge his need for support.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by wanting his mom's support. It's a natural extension of the initial request. The girlfriend's response seems to undermine his contributions or needs. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication and mutual respect in their decision-making. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
