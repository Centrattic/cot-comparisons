I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who's pregnant, asked her mom to move in without consulting him. He felt it was his home too and was upset she didn't ask him first. When he suggested his mom should come too, she called him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the \"real work\" (the pregnancy and childbirth). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is the girlfriend's decision to bring her mom in without discussing it with the author. The author feels it's their shared home, so her not consulting him is a problem. Then, when he suggests his mom could help, she dismisses his need for support, which he sees as unfair.\n\nSo, who's right? Well, in a relationship, communication is key, especially big decisions like having a family member move in. The girlfriend didn't ask the author, which is a valid point. The author's reaction is to suggest his mom as well, maybe to show that he also needs support, which makes sense. However, the girlfriend's response is harsh and dismissive. She's implying that only she needs support because of the pregnancy. But the author might be feeling that the entire situation is a shared responsibility, and having support from both sides is important.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude here seems problematic. By calling him an asshole and belittling his role, she's not fostering teamwork. Even though she's going through the physical demands of pregnancy, the author might be feeling overwhelmed or underappreciated. The fact that she didn't discuss the living arrangements first is a red flag. The author's request for his mom's support is reasonable, especially if he's also contributing to the caregiving or feels he might need help. \n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend's perspective is that she's the one carrying the child and facing the immediate challenges, so she feels her support is more critical. However, that doesn't negate the author's need for support. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend's reaction is not helpful, and the author is justified in feeling that his input should be considered. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's seeking support and expressing a need, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's actions and words are the ones that are more questionable here. He's not being dismissive of her needs; he's just asking for his own. The fact that she didn't consult him about her mom's stay is a bigger issue than his suggestion to have his mom stay. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting support, and the girlfriend's response is the problem.\n"
