I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks, but she didn't ask her partner first. The boyfriend is upset about not being consulted because they share the home. When he mentions that, she says her mom is her support, and then he suggests his mom could also come. She gets angry and says he doesn't need support.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and mutual support. The author feels wronged because he wasn't included in the decision about having his mother-in-law stay. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive, which is probably why he's upset. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, major decisions about guests, especially for extended periods, should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't consult him first, which is a problem. But when he tried to bring up his own support needs, she shut him down, which is also an issue. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. He wanted to include his own support system, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh and dismissive, which could indicate she's not considering his feelings. However, the initial problem was her not including him in the first place. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is being excluded from a decision affecting their shared home. Her response to his concern was unkind. Neither is completely right, but the author's request for support isn't wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is the bigger problem here. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
