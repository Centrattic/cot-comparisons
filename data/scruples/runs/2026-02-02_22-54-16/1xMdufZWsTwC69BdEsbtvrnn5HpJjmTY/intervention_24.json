Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay, but the author feels left out because she didn't consult him and he was dismissed when he asked to invite his mom too.\n\nSo, first, the author is upset because the girlfriend didn't include him in the decision about her mom staying. Communication is key in relationships, so not discussing such a significant change in the home dynamic could be a point in the author's favor. He might feel that since they share a home, both partners should have a say in who's coming over for an extended period.\n\nThen, when the author suggests his mom should come for support, the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor part of childbirth. That seems pretty harsh and dismissive. The author is valid in wanting emotional or practical support, even if it's not the same as the physical demands of childbirth. Everyone can benefit from support during such a big life change.\n\nThe girlfriend's response makes it sound like she's not considering the author's needs or feelings, which could lead to resentment. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to have his mother stay. He's just mirroring the support that his partner is receiving. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend is under a lot of stress from pregnancy, which could explain her reaction. But even in stress, communication and mutual support are important. The author's main issue is about being excluded from the decision and not being validated in his need for support. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
