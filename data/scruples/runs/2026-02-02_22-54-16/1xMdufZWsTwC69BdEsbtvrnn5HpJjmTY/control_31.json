      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives but being upset that his girlfriend asked her mom to stay without consulting him. When he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (presumably the childbirth). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's argument is that since they share the home, the girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him. He feels his input is important. The girlfriend's response implies that her support is necessary during pregnancy and childbirth, which is a valid point. However, the author's request for his own support is also reasonable. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here? In many societies, pregnancy and postpartum support for the mother is traditional, but partners often feel left out or undervalued. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's need for support might be seen as invalidating his role and contributions. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem in a shared living situation. However, the author's response was to suggest his mom come too, which the girlfriend rejected. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole is harsh, but maybe she felt her needs were more urgent. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether not consulting him was a major oversight. Since they live together, major decisions like having someone stay should be mutual. The author is justified in feeling upset about being excluded. However, his response to suggest his mom might have been abrupt. But the girlfriend's dismissal of his support needs could also be inconsiderate. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to be involved in that decision. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
