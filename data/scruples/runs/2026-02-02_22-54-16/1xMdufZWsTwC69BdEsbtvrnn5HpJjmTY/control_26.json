I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first. Then, when he suggests inviting his own mom for support, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he won't be doing the \"real work\" of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels he should have been included in the decision to have her mom stay, which makes sense because they share the home. Communication is key in relationships, so not consulting the partner might be a valid point. The girlfriend's response, however, is defensive and dismissive. She calls him an asshole and minimizes his role, which could be seen as invalidating his feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are: the author wants support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay, which is a problem. Her response is hostile and undermines his need for support. \n\nThe author's request to involve his mom isn't about being equal but about feeling supported. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. She's not respecting his needs and is assuming he doesn't need support. In a partnership, both partners' needs should be considered. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting support. The problem is more on the girlfriend's side for not communicating and being dismissive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
