      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he mentions wanting his mom to come too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's request for her mother's support. It's common for pregnant women to seek help from family, especially as childbirth is a big event. The author is upset because he wasn't consulted. That makes sense because they share the home, so it's a joint living space. Not consulting him might be a valid point\u2014the author has a right to be involved in decisions about their home.\n\nThen, the author's response: he wants his mother to come too. The girlfriend's reaction is to call him an asshole and say he doesn't need support. That seems dismissive and unfair. Pregnancy and childbirth do affect the entire family, and the author's feelings of needing support might be valid. The girlfriend's comment about him not doing \"real work\" is a bit harsh and possibly invalidating. Pregnancy is a shared experience, and the partner's role in supporting the pregnant partner is important. If the girlfriend is not acknowledging his role and emotional needs, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's support system is important, but the author's need for support shouldn't be dismissed just because he's the non-pregnant partner. Men can experience anxiety, stress, and have their own needs during this time. The girlfriend's reaction may have been a knee-jerk response, but it's not a healthy way to handle the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is under a lot of stress from pregnancy and her hormones are causing her to react more strongly. It's possible she didn't mean to be hurtful but was overwhelmed. However, even if she's stressed, the way she responded is still hurtful and dismissive. Communication is key in such situations.\n\nThe core issue here is about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The author is justified in feeling upset that his partner didn't include him in the decision. His request to have his mother come is a reasonable response to ensure both sides have support. The girlfriend's reaction, however, is where the problem lies. Dismissing his need for support undermines his feelings and doesn't foster a collaborative approach to parenting.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's response, not the author's request. The author is asserting his need for support, which is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
