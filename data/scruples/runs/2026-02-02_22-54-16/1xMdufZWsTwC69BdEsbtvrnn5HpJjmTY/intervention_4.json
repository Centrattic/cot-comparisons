I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author (the boyfriend) is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key points are: the girlfriend didn't consult the author about her mom staying, which he feels is a problem because they share the home. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he counters by suggesting his mom should come too. She then accuses him of being an asshole, implying he doesn't need support because he's not the one birthing the baby.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing his feelings about not being included in the decision. It's reasonable for him to expect to be part of the conversation, especially since it's their shared home. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly invalidating. She's not acknowledging his need for support, which is fair because supporting a partner through pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful too. However, the author's request to have his mom stay might be about wanting equal consideration for his needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014is inappropriate. Her argument that he doesn't need support because he's not giving birth is flawed; emotional and practical support is valuable for both partners. The author is advocating for his own needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship. He's not being unreasonable by wanting to involve his mother for support, especially if the home is shared. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The girlfriend not consulting him first is a red flag, and her dismissive response exacerbates the issue. The author's reaction is a valid expression of his feelings, not an act of being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
