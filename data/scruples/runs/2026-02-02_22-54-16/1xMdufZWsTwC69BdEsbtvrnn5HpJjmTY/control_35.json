I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them during the baby's arrival, but not discussing it with the author first.\n\nSo, the author is upset because his girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying. He feels it's their home and they should both agree on such a big decision. When he points this out, she dismisses his concern by saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (which I assume refers to the physical labor of childbirth). The author then suggests inviting his own mom, but she calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both partners are in a shared home, so major decisions about living arrangements should be mutual. The girlfriend didn't include the author in the decision-making process, which is a valid point. She's probably stressed and relying on her mom's support, but that doesn't mean her partner's feelings are invalid. The author is asking for equal consideration and support, which is reasonable. It's a new situation for both, and having family support is common. However, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and disrespectful, which might indicate an issue on her part.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a right to be involved in the decision about who stays in their home? Yes. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh and possibly unfair. The author's request for his mom to come is about parity and support. It's normal for both parents to get support. The girlfriend's comment that he doesn't need support because of gender roles is outdated and invalid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking support and wanting to be part of the decision. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
