      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main point is that they should have been consulted about having her mom stay in their shared home. The girlfriend's argument is that she's the one carrying the baby and dealing with the physical aspects, so her support needs are different. The author feels left out and not considered, which is valid. They might feel like their contribution to the coming support is being dismissed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the upcoming months are going to be stressful and she needs her own support system. It's common for pregnant individuals to rely on family, especially from their side. But the author's request to have his mom come is about wanting to show support and share the burden, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support is harsh and could be seen as invalidating his feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did bring up a valid point about shared living space and wanting to support her by having his mother help. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like discussing it more collaboratively. But the main issue is that the girlfriend's response was hostile and dismissive. The author's request for support isn't unreasonable. In relationships, both partners should feel their needs are considered. The girlfriend's reaction seems more extreme, so the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
