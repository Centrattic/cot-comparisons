I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend who wants her mom to stay with them, but didn't consult her partner. The partner feels left out and suggests inviting his own mom, but she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and probably dealing with a lot of stress, so seeking support from her mom makes sense. However, not discussing this with her partner is a problem because they share the home. The partner's reaction is about feeling excluded and wanting equal support. His response was to suggest his mom, which the girlfriend rejected, saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nSo, is the author (the partner) in the wrong? Well, he's upset that his input wasn't considered. It's valid to feel that major decisions affecting the household should involve both partners. But maybe he could have approached it differently. Instead of just suggesting his mom, he might have expressed his feelings more clearly. However, her dismissing him entirely is also problematic. She's implying his needs are less valid, which isn't fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's the one undergoing pregnancy and childbirth, which is a lot. Her need for support is real, but not involving her partner in the decision is a mistake. The partner's desire for support shouldn't be dismissed. The key issue is communication and mutual consideration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend is at fault for not including her partner in the decision. The partner's request for support is reasonable, especially if he's going to be part of the caregiving. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
