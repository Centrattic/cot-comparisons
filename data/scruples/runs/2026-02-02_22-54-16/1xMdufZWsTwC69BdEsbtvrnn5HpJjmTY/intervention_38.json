      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for support. The author is upset that she didn't consult him first and then got defensive when he suggested his mom could also come. The girlfriend called him an asshole for implying he needed support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple shares a home, so any major decision about having someone live there should involve both partners. The author feels left out of the decision-making process, which is valid. Communication is key in relationships, especially when it comes to shared living arrangements. If the girlfriend made the decision without discussing it with her partner, that's a problem because it's their home. \n\nThen there's the part where the author suggests his mom could come too. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the labor is a bit dismissive. Pregnancy and childbirth are physically demanding, and while the author isn't carrying the baby, being a supportive partner can be stressful too. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own stress, but dismissing his need for support isn't helpful. \n\nHowever, the author should also consider her perspective. She might be overwhelmed and seeking emotional support from her mom, which is a common and understandable reaction. But that doesn't mean she shouldn't have included her partner in the decision. Both partners have a right to feel heard and involved in such significant changes to their living situation.\n\nThe author's reaction of suggesting his mom's support is a reasonable response to her not consulting him. It shows he wants to be involved and that he feels his needs are also important. The girlfriend's defensive and derogatory response is problematic because it invalidates his feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while both partners might have valid points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to be part of the decision and for feeling the need for his own support. The main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend's side. The answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
