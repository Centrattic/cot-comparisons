      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he responds by saying he should invite his mom too. She then calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (probably giving birth). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that she's the one going through the physical and emotional stress of pregnancy and childbirth, so she needs her mother's support. That makes sense. But the author is also part of the household and should have a say in who's coming to stay in their home. It's fair for him to want to be involved in decisions that affect both of them. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. She dismissed his point and made a derogatory comment. That's not constructive. Even if the author's request for his mom to come over might add to the household dynamics, he's still entitled to express his need for support. Maybe he's worried about the workload, emotional support, or just wants his own family involved. It's not just about being selfish; he's also part of the parenting team now.\n\nHowever, the author might have a point in feeling left out of the decision-making process. When someone is moving into their home, especially for an extended period, communication is key. The girlfriend could have discussed it with him first. On the other hand, the author could have approached the conversation more calmly. Telling her he's going to invite his mom as well might have been a reaction to her dismissal, but it could also be seen as trying to mirror her actions instead of addressing the underlying issue of support.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment about him not needing support because he's not giving birth is a bit dismissive. While biologically true, the transition to parenthood is a shared experience, and emotional support for both parents is important. The author's need for support shouldn't be invalidated just because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his needs and wants to be included in a decision that affects both of them. His reaction, while maybe a bit confrontational, is a response to her dismissiveness. The girlfriend's reaction was unkind and didn't acknowledge his perspective. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
