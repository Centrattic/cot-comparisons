Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. So, the scenario is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the birth. The author (the guy) is upset she didn't consult him first. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and he responds by suggesting his mom should come too. She then calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be about communication and mutual support in a relationship. The author is upset because the decision to have his girlfriend's mom stay was made without his input. That's a valid concern because it's their shared home, and major decisions like having someone live there should be discussed together. So the girl didn't include him in the decision-making process, which is a problem.\n\nThen, when he suggests his mom could come too, she dismisses his need for support. This seems dismissive and disrespectful. The author is probably feeling that his support needs are being ignored. He might feel that both partners need support, especially during a significant life event like childbirth. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole is a strong response and could indicate that she's not handling the situation well emotionally.\n\nSo, looking at both sides: The girlfriend's initial mistake was not discussing the living arrangement with him. The author's response was to propose a reciprocal action, which might be a way to show that both partners need support. However, suggesting his mom as a counter could be seen as a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. But considering the context, it's a reasonable way to highlight the fairness of the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did bring up the issue after the fact, which is good, but maybe he could have approached it differently. However, his main point is about wanting support, which is valid. The girlfriend's response was harsh and dismissive, which points to her being in the wrong. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication and the girlfriend's dismissive attitude.\n"
