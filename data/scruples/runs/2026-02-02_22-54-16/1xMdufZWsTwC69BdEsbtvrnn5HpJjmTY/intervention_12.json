I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him about her mom staying, even though they share the home. When he suggests his mom should come for support too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one doing the hard work of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel involved in decisions about their shared home. Not consulting him about a family member moving in could be seen as dismissive of his role, especially since cohabitation often requires mutual agreement on such matters. The girlfriend's justification that her mom is her support is valid, as pregnancy and childbirth are physically and emotionally taxing. However, her response to the author's suggestion\u2014calling him an asshole and implying he doesn't need support\u2014seems harsh and invalidating. Support isn't just about physical labor; emotional support is crucial for both partners during such times.\n\nThe author's reaction is reasonable. He's not asking for special treatment but equal consideration. The girlfriend's reaction undermines his need for support, which could affect their teamwork as parents. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for wanting support; the problem is more about how the girlfriend handled the situation. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
