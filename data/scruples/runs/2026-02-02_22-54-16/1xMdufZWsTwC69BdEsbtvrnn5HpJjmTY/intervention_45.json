Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author (the guy) is upset because she didn't consult him first. He points out that they share the home, so her bringing her mom in without discussing it feels like she's making a decision without considering his input. When he brings it up, she dismisses his need for support by saying he doesn't have to do the work, implying he doesn't need help. The author then suggests inviting his own mom for support, but she calls him an asshole.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, sharing a home means both partners should have a say in who moves in. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem. The author is right to feel that his input was needed. Then, when he brings it up, her response is dismissive and rude. She's invalidating his feelings and needs. The author's response\u2014suggesting his mom could also come\u2014seems reasonable. It's about mutual support. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is problematic. She's being defensive and not considering his perspective. The author is asserting his right to have his needs met, which is valid. So, in this scenario, the author isn't wrong. He's standing up for himself in a situation where his partner didn't include him in a major decision and then dismissed his concerns. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
