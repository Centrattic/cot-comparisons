Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support before and after the baby's arrival. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first. When he suggests his mom might also need to come for support, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants support and feels his opinion matters since they share the home. The girlfriend, pregnant, is asking for her mom's help, which is understandable. But not consulting him about a family member staying in their home could be a problem. The author's reaction is to propose his mom coming, which the girlfriend took as an insult.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay, which is a big deal. The author's right to have a say in who lives in their home is valid. His response, while maybe a bit confrontational, is a reaction to being excluded. However, the way he brought up his mom might have been the wrong approach. He could have expressed his feelings about not being consulted first before suggesting his own support. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's dismissal that he doesn't need support is dismissive of his emotional needs. Both parties might have handled the situation better. But the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision, which affects their shared home, the author isn't entirely at fault. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
