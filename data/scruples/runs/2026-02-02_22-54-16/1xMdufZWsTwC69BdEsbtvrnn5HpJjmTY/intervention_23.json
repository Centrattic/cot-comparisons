      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset that she didn't ask him first and suggests inviting his mom too. The girlfriend calls him an asshole for needing support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable. They share a home, so involving the author in decisions about having someone stay over makes sense. The girlfriend's response that the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" is problematic. Pregnancy and childbirth are physically and emotionally demanding, but the author's need for support in other ways (like help with the baby, household tasks, or emotional support) is valid. Everyone, regardless of gender, can benefit from support during such a significant life event.\n\nThe girlfriend's dismissal of the author's request shows a lack of consideration for his perspective. The author is trying to address the imbalance by suggesting his own support system, which is a fair approach. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from stress or her own needs, but it's not a valid reason to invalidate the author's feelings. The key issue here is about mutual respect and communication. The author isn't at fault for seeking support; it's a shared experience, and both partners should have their needs acknowledged. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
