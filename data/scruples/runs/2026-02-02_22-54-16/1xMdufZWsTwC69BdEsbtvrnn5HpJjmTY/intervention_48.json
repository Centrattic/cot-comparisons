I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend's mother is coming to stay, and the author feels left out because he wasn't consulted and his offer to have his own mother stay was rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares a home with his girlfriend, so any significant change like having a parent stay should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem. Communication is key in relationships, and making a decision that affects both people without discussion can lead to resentment.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author \"doesn't need any real work\" is dismissive. Childbirth and early parenthood are stressful for both parents, and expecting the mother to handle all the emotional labor without support isn't fair. The author is asserting his right to have support as well, which is reasonable. It's important that both partners feel supported during such a major life event.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the author's reaction was proportionate. He did bring up the issue, which is a good step. The girlfriend's mother staying for a month is a big change, and the author's feeling of being excluded is valid. The girlfriend's response was harsh, which might indicate a deeper issue in their communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The girlfriend should have discussed the move with her partner. The author, by suggesting his mother stay, is trying to assert his need for support, which he's entitled to. The problem here is the lack of communication and mutual support. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting support; it's a normal expectation. The girlfriend's dismissive attitude is problematic, but the main issue is the lack of collaboration in decision-making.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because he's seeking support and the girlfriend didn't involve him in the decision. Both need to communicate better, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
