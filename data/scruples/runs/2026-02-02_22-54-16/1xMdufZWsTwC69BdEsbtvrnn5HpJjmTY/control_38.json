      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before the baby comes and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first about her mom staying, and when he suggests his mom should come too for support, she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work\" (probably referring to childbirth).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is under a lot of stress from pregnancy and may be prioritizing her own needs. She might feel that her mother's support is crucial for her well-being during this time. However, the author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. It's reasonable for him to want to be involved in such a significant decision, especially since it affects their living space.\n\nThe author's request to invite his own mother could be about wanting to provide support as well, not just for himself but to help his girlfriend. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not giving birth might be dismissive and could make the author feel undervalued. Her comment that he's an asshole for suggesting his mother could be seen as invalidating his feelings and contributions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The girlfriend has a valid need for support during pregnancy and childbirth, which is a major life event. However, the author has a right to be consulted about who stays in their home. The girlfriend's reaction seems harsh and dismissive, which might indicate poor communication. The author's desire to include his mother could also be a way to show partnership, but he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first, considering her initial lack of consultation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He might not be entirely at fault because he was reacting to being left out. However, his approach of suggesting his mother without prior discussion could be seen as a bit abrupt. The main issue here is communication. Both partners need to talk about their needs and feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was likely the bigger problem because she dismissed his feelings and didn't involve him in the initial decision. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to improve communication.\n"
