Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for a few weeks, but she didn't ask her partner. The partner then suggests his mom should also come for support, but the girlfriend gets upset, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue seems to be about the girlfriend not including the author in the decision to have her mother stay. The author feels left out of the discussion about their shared home. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, implying that the author's needs aren't valid. \n\nSo, the author is upset because he wasn't consulted about his mom coming over. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a problem because it's their shared home. Then the author brings up his own support needs, but she invalidates his feelings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's actions of not consulting her partner about a significant change in their home is a red flag. Shared living spaces require mutual agreement. The author's reaction of wanting his own support is reasonable, especially since parenting is a joint responsibility. The girlfriend's dismissal is problematic because it's dismissive and doesn't acknowledge his role in the upcoming responsibilities.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's seeking support and is reacting to being excluded from a decision. The girlfriend's response is the issue, not the author's request. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
