I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a couple of weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, since they share the home. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support, and then he suggests his mom should come too. She gets angry and says he's an asshole because he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home, which is a valid concern. When a couple is expecting a child, it's important that both partners feel their needs are considered. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly hurtful, as she's not acknowledging the author's need for support. However, the author did respond in kind by suggesting his mom should come as well, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't ask first either. He just assumed he could invite his mom after she already had plans. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first instead of making a counteroffer. But then again, he's upset because she didn't include him in the initial decision. The girlfriend's comment about him not needing support is definitely problematic and could be seen as belittling. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault because he's expressing his need for support, which is reasonable. However, his approach of suggesting his mom without prior discussion might not have been the best way to communicate. The main issue here seems to be the lack of communication rather than the author being in the wrong. His girlfriend's response was harsh and invalidating, which is a bigger problem. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting support, but maybe his method of addressing it could be improved. But the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
