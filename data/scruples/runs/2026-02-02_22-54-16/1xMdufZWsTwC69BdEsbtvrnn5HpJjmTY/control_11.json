Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple expecting a baby, and the girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first about her mom staying in their home. He brings up the point that they share the home, so her decision affects him. When he suggests his mom should come too for support, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author is seeking support, which is understandable. Pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful, and both partners might need help. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive of his feelings and his valid concern about the impact on their shared living space. She's acting like her needs are the only ones that matter here, which isn't fair. The author's reaction is about wanting to be included in decisions that affect their home and his need for support. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. It's reasonable to expect that both partners' needs are considered, especially when it comes to their living arrangements. The girlfriend's reaction is rude and invalidates his feelings. The author isn't being selfish; he's trying to have a conversation about shared responsibilities and support. So the answer should be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
