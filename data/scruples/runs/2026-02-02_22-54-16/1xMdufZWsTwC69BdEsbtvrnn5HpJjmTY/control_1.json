Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple expecting a baby. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of months, but she didn't consult her partner first. The partner feels left out and suggests inviting his own mom. The girlfriend reacts negatively, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the actual work (pregnancy).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author (the partner) is upset because his girlfriend didn't include him in the decision. That's a valid point. Shared living situations, especially when expecting a baby, require communication and mutual agreement. The girlfriend's action of making a unilateral decision could be seen as dismissive of her partner's feelings and role in the household.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be under a lot of stress due to the pregnancy and seeking emotional and practical support. Her reasoning that her mom is her support is understandable, but she didn't consider her partner's feelings. When the partner brings up his own need for support, she responds negatively, which could indicate a lack of empathy or poor communication.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing a need for support and wants to include his mother, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is hostile, but the author's initial request isn't unreasonable. The issue seems to stem from the girlfriend not involving her partner in the decision-making process, which is a common problem in relationships. The author is reacting to being excluded, not necessarily being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's unilateral decision and her dismissive response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
