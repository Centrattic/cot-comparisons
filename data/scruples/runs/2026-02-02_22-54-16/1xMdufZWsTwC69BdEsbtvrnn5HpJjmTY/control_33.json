Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a month before and after the baby arrives. The author didn't like that the decision was made without consulting him, which is understandable because they share the home. When he suggested his mom should also come for support, the girlfriend dismissed his need, saying he doesn't do the real work. \n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual support. The author felt left out of the decision-making process, which is valid. He's right to want to discuss family arrangements that affect their shared living space. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, implying that his support isn't needed, which could be seen as invalidating his feelings.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he wasn't included in the decision. The girlfriend's reaction of calling him an asshole is clearly problematic. Even if the author's initial request might be seen as a bit reactive, the core issue is about mutual respect and shared decision-making. The girlfriend's statement about him not needing support because he's not the one doing the \"real work\" is a common but flawed assumption that undermines the importance of emotional and practical support for both partners during such a significant life change.\n\nSo, the author's stance is about being included in decisions affecting their home and seeking reciprocal support. The girlfriend's response was unconstructive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting support and being upset about not being considered. The answer should be B (No).\n"
