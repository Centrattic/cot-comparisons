Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support during pregnancy, but the author feels left out because he wasn't consulted and now wants his mom to come too. \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend made the decision without consulting her partner, which is a problem because they share the home. That part makes me think the girlfriend might be at fault for not involving him in the decision.\n\nThen, when the author brings it up, the girlfriend dismisses his request by saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical work. That's a bit harsh. Even though pregnancy and childbirth are primarily the mother's experience, the partner can still need emotional or practical support. The author's request for his mother's presence isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, calling the author an asshole, seems unfair. It's possible she's stressed, but her response invalidates his feelings. The author's initial frustration is understandable because he wasn't included in the decision-making process. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of immediately suggesting his mother, maybe he could have expressed his feelings first. But the girlfriend's refusal without considering his perspective is a bigger issue. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not consulting him and dismissing his needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
