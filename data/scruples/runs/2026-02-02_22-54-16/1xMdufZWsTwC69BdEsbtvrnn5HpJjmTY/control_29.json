I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting support from their mother when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend is upset because she already has her mom coming to stay. The key points here are communication and mutual support.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom staying, which the author finds problematic since they share a home. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, saying the author doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth. \n\nSo, the main issue is about feeling left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared living space. The author is seeking support, which is a reasonable request, especially during a significant life event like having a baby. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly invalidating of the author's needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel heard and supported. The girlfriend's mom coming to stay is a significant arrangement that affects both partners' lives. The fact that she didn't include the author in this decision could be seen as a failure to communicate. Additionally, the girlfriend's comment about the author not needing support because he's not giving birth might be minimizing the challenges the author might face, like adjusting to parenthood, handling the baby's needs, or other responsibilities.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the girlfriend is going through a physically demanding time with pregnancy and childbirth. She might be under a lot of stress, which could affect her communication style. That doesn't excuse her behavior, but it's a factor to acknowledge.\n\nThe author's request for their mother to stay is a reasonable way to seek support, and the girlfriend's refusal based on the assumption that the author doesn't need support might be a misjudgment. Both partners should work together to ensure both feel supported. The fact that the author brought up the issue and the girlfriend reacted negatively suggests a breakdown in communication and consideration of each other's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the girlfriend's response was inappropriate, and the author is justified in wanting to have their needs considered. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
