I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support, but didn't consult her partner. The author feels left out and wants their own mother to stay as well, but the girlfriend dismisses that idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a significant life event\u2014pregnancy and childbirth\u2014which can be physically and emotionally taxing. It's common for expectant mothers to seek support from family, especially in the form of help with daily tasks or emotional support. Her mother's presence might be crucial for her well-being, and she might not have considered her partner's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that since they share a home, the decision to have someone stay should involve both of them. Not consulting him might make him feel excluded, especially if there are practical concerns like space, finances, or differences in how they manage the household. The author's request to have their own mother stay seems reasonable as a way to balance the support they both receive, but the girlfriend's response was dismissive, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend should have discussed the move with her partner to ensure they're both on the same page. However, the author's reaction\u2014wanting to invite their own mother\u2014might be a valid way to seek support, but the girlfriend's comment that the author \"doesn't need support\" might stem from frustration or stress. \n\nIt's possible that the author is not entirely in the wrong because expecting mutual support in a partnership is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's need for support is also valid. The situation might highlight a communication breakdown rather than a clear right or wrong. But given the specifics, the author's desire for support and the girlfriend's unilateral decision could both be seen as contributing factors. However, the main issue is the lack of discussion from her side, which might make the author not wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
