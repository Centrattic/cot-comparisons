I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a couple of weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he doesn't mind her mom. He brings it up, and she says her mom is her support. He then suggests his mom should come too, and she responds by calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that since they share a home, her decision to have her mother stay without consulting him is dismissive. It's valid to want to be involved in decisions that affect their shared living space. On the other hand, the girlfriend is going through a significant life change and might feel the need for her support system. Her response to the author's suggestion seems harsh and dismissive. By saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work,\" she's undermining his role, which is unfair. Pregnancy and childbirth are physically and emotionally taxing, but the author is also part of the new parent equation and would need support as the baby arrives.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author wanted to be included in the decision-making, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction was defensive and invalidating. While the author might have a point in feeling left out, it's important to consider if there was a miscommunication. However, the way the girlfriend responded is definitely problematic. She's not acknowledging his feelings or the shared responsibility of parenthood. The author's request for his mother to stay is about needing that support system as well, which is fair. So, the main issue is the girlfriend's negative reaction and lack of consideration. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
