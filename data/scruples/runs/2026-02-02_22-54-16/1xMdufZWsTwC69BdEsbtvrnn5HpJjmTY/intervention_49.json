Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a guy whose girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The problem is that the girlfriend didn't consult him about this, and when he asked, she dismissed his concerns by saying her mom is her support. The author then suggests inviting his mom too, but she calls him an asshole, implying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that his partner didn't include him in the decision-making process. That's a valid point because when you're sharing a home, major decisions like having a parent stay should be discussed together. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly invalidating of his feelings and needs. She's prioritizing her own needs without considering his, which is problematic in a relationship. \n\nThe author's reaction is to ask if he can also have his mom stay for support. That makes sense because he's acknowledging the need for support, just like her. Her response that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth is not only dismissive but also overlooks the fact that both parents need support, especially the father who will be sharing in the responsibilities of a new baby. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's approach of unilaterally making a decision without discussion shows a lack of partnership. The author is trying to bring balance by expressing his need for support as well. So, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his right to be involved and to have his needs recognized. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
