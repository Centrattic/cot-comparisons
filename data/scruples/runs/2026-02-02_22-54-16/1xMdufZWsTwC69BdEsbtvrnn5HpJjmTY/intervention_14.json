I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for a few weeks. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him about her mom staying, and when he suggests his mom should come too, she dismisses him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple shares a home, so any major decision about having someone stay should involve both partners. The girlfriend not discussing her mother's visit with the author is a red flag. It shows a lack of communication, which is important in a relationship, especially during a significant life event like a birth.\n\nThen, when the author brings up his own support, the girlfriend's response is harsh. She calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\" This is dismissive and undermines his role in the pregnancy and upcoming parenthood. It's true that the physical demands of childbirth are on the mother, but emotional and practical support for the partner is still important. The girlfriend's reaction seems unfair and could create resentment.\n\nThe author is justified in feeling that his needs are being ignored. He's not wrong for wanting his mother's support, especially if he feels it would help him cope or contribute to the household during a stressful time. The key issue here is the lack of mutual consideration and communication. The girlfriend's behavior seems more problematic because she didn't involve her partner in the decision-making process and then dismissed his reasonable request.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there are big life changes, both partners need to be on the same page. The author's reaction is a valid response to being excluded from an important decision. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
