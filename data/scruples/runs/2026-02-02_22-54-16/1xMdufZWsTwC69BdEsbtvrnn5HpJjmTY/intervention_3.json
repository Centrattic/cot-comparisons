Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for two weeks before and a month after the due date. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he has no problem with her mom. When he asked, she dismissed his concerns, saying her mom is her support. The author then suggests inviting his own mom for support, but she gets angry, calling him an asshole and saying he doesn't need support because he isn't the one doing the \"real work\" (presumably the pregnancy and childbirth).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The girlfriend is asking her mom to stay, which is significant, especially since they share a home. It's understandable that the author would want to be involved in the decision. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and maybe a bit harsh, as she didn't include him in the initial discussion. \n\nHowever, the author's response to suggest his mom should also stay might come off as a bit defensive or trying to one-up her request. Even if he's feeling left out, the way he counters by bringing in his own family might not be the best approach. But the main issue here is that the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs properly. The author is asking for support as well, which is valid because having a new baby is a big life change for both parents.\n\nSo, the author's main point is about wanting to be involved in the decision and needing support. The girlfriend's reaction is unhelpful, and the author is asserting his right to family support. The key is mutual communication and understanding. Since the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included and for needing support, I think the answer is B.\n"
