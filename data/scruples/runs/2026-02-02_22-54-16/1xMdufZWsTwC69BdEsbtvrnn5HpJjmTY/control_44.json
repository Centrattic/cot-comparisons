I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend is making his mother come over without consulting him. The author feels left out and wants his mother to come too.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend didn't ask the author about her mom staying, even though they share a home. The author then suggests his mom should come for support, and the girlfriend responds negatively, implying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth. The author is upset about not being included in the decision and being dismissed.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and mutual support. The author's complaint is that the girlfriend didn't check with him about her mom's visit, which is a valid point because they live together. Shared living spaces require joint decisions, especially when guests are involved. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly undermining the author's need for support, which could be hurtful.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his need for support, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic because she's belittling his role and needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have his mom stay; it's about mutual support during a significant life event. The key here is whether the author's request is unreasonable. Since having a parent for support is common, especially during a baby's arrival, it's not unreasonable. The problem lies in the girlfriend's lack of communication and her dismissive attitude.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's response is the issue here. The author is justified in wanting to discuss the arrangement and having his needs acknowledged. The fact that they share a home means both partners should have a say in such matters.\n"
