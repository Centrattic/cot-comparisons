Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for several weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author feels upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's part of the household. When he mentions wanting his mom to come for support too, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about being included in decisions affecting their shared home. That makes sense because if someone is living there, major changes should involve both parties. On the other hand, the girlfriend is pregnant and likely dealing with stress and physical discomfort. Seeking support from her mother is a common thing for expectant mothers, as they prepare for childbirth and the challenges of a new baby.\n\nHer reaction to the author's suggestion about his mom is problematic. By calling him an asshole and dismissing his need for support, she's invalidating his feelings. The author has a right to feel that his input matters, especially since the guest's presence will affect the household dynamics. However, the author also needs to consider that pregnancy can bring emotional changes, and maybe her reaction was due to stress rather than malice.\n\nBut the main issue here is the lack of communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend should have discussed the arrangement with the author first. The author's request to involve his mother isn't unreasonable if he feels he needs support too. Parenting is a team effort, and both partners should feel supported. The girlfriend's dismissive response is what's really in the wrong here, not the author's initial concern.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions and words were the main issues, not the author's desire for support and inclusion in household decisions.\n"
