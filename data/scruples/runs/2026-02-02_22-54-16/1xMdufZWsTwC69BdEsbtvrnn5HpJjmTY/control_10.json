Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay for several weeks, but she didn't consult the author first. The author feels left out and suggests inviting his own mother, but the girlfriend dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" (like childbirth). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a shared home, so major decisions affecting the living space should involve both partners. The girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying, which is a big deal. Then when he wants to bring in his mom, she's dismissive. That seems unfair.\n\nThe author is upset because he's being excluded from the decision-making process. Having a newborn is a big transition, and both partners might need different forms of support. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him an asshole\u2014seems harsh. She's focusing on the physical labor of childbirth, but emotional and practical support for the father is also important. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend should have discussed her plan to have her mom stay, and dismissing the author's need for support is not helpful. The author isn't wrong for wanting that support; it's reasonable to expect help during such a significant life change. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's advocating for his needs and the situation's impact on their shared home. The girlfriend's response is the issue here, not the author's request for support.\n"
