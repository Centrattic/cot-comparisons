      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's pregnant and wants her mom to stay for support. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he felt excluded. He then suggests his mom should come too, but she responds negatively, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is going through a major life change with pregnancy and childbirth, which is physically and emotionally taxing. It's common for people to seek support from family during such times. Her wanting her mom to stay makes sense. However, the author feels left out because he wasn't consulted, which is valid because it's their shared home. Communication is key here. She should have discussed the arrangement with him first to ensure they're both on the same page.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might be seen as a bit selfish. By suggesting his mom should come too, maybe he's trying to assert his need for support as well. But childbirth is a significant event where the mother's support is crucial. The girlfriend's response, while harsh, might stem from stress or a desire to prioritize her own needs. However, calling him an asshole for wanting support isn't helpful. \n\nThe core issue is communication. The author did approach her, and she dismissed his concerns. He felt his needs were ignored. While he could have expressed his feelings more calmly, his desire for support isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's response was harsh and dismissive, which is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel heard, especially during stressful times. The author's request to involve his mom might have been a way to feel included. The girlfriend's reaction might have been more appropriate if she acknowledged his feelings instead of shutting them down. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of mutual communication and consideration. The girlfriend's response was harsh, but the author's initial reaction was to stand up for his needs. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's validly seeking support in a shared living situation. The answer would be B.\n"
