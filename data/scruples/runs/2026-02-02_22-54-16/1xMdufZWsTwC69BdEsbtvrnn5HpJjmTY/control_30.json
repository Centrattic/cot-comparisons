I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay, but didn't consult the author first. The author is upset about that and suggests inviting his mom, but the girlfriend dismisses it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is that his partner didn't ask him about her mom staying, even though they share the home. That's a valid concern because when someone is coming to live in your shared space, especially for a month, it's reasonable to discuss it together. The girlfriend's mom staying for two weeks before and a month after the due date is a long time, so the author would want to have a say in that.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that her mom is her support, and she thinks the author doesn't need support because he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy. That's a bit dismissive. The author's request to invite his mom is reasonable because supporting a partner through pregnancy and childbirth is a shared responsibility. Both parents might need support, whether emotional or practical, and the author's point is that he's also involved and should have his support system.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many societies, the mother's family often plays a significant role during childbirth, but the father's family is also becoming more involved. The girlfriend's reaction of calling the author an asshole is pretty harsh. It's not constructive and shows a lack of communication. The author is trying to express his need for support, which is valid, and being met with hostility might indicate that the relationship isn't balanced.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for his own support, which isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend didn't consider his feelings about shared living space. The author didn't outright reject her request but instead wanted to ensure his needs are also met. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's response is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
