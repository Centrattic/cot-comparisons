I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay at their shared home for a few weeks. The author feels left out because she didn't consult him first and then dismissed his request to have his own mom stay by saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical work of childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is seeking support, which is common during pregnancy and postpartum. Asking a parent for help is a typical need. However, the key issue here is communication. She didn't discuss the arrangement with her partner before making plans, which is a problem. Shared living spaces require mutual agreement, so not involving the partner in such a significant decision is a red flag.\n\nThen, when the author suggests bringing his mom, she calls him an asshole and dismisses his need for support. That's a clear emotional response and invalidates his feelings. Support isn't just about physical tasks; it's also emotional and practical. The partner's right to have their support system included is being ignored here. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive and possibly controlling, which isn't healthy in a partnership.\n\nThe author is reacting to being excluded from a major decision affecting their shared home. His request for equal support is valid. The girlfriend's response is not only hurtful but also undermines the importance of both partners having their needs met. So, the author isn't wrong for seeking support; the issue lies with the girlfriend's lack of communication and invalidation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
