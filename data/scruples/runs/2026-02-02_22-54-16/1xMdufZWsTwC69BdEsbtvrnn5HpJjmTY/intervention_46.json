I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom should come too, she dismissed him by saying he doesn't need support because he's not the one doing the work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author feels left out of the decision-making regarding their shared home. The girlfriend's response to his suggestion is dismissive and rude (\"you're an asshole\"), which seems unfair. The author is seeking equal support, which is a reasonable request since both parents are involved in the upcoming life changes.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her needs are more pressing due to the physical and emotional challenges of pregnancy, which is valid. However, she should still communicate her plans with her partner, especially since they live together. The author's reaction to ask for his mom's support is a valid way to express his need for help, even if it's in a different capacity. The girlfriend's response was harsh and invalidated his feelings, which could lead to resentment.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should discuss such significant changes in advance. The author's right to feel included in decisions affecting their shared home is important. The girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge his need for support, even if it's different from hers, might be undermining his role as a partner. However, the author could have approached the situation with more understanding of her stress, but her response was clearly the first wrong step.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions and words were more problematic. The answer should be B.\n"
