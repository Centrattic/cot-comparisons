I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay for about two months. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though he's part of the household. When he asked about it, she dismissed his concerns and said he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. The girlfriend's mother is coming to stay, which is a significant change. The author didn't object to the mother coming over but was upset about not being consulted. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, implying that the author's needs aren't valid.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. When a major life event happens, especially one that affects the household, both partners should be involved in the discussions. The author's point is that he wasn't included in the decision, which is reasonable. It's not about wanting to prevent her mom from coming but about being a co-decision maker in their shared home.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive. She called the author an asshole and invalidated his feelings by saying he doesn't need support. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if she's under stress due to pregnancy, responding in that manner isn't healthy. Both partners should acknowledge each other's needs, especially during such a significant life change.\n\nSupport systems are important for both parents-to-be. The author wants to have his mother stay as support, which is a valid request. The girlfriend's refusal based on the assumption that he doesn't need support is unfair. Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful for both people involved, and emotional and logistical support from family is beneficial for everyone.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. He's seeking inclusion in decisions that affect their shared living situation and is requesting support just like his partner. The girlfriend's response was inappropriate and dismissive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
