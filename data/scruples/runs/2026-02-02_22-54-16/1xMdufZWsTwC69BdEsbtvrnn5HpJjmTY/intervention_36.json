      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting support when their baby arrives. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who's pregnant, asked her mom to move in two weeks before the due date and stay for a month. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, even though they share the home. When he asked, she said her mom is her support. Then he suggested inviting his mom too, and she called him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nHmm, first, the author feels left out of the decision-making about their shared home. That's a valid concern. Shared living spaces should involve mutual agreement, so not being consulted feels like a problem. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive and maybe a bit unfair. She's implying that the author's role is less important, which could devalue his contribution. Pregnancy and childbirth are tough, and both partners might need support. The author's request for his mom's support isn't just about himself; it's about shared parenting responsibilities and having emotional support. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, and her statement that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" might overlook the fact that both parents need support in different ways. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be stressed and overwhelmed, leading her to be short-tempered. But that doesn't excuse her being disrespectful. The author's reaction is about wanting to be included and having his needs acknowledged. It's a two-way street in a relationship. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic. So I think the answer is B.\n"
