Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he's okay with her mom. The girlfriend responds by saying her mom is her support, and when the author suggests his mom should come too, she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is feeling left out of the decision-making about their shared home. Even if he's okay with her mom staying, the fact that she didn't ask him might be a big deal. Communication is key in relationships, especially when making decisions that affect both partners. If the girlfriend made a unilateral decision, that could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is going through a significant life change with the baby. She might be stressed and seeking support from her family. Her response, however, seems dismissive and hurtful. She invalidates the author's need for support by saying he doesn't have to do the work. That's a bit of a double standard. Even if the mother is there to help with the baby, the author might also need emotional support or help with other tasks. \n\nThe author's reaction of wanting his mom to come is a reasonable response to feeling unsupported. But when the girlfriend called him an asshole, that's a harsh reaction. However, the initial problem was her not involving him in the decision. The author is asserting his right to be part of those decisions, which is valid. The girlfriend's dismissal of his needs and the derogatory language are issues too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's expressing his feelings and trying to get support, which is appropriate. The girlfriend's response is more concerning here. The author's main issue is the lack of communication, which is a common relationship problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
