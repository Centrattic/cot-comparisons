      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives, but the girlfriend's mom is coming to stay, and the author feels left out because they weren't consulted and their request to have their own mom stay was rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend didn't ask him about her mother staying, which is a big deal because they share the home. The author brings it up, and she responds that her mom is her support. He then suggests his mom should come too, and she calls him an asshole and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work (childbirth).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about typical expectations in such situations. When a partner is expecting a baby, it's common for both families to offer support. The author's main issue is not getting to be part of the decision-making regarding their shared home. The girlfriend's dismissive response about him not needing support because he's not giving birth is a point of contention. \n\nIn relationships, especially when moving in together or having children, communication and mutual decision-making are crucial. The girlfriend didn't consult her partner about a significant change in their living situation, which affects both of them. The author's request for his mother's support is valid because having family support can be important for both parents. The girlfriend's reaction, calling him an asshole, is unkind and dismissive. Her reasoning that he doesn't need support because he's not the one giving birth might be a bit harsh, as both parents undergo changes and stress during pregnancy and postpartum. \n\nHowever, the author might also be expected to have discussed this earlier. But the main issue here is that the decision to have her mother stay was made without his input, which is a problem. So, the girlfriend is at fault for not involving him and for her harsh response. The author's desire for support is reasonable, and the girlfriend's reaction is inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
