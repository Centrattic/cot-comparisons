Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before the baby arrives and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, even though he's okay with her mom. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support. He then suggests his mom should come too for support, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author feels left out of the decision-making process because his girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying. That's a valid concern because it's their shared home. Not involving him in such a significant change could be seen as dismissive of his feelings or input.\n\nThen, when he suggests his mom come as support, she dismisses him by saying he doesn't need support. That seems unfair. Even if the physical labor of childbirth isn't on him, being a supportive partner and sharing the burden is part of the process. The author might feel he's being excluded from the emotional and practical aspects of the situation, which is important for a healthy partnership.\n\nHowever, her perspective might be that she's under a lot of stress and relies on her mom for support, which is understandable. But her response to the author's suggestion was harsh and invalidating. The author is asking for equal consideration, which is reasonable. The situation seems more about the lack of communication and mutual respect rather than the author being in the wrong. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
