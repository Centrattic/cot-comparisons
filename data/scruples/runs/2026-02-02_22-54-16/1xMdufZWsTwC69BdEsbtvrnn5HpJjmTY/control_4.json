      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting her mom to move in for support before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first and then dismissed his offer to have his mom help, saying he doesn't need support since he's not the one giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because the decision to have her mom stay was made without his input. They share the home, so it's a joint living space, and he might feel that major decisions affecting their household should involve both of them. His reaction of suggesting his mom come over is a way to get equal support, which the girlfriend rejects, implying that his role isn't as significant in the birthing process.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be feeling overwhelmed and seeking support from her family, which is a natural response. Pregnancy and childbirth can be stressful, and many women rely on their mothers for emotional and practical help. She might not have considered the author's feelings about the living arrangement, but her reaction could stem from her own stress and the physical challenges of pregnancy.\n\nNow, evaluating who is in the wrong. The author's main issue is the lack of consultation, which is valid. In a relationship, major decisions about shared living spaces should be mutual. However, his response was to suggest his mom as a countermeasure, which the girlfriend took as dismissive of her needs. The girlfriend's refusal might be because she's focused on her immediate needs, not considering the author's point about shared responsibility.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend should have discussed the living arrangements with the author before making plans, even if it's her family. The author's reaction, while understandable, could be seen as retaliatory rather than collaborative. Instead of suggesting his mom, he might have expressed his feelings about not being included and discussed how they can both support each other.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He did reach out and express his feelings, but his solution might not have been the best approach. The girlfriend, however, didn't include him in the decision. So, both have some responsibility here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one asking if he's at fault, the answer might hinge on whether his actions were justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was harsh (\"asshole\"), which is unkind, but the author's initial frustration is about not being included. The question is if he's wrong for wanting support. Since supporting each other is important in a relationship, maybe the author isn't wrong for seeking support, but his method of doing so might be flawed. However, the main issue is the lack of communication from her side. So, I think the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't entirely in the wrong; the girlfriend should have discussed the arrangement with him and her dismissive response was the bigger issue.\n"
