Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay, but she didn't ask the author first. He feels it's unfair because they share the home. When he suggests his mom should also come for support, she calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for equal support, which seems reasonable. It's normal for parents to want help, especially during pregnancy and after birth. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be stressed and focused on her own needs, which could explain her reaction. However, not involving her partner in decisions about their shared home is a problem. Communication is key in relationships, so not discussing the live-in arrangement with the partner is a red flag. The girlfriend's dismissive response about his need for support is also problematic because both partners should feel supported. The author's request to involve his mother isn't unreasonable; it's about mutual support. So, the girlfriend's reaction seems unfair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
