Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting her mom to stay for support before and after the baby arrives, but she didn't consult her partner. The partner then suggests his mom should come too, but the girlfriend responds negatively, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is feeling left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home. The girlfriend didn't ask him about her mom staying, which he finds problematic. His asking to have his mom come for support is a reasonable response to feeling excluded. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014that he's an asshole and doesn't need support\u2014seems dismissive and potentially invalidating of his feelings.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Since they share a home, major decisions like having someone stay for weeks should involve both partners. The girlfriend's unilateral decision might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's request to involve his mom could be about equality in providing support, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's response that he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work\" might stem from frustration, but it's not a constructive way to handle the situation. It also overlooks the emotional and logistical support that both partners might need.\n\nHowever, the author might be overreacting if he's focusing on his own support needs without considering her primary need for assistance during pregnancy and postpartum, which are significant. But the fact that he didn't get a say in her mother's stay could exacerbate feelings of being sidelined. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but the author's initial request for his mother to come might come off as dismissive of her situation, especially if her mother's presence is crucial for her well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, neither party is entirely at fault. However, the girlfriend's response was inappropriate. The author had a valid point about shared home decisions, and the girlfriend's dismissal of his feelings and the suggestion that his support needs are irrelevant is problematic. The author's request to involve his mother could use more consideration of her perspective, but he's not entirely wrong. The key issue is the lack of communication and the girlfriend's harsh reaction. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's response was more clearly dismissive and invalidating, and the author had a right to be involved in home decisions.\n"
