Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend expecting a baby and asking her mom to move in before and after the birth. The author (the boyfriend) is upset because she didn't consult him first. He then suggests his mom should come too, but she gets angry and says he doesn't need support because he's not doing the real work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is likely stressed about impending parenthood and turns to her mother for support. It's common for expectant parents to seek help, especially the mother who will be going through labor and postpartum. However, the key point is that she didn't discuss this with her partner first. That's a relationship issue because they share the home, so her decision affects him too.\n\nThe author, on the other hand, feels overlooked. He's not wrong in wanting to be included in decisions that impact their shared living space. His response\u2014proposing his own mother's visit\u2014might be a bit of a reaction to her not consulting him. But his girlfriend's reaction is also problematic. She dismisses his need for support, which is unfair. Both parents-to-be might need support, and expecting only the mother to seek help could be a problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did bring up his mother's visit as a reaction, which could be seen as a bit of a tit-for-tat. However, his initial request for communication is valid. The main issue is the lack of communication from her side. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about not being included. So, probably answer B (No).\n"
