Her latest is asking her mom to come over and stay about 2 weeks before she is due until about a month after. While I have no problem with her mother. I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well. She said I was an asshole that I didn't need any support as I wouldn't be doing any real work.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they want support when their baby arrives. The girlfriend wants her mom to stay for a few weeks, and the author feels left out because she didn't consult him first. When he suggests his own mom should come, she dismisses him, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is pregnant and likely feeling the need for extra support, which is understandable. It's common for expectant parents to seek help from family. However, the author points out that they share a home, so involving his mother might affect their living space. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom's stay, which is a valid concern because shared living arrangements require mutual agreement.\n\nWhen the author suggests his mom should come too, the girlfriend's response is dismissive and possibly invalidates his feelings. She implies that only she needs support, which isn't fair. Both partners should feel supported, especially during a major life change like childbirth. Her reaction of calling him an \"asshole\" is harsh and unproductive. It's important for partners to communicate and compromise, not to belittle each other's needs.\n\nThe author's request for support isn't unreasonable. Emotional and practical support is crucial for both parents. The girlfriend's response suggests she's not considering his perspective, which could lead to resentment. The author is justified in feeling upset about not being included in the decision and being dismissed when he expresses his need for support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issues are the lack of communication from the girlfriend and her dismissive attitude towards his needs. The author's desire for support is valid, and the girlfriend's response is what's problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
