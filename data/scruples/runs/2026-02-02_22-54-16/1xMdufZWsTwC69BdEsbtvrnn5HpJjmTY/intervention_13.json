I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who's pregnant, wants her mom to stay with them for a few weeks before and after the baby arrives. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and when he suggested his mom could come too, she called him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support since he's not doing the physical work of pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual support. The author feels left out of the decision-making process regarding their shared home, which is a valid concern. It's important in a relationship that both partners have a say in major decisions affecting their living situation. The girlfriend didn't consult him about her mom moving in, which could be seen as dismissive of his role as a partner.\n\nWhen the author brings it up, he's met with a hostile response from his girlfriend, who invalidates his need for support. Her comment about not needing support because he's not the one giving birth might be a common sentiment, but it's important to recognize that emotional and practical support is valuable for both partners during such a significant life change. The author's request to have his mom stay isn't about competing but about feeling supported as well. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be a deflection rather than addressing the author's feelings. She's prioritizing her own needs without considering the shared nature of their home. The author's desire for support isn't unreasonable, especially since they're partners and should be navigating this together. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions and response are more problematic. The author is asserting his right to be involved in decisions about their home and his need for support, which is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
