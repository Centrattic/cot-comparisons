I'm upset she didn't ask me as we share this home. When I asked her about it she said her mom was her support. I told her then I should invite my mother for support as well.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend is pregnant and wants her mom to stay with them two weeks before the due date and a month after. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first about her mom staying. He feels it's their home and she should have discussed it with him. When he brings it up, she says her mom is her support. He then counters by suggesting he should invite his mom too, but she gets angry and calls him an asshole, saying he doesn't need support because he's not doing the \"real work.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels he's involved in the decision-making about their shared home. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels she needs support, which is her mom, and she might be under a lot of stress from the pregnancy and impending parenthood. Her reaction seems harsh, but maybe she's feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he was excluded from the conversation about having her mom stay. It's reasonable for him to expect to be consulted since it's their shared home. The girlfriend's response of dismissing his need for support and calling him an asshole is definitely problematic. The author's suggestion to invite his mom is a valid point; support systems are important for both partners during such times.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In some cases, the mother of the expecting parent is the primary support, but that doesn't mean the other partner shouldn't have input. The key here is communication. The girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, which led to the conflict. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to be involved in decisions affecting their home. Her reaction, however, is more questionable. She's being dismissive and possibly not acknowledging his role as a partner.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to the situation. The girlfriend might be under a lot of stress and her hormones could be affecting her reaction. However, that doesn't excuse being rude. The author's main grievance is about being left out of the decision. If they're a team, important decisions about their home should be mutual. The author isn't wrong to feel that way. The girlfriend's response is what's more problematic here.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included in the decision about his home. His suggestion to invite his mom is reasonable, as support is important for both partners. The girlfriend's dismissive and hostile reaction is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
