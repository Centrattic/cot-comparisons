I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex is described as amazing and a saint, allowing the divorce to be amicable and still co-parenting. The author wants to give her a significant sum from the lottery to help her out, as she works a low-paying job. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex, but the author clarifies they still love the ex out of respect for her as a mother and co-parent, not romantically.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations. The author's intention seems to be to make amends, help the ex financially, and show appreciation for her past sacrifices. The ex was the first person they contacted, and the author's parents and lawyer support the decision. However, the girlfriend is feeling disrespected and threatened by this move. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intention versus the girlfriend's feelings. While the author might believe they're doing the right thing, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because unexpected large financial gestures can be seen as a breach of trust or prioritization of the ex over the current relationship. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nBut on the other hand, the ex is the mother of their children, and the author's actions are partly to support the kids' well-being. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or fear of comparison. The author's decision to go ahead despite the girlfriend's anger could lead to the breakup, which the author is somewhat relieved about. \n\nI need to balance these factors. The author isn't in love with the ex, but the financial gesture might still be perceived as favoring the ex. The girlfriend's feelings are important in a current relationship, so ignoring them could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the author hasn't discussed it with the ex yet might also complicate things, as the ex might have her own feelings about receiving money from an ex-partner. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention is positive, but the way they handled it (without consulting the current partner) might be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, so the author could be seen as in the wrong for not considering her perspective and for making a major financial decision that affects their relationship dynamics.\n"
