I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author won a large sum of money, around millions. They want to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their kids. They divorced six years ago because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as amazing, saint-like, and has been a good co-parent despite the pain from the divorce. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her and the kids. However, the current girlfriend is furious, thinks the author is disrespecting her, and might break up over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's intentions are to show gratitude to their ex-wife for being a good co-parent, help her financially, and support the kids. The ex-wife has been supportive despite the affair. The author's current partner is upset, feeling disrespected and possibly jealous. \n\nLegally, the author is giving money to their ex-wife. If the money is their own (like a lottery win, not part of shared assets), then they can give it away as they see fit. However, the emotional aspect is more complex. The girlfriend's reaction is significant here. The author hasn't discussed this with her, and she feels it's a breach of trust or respect. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's about whether the author's actions are appropriate given the current relationship. The author claims they still love their ex-wife but aren't in love with her. The ex-wife isn't opposing the gift, and the author's lawyer and parents support it. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected. \n\nThe question is whether the author's decision is wrong. On one hand, they're helping a former spouse who's been supportive. On the other, the current partner is upset, and the author might be prioritizing their ex over their current relationship. \n\nI need to weigh the intentions versus the impact. The author's intentions are good, but the impact on the current relationship is negative. If the girlfriend feels disrespected, the author's actions could be seen as insensitive. However, if the money is the author's to give and the ex-wife is a positive co-parent, some might argue it's not wrong. \n\nAlso, the affair was the author's fault, which complicates things. The ex-wife has moved on and allowed the father-child relationship to continue. The author's gesture could be seen as making amends for past mistakes. \n\nBut the current partner's feelings are valid. The author didn't consult their partner, which might be part of the issue. Even if the money is their own, giving a large sum to an ex without discussing it with a partner can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer could be AITA depends on perspective. However, in AITA posts, the community often considers how the action affects current relationships. Since the author's partner is reacting strongly and the action is causing conflict, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and potentially violating boundaries by giving money to an ex so soon after a divorce, especially with the history of an affair.\n"
