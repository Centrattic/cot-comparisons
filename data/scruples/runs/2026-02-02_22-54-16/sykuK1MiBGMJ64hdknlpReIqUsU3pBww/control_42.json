I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife was understanding and allowed a painless divorce, even though she was hurt. The author feels a sense of guilt from the affair and wants to make amends by giving her money. His girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful, and the author is considering cutting things off with her.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he wants to support them. He's giving her money to improve her life and show he cares. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so the money could help her. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling disrespected, but the author isn't in love with the ex-wife anymore. His lawyer and parents support the decision, which suggests there's no legal issue.\n\nHowever, giving a significant amount of money to an ex, especially when in a new relationship, can be seen as problematic. The girlfriend feeling disrespected makes sense because he's entering a new relationship with someone else who caused the divorce. The author's intention is to atone, but the girlfriend might feel it's a betrayal. It's a complex emotional situation.\n\nBut legally, unless there's a prenuptial agreement or other legal bindings, he can do with his money as he wishes. The ex-wife's acceptance of the money and the fact that she's a good co-parent might justify his actions. The author's intention isn't to reconnect but to make amends for his past, which is commendable. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but it's about their relationship dynamics rather than a legal or moral wrong by the author.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a personal decision to atone for past mistakes, and while the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the act itself isn't unethical or wrong. The key is that he's not in love with the ex-wife and is trying to do the right thing for their children and past relationship.\n"
