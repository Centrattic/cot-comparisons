I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the main points: The ex-wife is the mother of his two kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current GF. The ex-wife has been cooperative in co-parenting, even though the author admits he messed up. Now, he wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings to help her out financially, as she works a low-paying job. His GF is furious, thinking he still loves her, and the author is considering going through with the plan.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to make amends for his past mistake by supporting the mother of his children, which seems noble. The ex-wife was understanding during the divorce, so this gesture might be a way to show gratitude. Financially helping her could improve her quality of life and benefit the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF's feelings are valid. She might feel disrespected because he's giving money to his ex-wife soon after they started a relationship. The sudden large gift could be seen as a betrayal, especially if the relationship is still in its early stages. Even if the author isn't in love with his ex, the GF's emotional reaction is real and should be considered.\n\nLegal and financial aspects: The author consulted his lawyer and parents, who supported him. The ex-wife isn't entitled to the money legally, so it's a personal choice. However, gifting a large sum might have tax implications or affect future child support arrangements, but the scenario doesn't mention those details.\n\nEthically, it's a matter of balancing past obligations with current relationships. The author's intentions are good, but the GF's reaction highlights the sensitivity of such decisions in a new relationship. Even if the author isn't in love anymore, moving on from a previous relationship can be complex, and the GF might feel insecure about his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are admirable and his actions could be seen as just and kind, the situation is complicated by the current relationship dynamics. The GF's hurt feelings suggest that the author might not have considered the emotional impact on his new partner. However, the author isn't legally or morally obligated to consult his GF before helping his ex-wife, especially regarding their children. So, it's a nuanced case where both perspectives have merit. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as respectful to both the ex-wife and the current partner. Since the author isn't required to ask the GF's permission, but he's causing her emotional distress, it's a tricky spot. However, given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his intent is to help his children's mother, but he should handle the situation with care to maintain his current relationship.\n"
