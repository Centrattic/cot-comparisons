I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won, even though their current girlfriend is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author cheated on their ex-wife, which led to the divorce. Now they've won a significant amount of money and want to give a large portion to their ex, who's the mother of their kids. The ex is described as good-hearted and has been cooperative in co-parenting. The current girlfriend is angry, thinks it's disrespectful, and is considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex is the mother of their children, the author feels a sense of responsibility to her, and the ex is in a better financial situation now. The author's intention is to show care and help the kids. But the current girlfriend feels disrespected. \n\nThe author's actions are based on their feelings of guilt and responsibility towards their ex and children. However, giving a large sum without the girlfriend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust in their current relationship. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex anymore, the girlfriend might feel that the gesture is more than just financial\u2014it could imply emotional attachment.\n\nLegally, if the money is personal property, the author can give it to whomever they want. But relationship-wise, not discussing such a big decision with the partner is problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing that the author still has feelings for the ex. The author's relief at the breakup threats might indicate that the relationship is already strained, but the decision to go ahead with giving the money despite the partner's anger could be seen as prioritizing the ex over the current partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is a parent to their children, and helping her could benefit the kids. The author's parents and lawyer support it, which might mean there's no legal issue. But the main conflict here is between the author's sense of duty to their ex and children versus their current partner's feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. Legally, no. Emotionally and in terms of relationship trust, maybe. The author didn't consult their girlfriend, which could be seen as a mistake. However, their intentions are to help their children and ex-wife. But in a relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, so not involving the partner could be a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in the eyes of their girlfriend and possibly others who value relationship communication.\n"
