I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex a large amount of money from his lottery win. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man won a significant amount of money. He's considering giving his ex-wife, who is the mother of his kids, a substantial sum. The ex-wife is described as good-hearted, handled the divorce amicably, works a low-paying job, and the author still respects her. He wants to give her money to help her and the kids. His current girlfriend is furious, thinks he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is at fault. \n\nLet's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's trying to make amends for past mistakes (he cheated). The ex is a good co-parent, and he wants to support his kids. He's not in love with her anymore, just respects her. The money is for her benefit and the kids', which is justified. His parents and lawyer support him, which adds some credibility to his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend feels disrespected. She might feel that giving the ex money is a sign of lingering affection or a betrayal. Even if the author isn't in love, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's his current partner. The fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend might also be a point of tension. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which could be a problem in the relationship. \n\nBut the key points here are the author's intentions. He's not giving the money to his ex because he's in love but to support his kids and make amends. However, the act of giving a large sum without consulting his girlfriend could be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. Even if his intentions are good, his girlfriend might feel overlooked. \n\nBut then again, the ex is the mother of their children, and supporting the kids is a shared responsibility. The author might feel that this is his duty. The legal and parental support suggests that this isn't an unreasonable action. \n\nThe question is whether his actions are wrong. Legally, he's probably not in the wrong, especially if the money is his to give. Emotionally, it's more complicated. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's reasons are also justified. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the context of their relationship. If the author didn't communicate his intentions and the girlfriend felt betrayed, then maybe he's at fault for not being transparent. But if the gift is purely for the kids and ex's benefit, and the author isn't showing favoritism over his current partner, then he might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't discuss it with his girlfriend, leading to her feeling disrespected. But since the money is his and the ex is the kids' mother, he might not be in the wrong. However, the relationship aspect is tricky. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have validity.\n"
