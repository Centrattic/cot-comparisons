I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the context: The author won a significant amount of money, around millions. He's divorced from his ex-wife after an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex is a good co-parent, and he feels a sense of debt because of his past mistake. He wants to give her a substantial amount as a gesture of goodwill and to help her out financially. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with his ex.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angles. The author's motivations are about making amends and supporting his ex-wife and kids. He's not in a relationship with her anymore, so the money isn't part of their marriage. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected and possibly betrayed. The key points here are the author's intentions versus the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue because the money is his to give. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author is using the money to address past wrongs, which could be seen as commendable. However, involving a girlfriend in this decision is important. The fact that he didn't discuss it with his girlfriend first might contribute to her feeling disrespected. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction seems rooted in insecurity. The author isn't in love with the ex, just has respect and love for the kids and his ex's role as a mother. The girlfriend's threat to break up might indicate deeper issues in their relationship, possibly about trust or jealousy. The author's relief at the breakup suggests that the relationship was already strained.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the primary wrong is giving money to the ex, then it's not the author's fault, as he's acting on his own money and right to make such decisions. However, not considering the girlfriend's feelings might be a misstep, but it's not necessarily \"being in the wrong\" if his intentions are genuine. The ethical judgment here hinges on personal responsibility and mutual respect in relationships. Since the author's actions are aimed at making amends and aren't deceitful, the answer leans towards B.\n"
