I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a substantial part of it to his ex-wife. He mentions that they divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is a good co-parent and has been supportive, even though they don't talk anymore. The author feels he owes her this gesture as a way to make up for his past mistakes and to help her financially since she works a low-paying job.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry and thinks he's still in love with the ex-wife. He clarifies he's not in love anymore but still loves her for being a good parent. The girlfriend is threatening to break up. The author is considering going ahead with the plan regardless.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, from a legal standpoint, once divorced, there's no obligation to share the winnings unless specified in a legal agreement. Since he's consulting a lawyer and the lawyer is on board, maybe there's no legal issue. But the ethical part is more complex.\n\nHe wants to give the money out of a sense of guilt and to help her, which is commendable. But the girlfriend feels disrespected. Even if he's not in love anymore, the action might be perceived as disrespectful to the current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it can feel like he's prioritizing his ex over her. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he went ahead without her input, even if it's his money, it could be seen as not considering her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are good. He's trying to make amends and support his ex-wife and children. It's his choice to give away his money, but the way he's handling it might be insensitive to his girlfriend. The key here is whether respecting his girlfriend's feelings is more important than his gesture to the ex-wife.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether giving the money to the ex-wife is a breach of trust in the current relationship. Even if legally okay, ethically, if it's causing significant distress to his partner, it might be unwise. However, the author isn't obligated to share the money, and if he's decided to do it out of his own will, that's his right. But the conflict arises from how it affects his current relationship. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's his money and his decision, but there's a nuance in relationship dynamics.\n"
