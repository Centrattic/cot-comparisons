I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset about it, thinking he's being disrespectful to her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and they divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife has been pretty understanding, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives and kept things amicable. He's giving her the money as a way to show he cares, maybe to make up for his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support this. But his girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected and possibly thinking he's still in love with his ex.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? On one hand, he has a right to do with his money as he pleases. He might feel it's the right thing to do for his children and ex-wife. On the other hand, his girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel that he's prioritizing his ex over her, especially since he was the one who cheated. The fact that the ex-wife doesn't talk to the girlfriend adds another layer. \n\nBut wait, the author says he's not in love with his ex anymore, just loves her as a mother and co-parent. His intention is to help her and the kids. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling undervalued. However, the author hasn't discussed this with his ex yet, which might be a problem if she's not expecting it. Also, the fact that he's giving a large amount could be a financial decision that affects his current relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are his intentions, the impact on the girlfriend, and the relationship with the ex. If his intentions are genuine and for the well-being of the kids and ex, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being insensitive to his girlfriend's feelings, maybe he is. However, since he hasn't discussed it with his ex yet, maybe the issue is more about communication. The girlfriend's anger might be about feeling disrespected in the relationship. \n\nIn some cases, giving money to an ex can cause issues in the current relationship. The author's decision might not be malicious, but it's causing a rift. However, since it's his money and he's using it for what he considers a good cause (helping his ex and kids), it might not be inherently wrong. The problem might be more about how it's handled in the context of his current relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's using his money to support his children and ex-wife, which is a valid reason, especially given the amicable split and his ex's behavior. The girlfriend's reaction is about their relationship dynamics, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to help. However, there's a gray area because of the relationship with his current partner. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the action itself is giving money to ex for legitimate reasons, then AITA might lean towards no.\n"
