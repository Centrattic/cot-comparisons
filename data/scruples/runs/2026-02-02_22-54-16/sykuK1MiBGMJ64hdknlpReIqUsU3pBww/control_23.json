I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The situation is complicated because there are multiple factors involved.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce. Now, after winning money, he wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His reasons include gratitude for her handling the divorce well, her working a low-paying job, and wanting to support their kids. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with his ex.\n\nHmm, so from a legal standpoint, there's probably nothing wrong because the money is his to give. Emotionally, though, it's messy. The ex-wife is a good co-parent, so supporting the kids makes sense. But the girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid feeling. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore, but the girlfriend might not see it that way. There's a risk of the ex misusing the money or creating more tension. Also, the fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend could be a point against the author's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are noble: helping his kids and ex-wife. His loved ones support him. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but maybe she's overreacting. The key here is whether the author's actions are respectful to all parties. He's not obligated to explain himself to the girlfriend, but he needs to consider her feelings. However, he's also within his rights to make this decision. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication with the girlfriend. But the user just wants A or B. The main points are his right to the money, his reasons for giving it, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice, even if it causes conflict. So B.\n"
