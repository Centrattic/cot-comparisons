I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend being angry. The situation is that the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. Now he's won the lottery and wants to give his ex a significant sum. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but he says he's not. He still cares about his ex because she's his kids' mother and a good co-parent. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author's ex-wife was understanding during the divorce and has been a good co-parent. The author feels a sense of responsibility and gratitude towards her, which is understandable. However, giving a large sum of money after a divorce, especially when there's an ongoing relationship with a new partner, can be seen as problematic. \n\nFrom the ex-wife's perspective, accepting money from an ex might lead to complications, even if it's meant as a gesture. There's a potential for misunderstanding or creating tension between the current partner and the ex. The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling disrespected or perhaps fearing that the relationship is not fully over with the ex. \n\nLegally, the author might be okay because the money is his to give. But emotionally and relationally, it's a different story. The ex-wife might not want to be in a position where she owes money to an ex, and the current partner's feelings are valid. The author's decision could be seen as a breach of trust with his current girlfriend, even if he's not in love with the ex anymore. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to support the ex-wife's well-being and his children's future. If the ex-wife is okay with it and the author's lawyer approves, then there's a legal green light. But the girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue. The author is prioritizing his sense of responsibility and past, while the girlfriend is prioritizing the current relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are respectful to all parties involved. If the ex-wife is okay with the gesture and the money is given as a one-time gift without any expectation, then it's more about the author's right to decide how to use his money. But if the girlfriend feels disrespected and it's causing significant conflict, the author might need to consider the impact on his current relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, he's not, but relationally, it depends on how the ex-wife and current partner perceive it. Since the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral judgment, the answer might be A (Yes) because he's causing harm to his current partner's feelings, even if his intentions are good. Alternatively, it could be B (No) because he's acting on his moral obligation and the money is his to give. \n\nBut the girlfriend is his current partner, and her feelings are valid. The author might be neglecting the current relationship dynamics. So, maybe the answer is A. However, if the ex-wife is agreeable and the gesture is meant well, maybe B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's anger is a red flag, but it's also a personal choice. I think the answer is A because the action is causing significant distress to the current partner, and relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision.\n"
