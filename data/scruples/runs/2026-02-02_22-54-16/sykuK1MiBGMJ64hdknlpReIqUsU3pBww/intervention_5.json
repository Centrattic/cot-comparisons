I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. They divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as amazing and handled the divorce gracefully, even allowing him to stay in his kids' lives. The author feels he needs to give her the money as a way to show he cares and because she deserves it. However, his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex and that he's being disrespectful. The author's parents and lawyer support him, and he's considering going ahead despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. The author is trying to make amends to his ex-wife, who he wronged by cheating. He's giving her money to help her financially, which she needs. The ex-wife is portrayed as a good mother and has maintained a respectful relationship. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The author is in a committed relationship now, and giving a large sum to an ex might be seen as inappropriate because it could be perceived as favoring the ex over the current partner. But the author isn't in love with the ex anymore; he just loves the kids and wants to support the ex-wife.\n\nLegally, the author's lawyer is on board, so there's no legal issue. The ex-wife was informed but hasn't been given the money yet. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author feels relieved by the breakup threats, which complicates things because he's not entirely committed to the relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intent to help his ex-wife, the ex's positive character, the girlfriend's jealousy and misperceptions, and the author's own feelings of relief. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, giving money to an ex after a divorce, especially for the children's sake, can be seen as a responsible act if it's for their well-being. However, the timing and the amount might be problematic. The girlfriend might feel that the ex is being prioritized, even if the author's intentions are pure. But the author's actions are also about righting past wrongs. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid in feeling slighted, but the author isn't necessarily wrong in his intentions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and consequences. The author's intent is genuine and aimed at helping his ex-wife, which is commendable. The consequence is the girlfriend's upset, but the author isn't in the wrong if he's acting from a place of righting his past mistakes. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are motivated by a desire to support his ex-wife and children, and he's not being disloyal to his current relationship if he's not in love with the ex anymore. However, the situation is sensitive, but not necessarily his fault.\n"
