I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to his divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. Now, he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a portion to his ex-wife, who he feels has been saintly in handling the divorce and allowing him to stay in his kids' lives. His ex works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her financially. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, accusing him of still loving his ex.\n\nI need to consider a few things. Legally, unless there's a court order preventing him from giving money to his ex, he can do so. He's not under any legal obligation to get his girlfriend's approval. Emotionally, he feels it's a way to show he's not a complete failure and to help her. His ex didn't ask for it, but he wants to give it as a gesture.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected and possibly jealous. The author's actions might be seen as a betrayal, especially since they're in a relationship. However, the author isn't in love with his ex anymore; he's just appreciative of her. The girlfriend's reaction might be about insecurity or feeling that he's not over his past.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. He's not legally in the wrong, and his reasons are heartfelt. However, in a relationship, partners often have expectations. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which could be a point against him. But he's not obligated to consult her since it's his money. The girlfriend's threat to break up is a consequence of their relationship dynamics, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing. The key here is whether using his money to help his ex-wife is his choice, which it is. The author isn't wrong for that, even if it causes tension with his girlfriend.\n"
