I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to their ex-wife, despite their girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their children. The ex-wife was gracious during the divorce, allowed continued contact with the kids, and works a low-paying job. The author feels this gesture is a way to show appreciation and make things right after their affair with the current girlfriend.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is upset, thinking the author is still in love with the ex-wife. The author clarifies they don't love the ex-wife anymore but still care for her as a mother and co-parent. The girlfriend is threatening to break up because of this decision.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider a few things. The author's relationship with the ex-wife is primarily for the kids' sake and maintaining a respectful co-parenting relationship. The ex-wife's financial situation is mentioned, so the gesture could be seen as helping her out. The author consulted their parents and a lawyer, who supported the decision. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The main issue here is communication and mutual respect in the current relationship. The author didn't consult their girlfriend before making this decision, which could be a problem. Even if the ex-wife isn't a romantic partner anymore, the current partner's feelings matter. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing the ex-wife over her, which could lead to trust issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to honor the ex-wife's role as a mother and support the children. The amount given is significant but might be seen as a personal choice the author has a right to make, especially considering the ex-wife's financial situation. \n\nBut relationships require communication and consideration. The author might have a valid reason, but not discussing it with the girlfriend first shows a lack of respect for her feelings and the current relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because sudden major financial decisions involving an ex can strain the current relationship. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intention is good, but the lack of communication with the girlfriend is a problem. The decision impacts the current relationship, so both parties need to express their needs. The author might not be entirely wrong in their intention, but the way they handled the situation (not discussing with the girlfriend first) is a mistake. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication, even though their intentions are noble. However, others might argue that the author isn't in the wrong if the ex-wife's needs and the children's well-being are valid reasons. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the girlfriend's feelings are a significant factor, the answer might be A. Alternatively, if the author's actions are justified by their intentions and the ex-wife's situation, it could be B. I need to decide based on typical perspectives on such issues. Usually, relationships require mutual respect and discussion, so not considering the girlfriend's feelings might make the author at fault. Hence, answer A.\n"
