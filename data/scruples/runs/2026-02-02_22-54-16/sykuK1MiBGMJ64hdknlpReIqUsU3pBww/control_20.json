I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nSo, the situation is: the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife 6 years ago. Now, he's won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex. The ex works a low-paying job and the author wants to help her and their kids. He hasn't told the ex yet but his parents and lawyer are on board.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The author's ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he's trying to show gratitude for her being a good co-parent and for her forgiveness after his affair. He feels that this financial gesture is a way to acknowledge her sacrifices and improve their children's lives. His girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected and possibly threatened by the gesture, even though he's not in love with the ex anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to do something good for someone who he hurt, and his ex has been a positive co-parent. It's his money, and he has a relationship with his children, so wanting to provide for them makes sense. The ex works a low-paying job, so helping her financially could be seen as a form of support for the kids too.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that this act is a betrayal, even if there's no romantic involvement. She might see it as favoring the ex over her, which could create tension. However, the author isn't in love with the ex, just appreciative. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that the gesture undermines their relationship.\n\nLegally, the author can give the money to whomever he wants. But emotionally, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because sudden large gestures can be hurtful. However, the author isn't obligated to cater to the girlfriend's feelings in this matter if he's not cheating or breaking any agreements.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's not engaging in any illegal or unethical behavior, and his intentions are to support his children and former spouse, then morally he might not be at fault. However, the way he handles the situation could affect his relationship with the girlfriend. The key points are his intentions versus the girlfriend's emotional response. Since the author isn't cheating and the ex is a parent to their children, it's more about his right to decide how to use his money. The girlfriend's reaction is valid but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's acting out of a desire to support his children and ex-wife, which is his prerogative, even if it causes tension with his current partner.\n"
