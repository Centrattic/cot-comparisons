I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he won a lot of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is furious about this, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he has for giving the money. He mentions that he was unfaithful, which caused the divorce. He feels guilty and wants to make amends by helping her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. He also wants to ensure the kids have a better life. He didn't consult the girlfriend first, which is probably why she's upset. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he might have a right to give money to his ex-wife for the kids' sake. But emotionally, the girlfriend feels disrespected. Even if he's not in love anymore, his actions might be seen as prioritizing his ex over her feelings. \n\nThe key points here are intent and the impact. His intent seems genuine\u2014to make amends and help their children. However, not discussing it with his girlfriend first could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships often require communication and mutual respect. If he's giving money to his ex without considering how it affects his current partner, that could be problematic. \n\nBut also, he's considering his children's well-being, which is important. Maybe the girlfriend's reaction is partly about feeling insecure or not respected. The question is whether his action is wrong despite the good intentions. \n\nIt's a tough call. On one hand, supporting his ex-wife for the kids' sake is a valid reason. On the other hand, not discussing it with his girlfriend and causing her distress might be a mistake. The author might not be in the wrong because his intentions are good, but he could have handled the conversation better. Alternatively, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings first. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of the intent. If he's giving money to someone else without the partner's knowledge, that's often a red flag in relationships. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because it's about respect in the relationship. But if the focus is on the children and amends, then B (not in the wrong). Hmm. Maybe the right answer is B because his intentions are good, but maybe A because it's about how it affects the current relationship.\n"
