I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, which upset the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife was gracious, allowing him to maintain a relationship with their kids and kept the divorce amicable despite his betrayal. Now, after winning a substantial amount of money, he wants to give her a significant portion to help her financially and show his appreciation. His current girlfriend is angry and accusing him of still loving his ex-wife, leading to potential break-up threats.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to acknowledge his ex-wife's sacrifices and support the kids. His parents and lawyer support this. The girlfriend feels disrespected and hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles to consider: legal standpoint (since the lawyer is on board, maybe the division is acceptable post-divorce), ethical considerations (right to decide how to use his money), emotional impact on the current relationship, and the ex-wife's perspective.\n\nLegally, since he's the one who wants to give the money, and the lawyer approved, there might be no legal wrong. Ethically, he's not obligated to give her money, but he feels a moral duty. However, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because he's choosing to give money to an ex, possibly implying lingering attachments. The author claims he's not in love with her anymore, but the act might still be seen as disrespectful to the current partner.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction. She might feel that this act undermines their relationship, especially if there's a history of the affair. The author's actions could be perceived as prioritizing past relationships over the current one, which can cause jealousy and insecurity.\n\nBut the ex-wife is the kids' mother, and financial support could benefit the children. The author wants to provide for them, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The key might be whether the author considered his girlfriend's perspective before making the decision. He didn't discuss it with her, which could be a point against him.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the impact on others. The author's intention is to make amends and support the kids, but the method caused conflict. The girlfriend's reaction is a significant factor here. Even if the author's intentions are good, causing distress in a current relationship is a red flag.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. If giving the money is his right, he might not be in the wrong. But if it's causing harm to his current relationship without her input, that's a problem. The fact that he's relieved by the breakup threats complicates things, showing he might not fully consider her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author could be seen as not in the wrong because the money is his to give, and his intentions are to help his ex-wife and kids. However, the way he handled it without considering his girlfriend's feelings might be a mistake. But in AITA terms, the community might lean towards him not being in the wrong, as giving money to an ex is a personal choice, especially for the children's sake. So, answer B.\n"
