I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The story is about someone winning a large amount of money and wanting to give a significant portion to their ex-wife, even though their current girlfriend is angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The writer mentions consulting their lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So legally, there's probably no issue. In many places, after a divorce, there's no legal obligation to share lottery winnings unless there's a specific agreement. Since the lawyer approved, maybe the ex-wife is being given money as a gift, not as part of alimony or child support, which are separate matters.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The writer is motivated by gratitude and a desire to make amends because their ex-wife was understanding during the divorce. They also want to improve their children's lives. That's commendable. But they didn't mention discussing this with their current girlfriend first. The girlfriend feels disrespected and is threatening to break up. The writer might be in a wrong because even if they're not legally obligated, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. They should have communicated their intentions with her before making the decision, especially since it's a significant financial commitment. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration, and the girlfriend might feel neglected or not trusted if such a major decision is made without her input.\n\nAdditionally, the writer's ex-wife is close with their parents and has been a good co-parent, but the fact that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds another layer. The writer might be using this as a way to bridge some emotional gap, but the girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Even if the writer isn't in love with the ex-wife anymore, the girlfriend might feel insecure or see this as a betrayal. The writer's own feelings of relief at the breakup threats suggest that there might be underlying issues in the current relationship that need addressing.\n\nSo, while the writer's intentions are good and there's no legal problem, ethically, they might be in the wrong for not considering their girlfriend's feelings and for not discussing such a significant financial decision with her. It's important in a relationship to have open communication and to respect each other's emotions, even if the other person isn't the one receiving the money. The girlfriend's anger could be seen as a reasonable reaction to feeling disrespected, regardless of the motivations behind the gift. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their girlfriend's perspective and didn't communicate properly, leading to a breach of trust and respect.\n"
