I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his ex-wife are divorced, but they have kids together. The ex-wife is portrayed as being a saint, allowing him to see the kids and handling the divorce amicably even after he cheated. The author feels a sense of responsibility and gratitude towards her. He's not in love with her anymore, but he still loves her as a mother and wants to show appreciation for her past kindness.\n\nHe won a significant amount of money and wants to give her a chunk of it. He's discussed this with his parents and a lawyer, who support the idea. The main conflict is with his current girlfriend, who's upset, thinking he's still in love with his ex. The author clarifies he's not, but he's sticking to his decision.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. Legally, unless there are specific restrictions from the divorce (like alimony or child support terms), giving money to an ex is generally allowed. Emotionally, the author feels it's a way to make amends and support the kids. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel disrespected or not considered in such a major financial decision. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the author has a history with his ex-wife through their children. Supporting her could be seen as a way to ensure the kids have stability. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling unvalued or that the author is prioritizing his past over their present. However, the author isn't cheating or engaging in any harmful behavior; he's making a personal choice based on his history. \n\nThe key points are: the ex-wife's character, the author's intention to show appreciation, and the lack of legal issues. While the girlfriend's feelings are hurt, the author's actions don't inherently wrong her unless there's a breach of trust or agreement in their relationship. Since the author hasn't acted on any infidelity or broken promises, his decision, though it may cause tension, isn't ethically wrong. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
