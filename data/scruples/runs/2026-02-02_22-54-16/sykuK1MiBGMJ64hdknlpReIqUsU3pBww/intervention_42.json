I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They have two kids, and the divorce was six years ago due to his affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as generous, allowing him to see the kids and keeping the divorce amicable despite his betrayal. She works a low-paying job, so the money would help her.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love anymore but still loves her as a mother and co-parent. His parents and lawyer support him.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is giving money to someone who, despite his past wrongs, has been kind. The ex-wife's financial situation is a factor. Legally, unless there's a court order preventing him from giving money to the ex, it's his to give. But there's the emotional aspect with the current partner. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid feeling. However, the author's intention is to make amends for past mistakes and support the kids.\n\nThe key points are: the money is his to give, the ex-wife's good character, the support for the kids, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author isn't obligated to share the money, but he's choosing to do so for valid reasons. The girlfriend's anger might be more about how he's handling the situation rather than the act itself. However, not involving her in the decision could be a point of contention. But since he hasn't broken any laws or agreements, and his reasons are heartfelt and justified, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
