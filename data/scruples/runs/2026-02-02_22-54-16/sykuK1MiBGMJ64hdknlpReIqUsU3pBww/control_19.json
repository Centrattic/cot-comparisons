I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife, which is causing their current girlfriend to be very upset. The main question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex-wife is described as a good person, allowing the author to stay in their kids' lives despite the pain. The author wants to give the ex-wife money to help her out, partly as a way to show appreciation and make amends for past mistakes. The current girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking the author has lingering feelings for the ex.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author's lawyer is okay with it, but the girlfriend is not. The girlfriend might feel that the author is not considering her feelings or their relationship. The author says they don't love the ex anymore but still care for her and the kids. The ex works a low-paying job, so the money could help her. But the girlfriend is threatening to break up because she feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. The author is in a current relationship, and their partner is part of their life now. Giving away a large sum of money without discussing it with their partner could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the motivation is good, it's about how it affects the current partner. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing the ex over her, even if the ex is the kids' mother.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to do something good for the ex, who has been a good co-parent and deserves some recognition. The ex might need the financial help, and the author feels a sense of responsibility. However, the girlfriend's reaction shows that the author didn't consider her feelings in the decision-making process. In a committed relationship, partners usually discuss major financial decisions together. By not involving the girlfriend, the author might have gone against their partner's expectations of trust and communication.\n\nThe author's lawyer is okay with it, but that's about legal terms. The emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant here. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid reason for her anger. Even if the author doesn't have romantic feelings for the ex, the action could still be seen as prioritizing the ex's needs over the current partner's.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds another layer. Giving money to the ex might be perceived as taking sides in a situation where the current partner is already uncomfortable. It could escalate tensions between the ex and the current girlfriend, which the author might not have considered.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author's intentions are noble and their ex's situation is valid, the way the decision was made without consulting the current partner might be where the issue lies. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, and by not discussing this with the girlfriend, the author might have acted in a way that disregards her feelings and the trust in their relationship.\n\nTherefore, even if the action itself isn't legally wrong or ethically wrong in terms of the ex's needs, the author could be at fault for not considering their current partner's feelings and the implications on their relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is a red flag about how the decision was made, not necessarily the act itself. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration for the current partner's feelings.\n"
