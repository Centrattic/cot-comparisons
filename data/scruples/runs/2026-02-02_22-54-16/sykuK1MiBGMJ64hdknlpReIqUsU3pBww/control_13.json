I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to his divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. Now, he's won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife as a way to show he cares and help her out, considering her job is low-paying. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with his ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with his ex but still has affection for her because of their children.\n\nSo, the key points are: the timing of the affair (when he was married), the decision to help his ex-wife financially, and the girlfriend's reaction. Legally, since they're divorced, he can give her money, unless there's a court order preventing it. But morally or ethically, is he wrong?\n\nThe author's reasoning is about making amends and providing for his children's well-being. His ex-wife is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping the divorce amicable. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or seeing this as favoring the ex-wife. However, the author's intention is to help his ex and their kids, not to reconnect romantically.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to consider his girlfriend's feelings? Yes, but he might believe his ex-wife's needs are more pressing. The girlfriend's threat to break up shows the conflict. However, the author hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet, so he's in the planning stage. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. He's responsible for his children's welfare, which includes both parents. But giving money to an ex could be seen as crossing boundaries if it's not necessary for the kids. However, since he's already divorced, and if the money is meant for the kids, it's more justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger might be about feeling disrespected, but the author hasn't done anything illegal. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his actions are aimed at supporting his ex-wife and children, not romantic reasons. However, there's a social expectation to consider the girlfriend's feelings. But the question is about being wrong, not about relationship advice. So legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
