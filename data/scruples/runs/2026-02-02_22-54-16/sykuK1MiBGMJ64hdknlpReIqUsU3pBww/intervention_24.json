I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large amount of money won from the lottery to his ex-wife, which has caused his current girlfriend to be angry and consider breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is giving money to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his children, as a form of showing appreciation for her past kindness and to help her out. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the author wants her to have a better life for the kids. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves his ex-wife.\n\nSo, the main ethical considerations here are: the right to use his own money, the intent behind the gift, and the impact on his current relationship. Legally, the author is the winner of the money, so he can do with it as he likes. The ex-wife is a significant person in his life as the mother of his children and a cooperative co-parent. The author's intention seems genuine, to make amends and support the kids. However, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt, which is a valid emotional aspect.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If someone uses their own money to help a former spouse, especially for the sake of their children, it's often seen as a positive gesture. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. The author's actions might come across as prioritizing the ex-wife over his current partner, which can cause hurt feelings even if there's no romantic intent.\n\nThe author's lawyer and parents support him, which adds a layer of external validation. But relationships are about mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend might feel that the author didn't consider her feelings in making such a large financial decision. Even if the money is his to give, the way it's handled without consulting his partner could be problematic in terms of relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving the money without his girlfriend's input. On one hand, the money is his to give, and the intent is good. On the other hand, not considering his partner's feelings might be a mistake. It's a balance between personal ethics and relationship respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action itself isn't inherently wrong, the lack of communication with his girlfriend could be seen as a relationship misstep. However, since the money is his and the intent is positive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key factor is whether the action respects both the ex-wife's needs and the girlfriend's feelings. Since the author is aware of the girlfriend's reaction but still proceeding, it might be a matter of differing values rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
