I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, which his current girlfriend is very upset about. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gives. He mentions that he's trying to make amends because he had an affair with the current girlfriend. He feels guilty and wants to show his ex-wife that he cares, even though they're divorced. He also points out that his ex-wife is a good co-parent, which is important for their kids. His parents and lawyer support him, which adds some weight to his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is angry because she feels disrespected. She might think that giving money to his ex-wife implies he still has feelings for her. The author says he's not in love with his ex, but the girlfriend might not believe that. He also mentions feeling relieved about her breakup threats, which could indicate some emotional issues or lack of commitment.\n\nI have to weigh the intentions against the impact. Giving money to an ex-wife for her and the kids' benefit could be seen as responsible, but it's a huge amount and might affect the current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she's his current partner. There's also the question of whether he should have discussed this with her first, even if he wasn't going to change his mind. Communication is key in relationships, and not discussing such a big move might have contributed to her anger.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially. While his reasons are heartfelt and he's trying to do something good for his ex and kids, the way he handled it without considering his girlfriend's perspective might be where he went wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because it's a significant financial decision that affects him committing to her future. Even if his intentions are good, the action of giving away a large sum without her input could be seen as disrespecting her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his current partner's feelings and the relationship they're in.\n"
