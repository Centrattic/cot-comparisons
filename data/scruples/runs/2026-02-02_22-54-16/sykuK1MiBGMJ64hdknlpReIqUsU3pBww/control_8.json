I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of lottery money despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the situation: He won a significant amount, maybe millions. He's considering giving a big chunk to his ex-wife, who's the mother of his kids. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife was a saint, letting him see the kids and making the divorce amicable even though he hurt her. He wants to give her money because he feels guilty and wants to show he's not a complete screw-up. His parents and lawyer support it, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he's still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nHe has a legal right to his money, so from a legal standpoint, he can give it to whoever he wants. But the moral aspect is more complex. He's in a relationship now, and his girlfriend is upset. The key factors are: the reason for giving the money, his intentions, and the impact on his current relationship.\n\nHe's giving it to his ex-wife to help her, because she's struggling at a low-paying job, and to show appreciation for her being a good co-parent. But he's currently in a relationship where the girlfriend feels disrespected. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because he didn't discuss this with her first. Even if he's not in love with the ex, giving her a substantial amount could be seen as undermining his current partner.\n\nHowever, he's also trying to make amends for past mistakes. The ex-wife has been gracious, which adds a layer of moral obligation. But the problem is the current relationship. If he didn't consult with his girlfriend, that's a breach of trust and communication. Relationships require mutual respect, and not discussing such a significant financial decision with his partner could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, his intentions are noble: helping his ex-wife, supporting his kids, and acknowledging her sacrifices. But the way he's handling it might not be respecting his current partner's feelings. The girlfriend's anger is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing being treated as less important than his ex. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. Legally, no. Morally, it's a judgment call. If he's not in love with his ex but still respects her, giving her money might be okay, but he should've discussed it with his girlfriend first. By not doing so, he's neglected her input, which is part of being in a relationship. So, while his intentions are good, the lack of communication with his current partner is a mistake. Therefore, he's partly at fault for not considering her feelings, even if his decision itself isn't inherently wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because he's in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and the potential impact on their relationship, even if his motives are good.\n"
