I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who won the lottery is in the wrong for giving a large sum to his ex-wife, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the situation: He had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to divorce from his ex. His ex is a good co-parent, and he feels guilty. He wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings to support her and their kids. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disloyal or still in love with the ex.\n\nHe hasn't told the ex yet but discussed it with his parents and lawyer, who support it. The ex didn't ask for money, just was happy for him. The ex's job is low-paying, and he wants to help her out. His girlfriend is threatening to break up because she feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: Since they're divorced, he isn't legally obligated to support her unless there's a prenup or court order. But the lawyer is on board, so maybe it's legally permissible. The ex isn't asking for it, so it's a personal choice.\n\nEmotionally, he wants to show he cares and make amends. But the girlfriend feels betrayed. His actions might not be illegal, but could be seen as disrespectful to his current partner. However, he's a parent to the kids with the ex, and ensuring their well-being is a factor.\n\nThe key points are: Is it his right to give the money? The ex didn't ask, so it's his decision. But relationships involve mutual respect. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid because his decision affects their relationship. However, his reasons are about family and past mistakes. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the issue is with the ex, maybe not. But with the girlfriend, maybe he should have considered her feelings more before making the decision. However, he has a duty to his children and ex-wife as their parent. So, he's in a tough spot between two important relationships. \n\nIn summary, his intentions are good, but the way he handled it might have been abrupt. But unless there's legal obligation, he's not in the wrong for choosing to help his ex and kids. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but he's not obligated to her in the same way as the children. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
