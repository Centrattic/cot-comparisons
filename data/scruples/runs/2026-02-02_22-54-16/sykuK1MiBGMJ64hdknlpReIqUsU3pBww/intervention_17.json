I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from their lottery winnings, despite their girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from different angles. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a portion to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their children. The ex-wife was good to them during the divorce, even though the author had an affair. The author feels a sense of gratitude and a desire to make amends for past mistakes. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author is still in love with the ex-wife.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ex-wife's role as the children's mother, the author's intention to show appreciation for her past support, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author mentions that the ex-wife is close to their parents and has been respectful, even though she refuses to talk to the girlfriend. The author hasn't discussed this with the ex-wife yet but has gotten their parents' and lawyer's support.\n\nNow, considering the moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, after a divorce, there's no obligation for one ex-spouse to give money to the other unless there's a court order. However, the author is choosing to do this voluntarily, which might not be legally binding but is a personal decision. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and fearing the author's lingering feelings for the ex-wife. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author wants to acknowledge the ex-wife's contributions and improve their children's lives by providing financial support. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so this could help her pursue her hobbies and perhaps provide a better environment for the kids. The author's intentions seem to be goodwill and reconciliation for their children's sake, not romantic feelings. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel that the author is showing favoritism to the ex-wife, especially since the ex-wife doesn't like her. The author might be perceived as prioritizing the ex-wife's needs over their current partner's, which could strain their relationship. But the author hasn't acted on it yet and is considering the ex-wife's well-being and the children's.\n\nAnother angle is the financial decision. Giving away a large sum could affect the author's current financial situation, especially if they have obligations to their girlfriend or their children's future. The author's parents and lawyer support this, which adds some credibility to the idea that it's a reasonable decision.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or feeling overshadowed by the ex-wife, especially since the ex-wife is the mother of their children. The author's honesty about still loving the ex-wife, albeit not romantically, could be causing tension. The author might need to communicate their intentions clearly to the girlfriend to alleviate fears of being replaced or not being a priority.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a mix of intentions versus consequences. The author's intention is to do good for the ex-wife and kids, which is commendable. However, the method of doing so without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong for the action itself, but they might be in the wrong for not addressing or discussing this decision with their girlfriend first, leading to hurt feelings and potential relationship issues.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are based on positive intentions, but the communication (or lack thereof) with their girlfriend is a key issue. The answer could hinge on whether the author is obligated to consider their partner's feelings in such decisions. If the author proceeds without regard for their girlfriend's emotions, that could be seen as wrong. However, if the intention is genuinely good and the girlfriend's reaction is based on personal insecurities, the author might not be entirely at fault.\n"
