I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from their lottery winnings, which is causing conflict with their current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as a good person who allowed a painless divorce despite the betrayal. Now, the author wants to give her a significant sum of money as a gesture of appreciation and to help her out, especially since she works a low-paying job. The ex-wife is supportive of the kids and has a good relationship with the author's parents.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset about this plan. She's angry, thinks it's a sign the author still loves their ex-wife, and is threatening to break up. The author feels relieved at the breakup threats but is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's intentions. They want to help their ex-wife, who they respect and love for being a good mother and co-parent. The gift is not for romantic reasons but to acknowledge past mistakes and support their children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly jealous, but the author isn't in love with their ex anymore.\n\nLegally, if the money is the author's to give, they can decide how to use it. Emotionally, the girlfriend might feel hurt, but the author isn't doing anything unethical if their intentions are pure. The ex-wife isn't a third party in the current relationship in a romantic sense, so giving her money isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author should consider the impact on their current relationship. But since they haven't acted on it yet, it's a matter of their right to make this decision versus the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, unless the author is still in a legal or binding relationship with their ex-wife, giving her money shouldn't be wrong. The main issue is the girlfriend's feelings, but that doesn't make the author inherently wrong; it's more about their relationship dynamics. The author might need to communicate better with their girlfriend to address her concerns, but the act of giving the money itself isn't necessarily wrong given the context.\n"
