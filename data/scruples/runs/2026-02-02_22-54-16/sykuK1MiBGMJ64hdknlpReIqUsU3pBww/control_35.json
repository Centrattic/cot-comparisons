I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum to their ex-wife. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. They want to give a large portion to their ex-wife, who's the mother of their kids. The ex-wife was hurt by the author's affair with the current girlfriend, but they co-parent well. The author's girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and accused of the man not being over his ex.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's intentions are good: showing care, helping the ex with her finances, and supporting the kids. They involved their parents and a lawyer, which is responsible. But the girlfriend feels wronged, and their relationship is now in jeopardy.\n\nHowever, the author is not legally obligated to give the money. It's their money to give, especially since the ex-wife is the kids' mother and they co-parent well. The author isn't in a current relationship with the ex, so giving her money isn't about continuing that relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling undervalued.\n\nBut the problem is the girlfriend's reaction. If the author didn't consult her, that could be a point. However, there's no legal obligation to consult a partner on such decisions. The author's actions are out of personal responsibility and care for the kids and ex-wife.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger could stem from insecurity or feeling replaced. The author might have ignored her feelings, but the decision itself isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author's actions were unjustified. Since the money is theirs to give and the intentions are noble, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about the relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider if there's any ethical angle where it's inappropriate to give such a large sum to an ex, especially if the current partner feels disrespected. However, without legal obligations and given the co-parenting context, the author's action is just a personal choice. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of relationship expectations, but the author isn't wrong for making this decision.\n"
