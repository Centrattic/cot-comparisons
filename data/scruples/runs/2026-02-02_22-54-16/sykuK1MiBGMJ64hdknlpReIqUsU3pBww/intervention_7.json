I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author won a large sum of money, several million dollars. He wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of his two kids, and they divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a good person who handled the divorce amicably, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives despite the pain. The author feels he should give her some money as a way to show appreciation for her sacrifices and to help her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this, but his current girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he's still in love with his ex.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, he's trying to do something good for someone who was important in his life, even after a past mistake. He's not in love with his ex anymore, just has respect and love for his kids. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, but the author's actions are towards someone else. However, the relationship dynamics with his current girlfriend might be affected by this decision. Legally, he can give the money to whomever he wants, especially if it's his own winnings. But relationships can be more about feelings than legality.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to make amends and support his kids' mother. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel sidelined or not respected. But the author's ex-wife is a separate person, and the author's actions toward her don't directly impact his current relationship unless they are part of the relationship's boundaries. If the author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend beforehand, that could be a point of conflict. However, the author's reasons are rooted in genuine appreciation and support for his children's well-being.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he had discussed it with his girlfriend and they had agreed, that would be better. But since the decision is based on his own moral compass and supports his children's interests, maybe he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid in terms of feeling hurt, but the author's actions are not inherently unethical or wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
