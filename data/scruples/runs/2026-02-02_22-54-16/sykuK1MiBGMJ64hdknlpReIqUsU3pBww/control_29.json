I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of lottery money, despite his girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife allowed a smooth divorce and co-parenting. The author wants to give her a significant sum because he feels it's a way to acknowledge his past mistakes and help her financially, as she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves his ex-wife.\n\nNow, considering the options. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the history of the affair, the ex-wife's role as a co-parent, the financial aspect, and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions seem respectful towards his ex-wife. He's trying to make amends for the affair by providing financial support for their children and enabling her to pursue hobbies. The ex-wife is portrayed as someone who's handled the divorce amicably and is still a good co-parent. The lawyer's approval might indicate that there's no legal issue with this, especially if it's about the children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is still emotionally invested in his ex-wife, even though he clarifies he's not in love but still loves her as a parent. The girlfriend's threat to break up could be valid if she feels disrespected or if the financial gesture is seen as an overstep, especially if there's no legal obligation to support the ex-wife anymore. But the author's intention is to help the kids and support the ex-wife's well-being, not as part of their divorce settlement but as a personal choice.\n\nThe main conflict here is between the author's desire to do something kind for his ex-wife and his current relationship. Since the money is being given voluntarily and not as part of any obligation, and considering the ex-wife's positive role in his children's lives, it's a personal decision. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important. The author didn't seek her input, which might be the root of her anger. But if there's no legal or ongoing financial ties, giving the money might not be the author's fault. It's a matter of personal ethics and how the action affects the current relationship. The ex-wife's reaction isn't mentioned, but she was happy about the win initially. The author's parents and lawyer support the gesture, which suggests some level of social and legal acceptability. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author is acting out of a desire to support his children's mother and it's a personal choice, even though he should have communicated better with his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is about their relationship dynamics, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making this decision.\n"
