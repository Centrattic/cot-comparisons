I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a significant amount of money, millions, and he's considering giving a large sum to his ex-wife. He and his ex-wife split up six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. Now his girlfriend is angry and threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He mentioned talking to his lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So maybe legally, there's no issue. If the money is his to give, then it's probably okay. But maybe there were some agreements from the divorce. If the ex-wife already got her fair share in the divorce settlement, giving her more could be seen as problematic, but if the lawyer said it's okay, then maybe that's settled.\n\nNext, the emotional side. He says he still loves his ex-wife for being a good mother and co-parent, but he's not in love with her. The girlfriend is upset because he's giving money to his ex, which might make her feel neglected or that he's not over their past. Even if he's not in the wrong legally, in a relationship context, partners often expect discussion about such major decisions. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable; she might feel that this action shows a lack of commitment to their new relationship. \n\nThe ex-wife was supportive during the divorce and continues to be a good co-parent. The author wants to show gratitude and support, especially since his ex works in a low-paying job. But the girlfriend's anger could stem from feeling that this money is being given to someone from his past, possibly affecting their future together. Even though the author says he's not in love with his ex, the act of giving a large sum might be seen as prioritizing that past relationship in a way that's not fair to the current partner.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex-wife refuses to talk to the current girlfriend might add tension. The author is choosing to support his ex despite that, which the girlfriend might interpret as not respecting her or the boundary between their relationship and his past. \n\nWhile the author's intentions are good, the key point is whether he was wrong in making this decision without discussing it with his current girlfriend. In relationships, especially when involving such life-changing amounts of money, transparency is important. The girlfriend's reaction, though extreme, is a sign that this might have been a poor decision not to discuss with her first. \n\nSo, even though there's no legal fault, the social and relational aspects suggest that the author could be in the wrong, at least in terms of how it's affecting his current relationship. Answer A seems to fit because the girlfriend's perspective is valid, and maybe he should have considered her feelings before proceeding.\n"
