I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by giving his ex-wife a large lottery win, causing his current girlfriend to be angry.\n\nFirst, the context: He won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a substantial sum to his ex-wife, who is a good co-parent but doesn't talk to his current girlfriend. He hasn't discussed it with his ex yet but has talked to his parents and lawyer. His girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and accused him of still loving his ex.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nHe's giving money to his ex-wife. Is there a legal issue? The lawyer is on board, so probably not. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, so there's a parental responsibility angle. He wants to ensure the kids have a better life. That's a valid point.\n\nBut from a relationship perspective, his girlfriend is upset. He didn't consult her before making the decision. In a committed relationship, major financial decisions involving other people, especially a previous partner, might be expected to be discussed. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here. She might feel he didn't respect her enough to include her in such a big decision.\n\nHe mentions he still loves his ex-wife but isn't in love. The girlfriend might feel threatened by his emotional ties. The act of giving money could be seen as a gesture of lingering emotional attachment, which might not be fair to the current partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife is a saintly figure, took care of the kids, and the author wants to make amends for his past mistake. His intentions are good. But did he consider his current partner's perspective? The girlfriend's anger is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing future issues with his ex-wife.\n\nThe author might argue that the decision is personal and about his children and past. But in a relationship, significant financial actions involving other people can impact the current partner's trust and security. Not discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. Legally and morally towards his ex, he's probably okay. But relationship-wise, not consulting his girlfriend is a problem. The answer might hinge on whether the act of giving money without discussion was respectful to his current partner's feelings.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency is key. Even if the author had good intentions, not involving his girlfriend in such a major decision could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, maybe he is in the wrong from the relational standpoint, even if his actions towards the ex-wife are justified.\n"
