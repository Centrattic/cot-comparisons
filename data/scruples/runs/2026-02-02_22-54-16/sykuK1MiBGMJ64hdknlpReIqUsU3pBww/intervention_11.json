I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend being upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to his divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife has been a saint, allowing him to maintain a relationship with their kids and handling the divorce amicably. Now, he's won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife to help her out, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex-wife.\n\nThe key points here are the man's intentions. He's not in love with his ex-wife anymore but still feels a sense of responsibility and gratitude towards her for her role as a mother and co-parent. He wants to show appreciation and support. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels disrespected and possibly jealous or insecure. \n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he can probably do so. However, relationships often involve unspoken expectations. The girlfriend might feel that giving money to an ex-wife is inappropriate, especially given the history of his affair. Even if he's not in love anymore, the action could be perceived as a betrayal of trust or emotional commitment to his current partner.\n\nBut then again, the man's actions are motivated by a desire to right past wrongs and support his children's mother. His ex-wife has been cooperative and kind, and the money is meant to improve her life. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own insecurities than the man's actions being inherently wrong. \n\nI need to weigh the moral aspects here. Is it wrong to support a former spouse for valid reasons? The man isn't continuing the relationship, just acknowledging past responsibilities. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter in their relationship. If he goes through with it despite her objections, it might cause lasting damage to their relationship. But the question is whether he's wrong, not just if the girlfriend is justified in her anger.\n\nConsidering both sides, the man's intention isn't malicious. He's trying to do the right thing by his ex-wife and children. However, not discussing this thoroughly with his current partner before making the decision could be seen as a misstep. But since he's already consulted his parents and lawyer, maybe he's making a responsible choice. So, in terms of right or wrong, maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
