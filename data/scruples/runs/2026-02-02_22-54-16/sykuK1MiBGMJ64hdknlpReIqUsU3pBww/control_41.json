I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves giving a large lottery win to an ex-wife, which upsets the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the man won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife, who he considers to have been saint-like during their divorce. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, works a low-paying job, and he feels this gesture would help her. His parents and lawyer agree with him. However, his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and accused of still being in love with the ex. He's considering going through with the plan despite her anger.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. **Intentions**: The man's intent is to atone for past mistakes and help his ex-wife. He's not in love with her but values her as a co-parent and a good person. \n2. **Communication**: He hasn't discussed this with his ex-wife yet but has talked to his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's reaction is a major point of conflict.\n3. **Relationship Dynamics**: The girlfriend feels disrespected and threatened. The man's actions could be seen as prioritizing his ex over his current partner, which might be problematic in their relationship. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the lawyer's approval suggests there's no legal issue. Emotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling disrespected in a relationship is a serious issue. However, the man's decision is based on his desire to make amends to his ex-wife for past wrongs and support their children. \n\nThe question is whether his actions are morally wrong. Since he's not in love with his ex but wants to help her and the kids, his intentions are good. However, the girlfriend's feelings about being disrespected are important. The man might be in the right if his actions are about reconciliation and child support, but if he's prioritizing his ex over his current partner without considering her feelings, that could be an issue. \n\nThe ex-wife is also part of their children's lives, so supporting her could be in the kids' best interest. However, the girlfriend's reaction highlights the importance of communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The man might need to consider how his actions affect his current partner and whether there's a way to address her concerns while still helping his ex-wife. \n\nIn conclusion, the man's actions are based on good intentions to help his ex-wife and children, but he may have overlooked the impact on his current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the man might be in the wrong if he dismisses her concerns. However, if the primary motivation is for the children's well-being and the ex's financial support, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are to help his ex-wife and kids, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important and should be addressed through communication and compromise.\n"
