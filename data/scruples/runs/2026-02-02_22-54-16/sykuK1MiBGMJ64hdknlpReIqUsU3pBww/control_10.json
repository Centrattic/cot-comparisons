I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author giving a large amount of money to their ex-wife, which their current girlfriend is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author won a significant amount of money, enough to change their life. They want to give a substantial portion to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their children and handled the divorce amicably after the author had an affair. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the author feels this money would help her and their kids. However, the current girlfriend is angry, accuses the author of still loving the ex-wife, and is threatening to break up. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The author has a legal and moral responsibility towards their children, so providing for them could be seen as justified. The ex-wife's role as a co-parent and her past forgiveness might support the author's decision. However, the relationship with the current girlfriend is also important. The author didn't consult the girlfriend before making this decision, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the author argues they aren't in love with the ex-wife anymore, just care for her as a co-parent.\n\nLegal aspects: The author's lawyer is on board, so there's no legal issue. Financial decisions post-divorce might be separate, but since the author is gifting the money to the ex-wife, it's their choice as long as it doesn't affect the children's welfare or legal obligations.\n\nEmotional and relational factors: The girlfriend's anger is valid because sudden large financial commitments can affect a partner's sense of security. The author might have a duty to communicate such decisions with their current partner, even if it's not a shared asset. But the author's reasons are heartfelt, aiming to right past wrongs and support the kids.\n\nPossible arguments for AITA being 'No' (B): The author is acting out of love for their children and respect for the ex-wife's past forgiveness. They didn't owe the ex-wife money, but they're choosing to give it as a gesture. The girlfriend's reaction might be overstepping if the author isn't obligated to consult her.\n\nPossible arguments for AITA being 'Yes' (A): The author didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective and feelings, leading to conflict. The decision could be seen as favoring the ex-wife over the current partner, even if well-intentioned. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or financially insecure because of the sudden large expenditure.\n\nWeighing these factors, the author's intentions are noble, but the lack of communication with the current partner is a key issue. However, the decision to support the ex-wife and children isn't inherently wrong. The primary wrong might be in not discussing it with the girlfriend, but the act of giving the money itself is not unethical if it doesn't harm others. Therefore, the answer leans towards 'No' (B) the author is not in the wrong.\n"
