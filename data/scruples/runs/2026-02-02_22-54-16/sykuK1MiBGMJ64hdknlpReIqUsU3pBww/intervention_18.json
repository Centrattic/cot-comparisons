I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a large sum of money from a lottery win to an ex-wife, despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person had an affair with their current girlfriend, leading to divorce from their ex-wife. The ex is still involved with the kids, works a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her financially. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it disrespects her and suggests the author is still in love with the ex.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex is a good co-parent and deserves support. They also mention consulting their parents and a lawyer who are on board. The girlfriend's reaction is anger and threats to break up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. From the author's side, providing financial support to an ex-spouse for the children's well-being and recognizing her sacrifices could be seen as responsible and compassionate. However, the girlfriend might feel betrayed or neglected, especially if they had unspoken expectations about financial priorities.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and ethical aspects. If the divorce was finalized and there are no legal restrictions on the author's winnings, giving money to the ex might be legally permissible. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's reasons are rooted in familial duty and gratitude, but the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded are valid. The affair also complicates things, as the author was the one who cheated, which might affect perceptions of fairness.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling that the ex is being prioritized over her. The author's decision to go ahead despite her objections might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, but if the author believes it's necessary for the kids and the ex's well-being, others might sympathize.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, there's often a balance between personal responsibility and respecting others' feelings. The author is trying to make amends for past mistakes, which is commendable, but the girlfriend's reaction is also a valid emotional response. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are considered respectful to both the ex and the current partner.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intentions are good\u2014supporting their children and ex-wife. However, the way they chose to handle it without the girlfriend's input might have been a misstep. But the core act of giving money for a valid reason isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but the author's actions aren't malicious. So the answer is B.\n"
