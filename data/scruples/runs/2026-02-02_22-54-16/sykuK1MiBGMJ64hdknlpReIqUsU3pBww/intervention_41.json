I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex is described as a saintly figure who allowed the kids to have a relationship with the author. The author feels guilty and wants to show his ex that he's not a complete failure by giving her a significant amount of money. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex. The author clarifies he's not in love with her, just loves her as a mother to their kids.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. From the author's point of view, he's trying to make amends for his past mistakes. The ex-wife deserves support, especially since she's working a low-paying job. The money would help her and allow her to pursue hobbies. The author's intentions seem genuine here\u2014wanting to show care and provide better for the kids.\n\nBut from the girlfriend's perspective, this could be seen as a betrayal. She's the one he's currently in a relationship with, and giving such a large amount to an ex might be hurtful. It could be viewed as favoring the ex over his current partner, especially since the affair initiated the divorce. The girlfriend's anger is understandable as she might feel disrespected or undervalued. \n\nHowever, the author hasn't actually given the money yet. He's planning to, and the girlfriend is threatening to break up. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, there's no issue if the money is his to give. The ex is the mother of his children, so supporting them could be seen as a parental duty. Emotionally, though, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. \n\nIs there a cultural norm that supports helping ex-spouses for the sake of children? Possibly. But in many contexts, people might expect the current partner's feelings to be prioritized. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting his current relationship for past obligations. \n\nStill, the author's intention is to rectify past wrongs and support the children's mother. If the ex uses the money to benefit the kids, maybe that's justified. But the girlfriend's reaction is a significant factor here. The author might be ignoring her emotional needs, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is truly not in love with the ex and wants to support the kids, is it wrong to help the mother? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't obligated to give money, but choosing to do so might not be wrong, especially given the circumstances. The key issue is whether the author's actions are respectful to both his ex and his current partner. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's intentions are also understandable. The answer might depend on whose perspective we prioritize. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the money is his to give, and the ex's role as a mother, the answer might lean towards 'not in the wrong.' However, the impact on the current relationship is a concern. But the author's actions don't necessarily violate any clear moral rules. So, probably answer B.\n"
