I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win. The ex is the mother of their kids, and they divorced because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex is described as a saint, allowing the author to see the kids and being respectful. The author feels they want to give her money as a way to show they care and help her out since she works a low-paying job. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author is still in love with the ex.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions are key here. They mention they still love the ex as a co-parent and mother of their kids, not romantically. The money is to help her and improve their children's lives. The ex was the first person they told, and she was happy for them. The lawyer and parents support this decision. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, maybe because of insecurity or feeling disrespected. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to give the money, but they're doing it out of a sense of gratitude and wanting to make amends. The ex isn't asking for it, so it's a generous gesture. The girlfriend's anger might stem from jealousy or feeling that the author is prioritizing the ex over their current relationship. However, the author hasn't done anything illegal or unethical. The decision to give the money seems personal and heartfelt, not malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. She might feel disrespected if the author didn't discuss it with her first, especially given the history of the affair. But the author's reasoning is about family and past commitments. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action isn't against any law or clear moral wrong, and it's intended to help the ex and kids, the answer might be B. But maybe there's a point about respecting the girlfriend's feelings. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing, not the girlfriend's reaction. The author isn't obligated to consult the girlfriend, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
