I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife. His ex-wife is portrayed as gracious, allowing him to stay involved with the kids and keeping the divorce as painless as possible. Now, he wants to give her a significant sum from his lottery win to show appreciation and help her out. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he still loves his ex-wife.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he's trying to make amends and show gratitude. The ex-wife worked hard for the kids and supported him despite the pain. The money could improve her life and help the kids. His intentions are noble\u2014recognition of her sacrifices and providing some financial security.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected. She might feel that giving money to an ex-wife, especially the mother of his children, could imply lingering feelings or a betrayal of their current relationship. Relationships often have boundaries, and not discussing such a major decision with the partner can lead to hurt feelings, even if the intentions are good.\n\nBut the key points here are: the author isn't in love with his ex-wife anymore; it's about appreciation and the kids. He hasn't talked to the ex-wife yet, and the lawyer is on board, so there's no legal issue. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's actions are driven by a sense of gratitude and responsibility towards his children's mother. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intentions versus the impact. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of giving a large sum to an ex without consulting the current partner might be seen as insensitive. However, the ex-wife's role as a mother and the support she provided post-divorce might justify the gesture. \n\nThe author isn't legally bound to his ex-wife anymore, but morally, he feels it's right. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings of being sidelined in a significant decision. It's a classic case of differing values where both parties might have valid points. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his actions stem from a place of gratitude and a desire to support his children's mother. However, the way he communicated (or didn't communicate) with his girlfriend is a problem. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the main issue is the act itself, the answer would lean towards B (No). The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong given the circumstances.\n"
