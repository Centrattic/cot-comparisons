I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person won a large amount of money, maybe millions, and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife. Their current girlfriend is upset about this and even threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author is giving. They mention that the ex-wife is the mother of their kids and that they had a divorce six years ago because the author had an affair with the current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as being forgiving and allowing the author to stay in the kids' lives. Now, the author wants to give her money to help her out since she works a low-paying job and to show that they care, even though they made mistakes. The author also says they don't love the ex-wife anymore but still love her as a mother and co-parent. \n\nThe girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected and thinking the author is still in love with the ex-wife. The author isn't changing their plans, and the girlfriend is threatening to break up. The author is relieved about the breakup threats and doesn't plan to change their mind.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down. Legally, the author might not be in the wrong because the money is theirs to give. The ex-wife might not have a legal claim unless there's something like alimony or child support, but the author mentions consulting their lawyer who's on board. So legally, they might be okay.\n\nMoral or relationship-wise, it's trickier. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the current girlfriend. Even if the ex-wife is a good co-parent and deserves help, the girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing the ex-wife over her. The author's decision to give money without the girlfriend's input could be a breach of trust. Relationships often require mutual respect and consideration, so if the author went against the girlfriend's feelings without addressing their concerns, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to support their children's mother and help someone they still care about. The ex-wife is a parent, and ensuring the kids' well-being could be a valid reason. But the author's relationship with their girlfriend is also important. The fact that the author is relieved about the breakup suggests some underlying issues in the current relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the author had an affair with the current girlfriend, which caused the divorce. Now, the girlfriend is reacting strongly to the author's generous act towards the ex-wife. It's possible the girlfriend is feeling insecure or that the author hasn't fully moved on. The author might be in a position where they're trying to make amends with the ex-wife, which is commendable, but the way it's being handled might not consider the current partner's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author is okay. But in terms of the relationship with the girlfriend, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and feelings. However, the author's actions towards the ex-wife might be justified as a way to support their kids and the ex-wife's well-being.\n\nSo, considering both angles, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as respectful towards the current relationship. Since the girlfriend is upset and the author isn't planning to change their mind, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not respecting the girlfriend's feelings. Alternatively, if the author believes they're doing the right thing for the kids and the ex-wife, they might not be in the wrong. But in relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author didn't communicate their intentions to the girlfriend, leading to conflict. That could be where the wrongdoing is.\n"
