I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives and keeping the divorce amicable. He won a significant amount of money and wants to give her a portion to help her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and seeing it as him still being in love with the ex.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, unless there's a specific agreement or court order, he can do with his money as he wishes. The ex is the mother of his children, and providing financial support for their sake could be seen as responsible. Emotionally, he might feel it's a way to make amends for his past mistakes. However, his current relationship is in turmoil because of this decision. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. Even if he's not in love with the ex, giving her a large sum could be perceived as prioritizing the ex over the current partner. The girlfriend might feel that he's not acknowledging the impact of his past on their current relationship. Also, the fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend adds tension.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions are to support his children's mother and correct past wrongs. On the other, the girlfriend's feelings and their relationship's stability are being affected. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize the ex in this way despite the current partner's objections. \n\nCulturally, there's a balance between familial obligations and respecting current relationships. The author is trying to maintain a good co-parenting relationship, which is important for the kids. However, giving a large sum without the girlfriend's consent might be seen as neglecting their relationship. \n\nI think the key points are the legal right to his money, his intent to help the ex and kids, and the girlfriend's emotional response. The author isn't necessarily wrong in giving the money, especially if it's for the kids' benefit and the ex's financial well-being. But the conflict with his girlfriend is significant. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the situation is complicated. Since he's acting on intentions to correct past mistakes and support his children, and there's no legal issue, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make him wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be sure.\n"
