I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to their ex-wife. The ex is the mother of their kids, and they divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex is portrayed as a good person who's been supportive post-divorce.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving the money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. The author feels it's a way to show appreciation and support, especially since the ex works a low-paying job and the money could help her and the kids. His parents, lawyer, and he himself agree it's a good idea. The girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her or still in love with the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the money is his to give (like a lottery win, not part of shared assets), then he's probably within his rights to give it to whomever he wants. However, if there are legal obligations from the divorce regarding child support or alimony, giving money to the ex could affect that. The author mentions consulting his lawyer, who was surprised but on board, so maybe the lawyer confirmed it's legal.\n\nEmotionally, the ex is a good co-parent, and the author feels it's a way to make amends. The ex's reaction to the win was positive, just a joke about taking the kids on a trip. The author isn't in love with the ex anymore, just loves her as a mother and co-parent. The girlfriend's anger is based on jealousy or feeling disrespected, which is understandable but might be unfounded if the author isn't in a relationship with the ex.\n\nBut the girlfriend is in a relationship with the author now, and giving money to an ex, especially the mother of his children, could be seen as insensitive to her. However, the author's intention is to support the kids and the ex, which is a separate issue from the current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be about her own insecurities or feeling that the ex is being prioritized over her.\n\nThe author's relief at the threats to break up could indicate that the relationship is strained, but that's not directly relevant to the main question of right or wrong. The key points are: the money is his to give, the ex is deserving, and the action is for the kids' and ex's benefit. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's acting in good faith and with legal approval.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a personal choice to support his ex and children, which is separate from his current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but doesn't make the author wrong.\n"
