I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the context: the author won a substantial amount of money. He's considering giving a significant portion to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his two children. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a good person who handled the divorce amicably, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives. The author feels he wants to give her the money as a gesture of respect and to help her, since her job doesn't pay well. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with his ex.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's intentions and the legal/ethical considerations. The author's reasons include wanting to support his children's mother, recognizing her sacrifices, and helping her financially. He's also considering his parents' and lawyer's approval. However, the girlfriend's reaction is a significant factor here. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give, then he might have the right to do so. However, ethically, there's a question about whether this is appropriate given their past relationship. The author is not in love with the ex-wife, but still loves her as a mother and wants to show care. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel he's prioritizing his ex over her, especially since he cheated on his ex with her. \n\nBut the author did have a past mistake (the affair) and now wants to make amends in a way that benefits both his children and ex-wife. The ex-wife is supportive of the kids and handled the divorce well. The author's main motivation seems to be genuine care for his children and ex, but this could be perceived as favoritism or a breach of trust by the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that her feelings and their relationship are being disregarded. The author hasn't discussed this with his ex-wife yet, but his intentions are clear. The legal and parental support suggests he's within his rights. However, emotionally, it's a sensitive situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author's intentions are purely to support his children and ex-wife, and he's not engaging in any romantic involvement, then legally he's not wrong. But emotionally, he might have neglected his girlfriend's feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is justified in her anger. Since he's acting on his own money and with good intentions, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But there's a consideration of respect towards his current partner. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is part of his family now, maybe he should have discussed it with her. But he didn't, and that's a problem. However, the question is about whether he is in the wrong. The key factors are his intentions and the fact that he's acting in a way that's legally permissible and for the benefit of his children. The answer might swing towards 'not in the wrong' because of his genuine intentions and the legal support, but some might argue he's disrespecting his current relationship. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the impact on others. Here, the author's actions are aimed at supporting his ex-wife and kids, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but the author hasn't done anything legally or ethically wrong in terms of his obligations. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
