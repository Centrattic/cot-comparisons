I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife after a lottery win is in the wrong, especially since their current girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the person's reasoning: the ex-wife is the mother of their two children, and they had a divorce six years ago due to the author's affair with their current partner. The ex-wife is portrayed as having handled the divorce gracefully, allowing co-parenting despite the pain. The author feels a sense of guilt and wants to make amends by providing financial support, considering her current job pays poorly. They've consulted their parents and a lawyer, who supported the decision. The girlfriend reacts angrily, feeling disrespected and accused the author of still loving the ex-wife. The author clarifies they don't love the ex-wife anymore but still care about her as a co-parent and mother.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's intentions are to right a past wrong and ensure their children's well-being. The ex-wife is in a better position to benefit from the money, given her financial situation. The author isn't obligated to share the money, but their motivation is to do the right thing by their children and former spouse. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, possibly feeling neglected or unappreciated, but the author isn't under any legal obligation to consult her. The key points are the children's well-being, the ex-wife's deserving nature, and the author's good intentions. The girlfriend's reaction highlights possible emotional neglect, but the author isn't in the wrong for making this decision based on the provided context. So, the answer would be B.\n"
