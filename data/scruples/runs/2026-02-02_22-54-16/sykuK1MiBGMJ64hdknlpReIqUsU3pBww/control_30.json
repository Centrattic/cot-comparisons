I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which his current girlfriend is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and they divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. He mentions that his ex-wife was a saint during the divorce, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives despite the pain. She works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her out financially. He also says he still loves her but isn't in love anymore.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex. The author says he's not in love with the ex but feels he owes her and wants to support their kids. He hasn't discussed it with the ex yet but has talked to his parents and lawyer, who support him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, giving money to an ex can be tricky. But in this case, he's doing it for the kids' sake and because he wants to make amends for his past mistakes. The ex is a good co-parent and deserves some support. His girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, but her being his ex and the mother of his children, maybe it's reasonable. However, he should consider the implications on his current relationship. The girlfriend might feel he's prioritizing his ex over their relationship. The author's intentions seem genuine, but the action could be seen as crossing boundaries. But since he's not in love with her anymore, maybe it's okay. The key points are the children's well-being and the ex's financial situation. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting out of love for his kids and guilt from his past mistake. However, not consulting his girlfriend might be a problem, but she's not the legal guardian of the kids. The lawyer's approval suggests it's legally okay. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
