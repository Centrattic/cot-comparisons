I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won, despite their girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from their ex-wife. The ex-wife is described as being a saint, allowing the divorce to be amicable and still co-parenting well. The author feels a sense of guilt and wants to make amends by giving her a significant portion of their lottery winnings. They consulted their parents and lawyer, who supported the idea. However, the girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking the author is still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, the key points: The ex-wife is the mother of the kids, and the author wants to support her financially as a way to show care and help their children. The girlfriend feels betrayed. Legally, if the money is the author's to give, they might have the right. Emotionally, it's about respecting past relationships and current partners.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to make things right with the ex-wife for past mistakes, which is understandable. The ex-wife seems to accept it gracefully. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. But since the author is not in love with the ex-wife anymore and it's about the kids and supporting their mother, maybe it's justified. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter too. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not breaking the law and the ex agreed to the divorce terms, perhaps he isn't. But maybe he should consider the girlfriend's perspective more. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are good and it's about family.\n"
