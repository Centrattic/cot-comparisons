I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person won a large sum of money, around millions. They want to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who is the mother of their two kids. They divorced six years ago because the author had an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife was hurt but handled the divorce amicably. Now, the author wants to give her money to help her out, as she works a low-paying job and can't afford to pursue her hobbies. The author's parents and lawyer support this, but the current girlfriend is furious, thinking the author is still in love with the ex. The author hasn't told the ex yet but is going ahead with the plan despite the girlfriend's anger.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author is giving money to an ex-spouse who is a co-parent. The ex is described as having been gracious during the divorce, allowing contact with the kids, and being respectful. The author's intention is to show appreciation for her past support and to help her financially. The current partner is upset, feeling disrespected and jealous. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel it's their right to decide what to do with their own money, especially since the ex-wife is the mother of their children. They might also feel a sense of responsibility or gratitude towards the ex for being a good co-parent. The ex's financial situation is mentioned as poor, so helping her could be seen as altruistic.\n\nOn the other hand, the current partner's reaction is valid. The author giving such a large sum might be seen as a betrayal or a sign that they still have feelings for the ex. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing the ex's needs over their current relationship. The author didn't discuss the decision with the girlfriend, which could be a point of contention. \n\nLegally, the author can give the money if it's their own. However, relationship-wise, the lack of communication with the current partner is a problem. The girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected are important. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the girlfriend might feel that the gesture undermines their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author made the decision without consulting the current partner, which is a breach of trust. Even if the intention is good, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's part of the current relationship. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but relationship-wise, they're causing harm by not considering the partner's feelings. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might hinge on the relationship aspect. The author could be in the wrong for not discussing the decision with the partner first, even if the act itself isn't illegal. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, and the author's action could be seen as prioritizing past commitments over the current relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from a relationship ethics standpoint, even if not legally.\n"
