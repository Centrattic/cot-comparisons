I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His current girlfriend is upset about this. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is portrayed as being very generous and kind, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives despite the pain. The author still has feelings of love and respect for her, especially since she's the mother of his children. He wants to give her money to show he's not a complete mess and to help her with her financial situation since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this decision, but his girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and possibly thinking he's still in love with his ex-wife.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider here are:\n\n1. **Intentions**: The author's stated intentions are to acknowledge his ex-wife's role as the mother of his children, help her financially, and show he cares despite his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support this, which might indicate that the decision is well-considered.\n\n2. **Financial Responsibility**: The money is his to give, as he won it. He's not legally obligated to give it to anyone, so from a legal standpoint, he's within his rights.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact on the Current Relationship**: The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected, and believes he's still in love with his ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with her but still loves her for being a good co-parent and mother. However, the girlfriend might see this as a betrayal or a lack of commitment to the current relationship.\n\n4. **Communication**: The author hasn't discussed the money with his ex-wife yet, but he has told his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that there might be a communication gap in their relationship. The fact that the author is \"feeling incredibly relieved\" by her breakup threats might indicate he's not fully considering her feelings or the potential consequences.\n\n5. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Giving money to a former spouse can be a sensitive issue, especially when in a new relationship. While the author's motivations are positive, the girlfriend might perceive it as an imbalance in how he's handling his relationships and financial decisions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Legally, he's not wrong. Morally, it depends on the context of his relationship with his ex and current girlfriend. However, the fact that his girlfriend is so upset and he's considering going through with it despite her feelings might make it a matter of poor judgment rather than being outright wrong. The author's relief at her threats could suggest he's prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are noble and legally sound, the impact on his current relationship could be a point where he's in the wrong from a relational perspective. However, if the focus is solely on whether he's obligated to give the money or if it's his to give, then he's not in the wrong. But considering the emotional impact and communication issues, there's a case to be made that his actions could be seen as inconsiderate towards his girlfriend.\n"
