I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, especially since his girlfriend is angry about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is described as amazing, and the author feels a sense of guilt over the affair. He wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery money as a way to show he cares and to help her and their kids. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected, and threatening to break up.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong to give money to his ex-wife. Let's break down the factors. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and she's been cooperative in co-parenting despite the divorce. The author is trying to make amends for his past mistakes. On the other hand, the girlfriend is his current partner, and she's upset that he's giving money to his ex. \n\nLegally, since the author is divorced, he isn't obligated to provide for his ex-wife unless there are specific alimony terms. But this is a personal gesture, not alimony. The author has discussed the plan with his parents and a lawyer, who are on board. That suggests the action is within legal boundaries.\n\nEmotionally, the girlfriend might feel that this gesture shows lingering attachment to the ex-wife, even if the author isn't in love with her anymore. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might perceive this as a breach of commitment. However, the author's intention is to support his children and acknowledge his ex-wife's sacrifices, which is a separate matter.\n\nMoral judgment can be subjective here. If the author is using his money freely and the ex-wife is accepting it, then it's a personal choice. The author isn't legally bound to give the money, and if he feels it's the right thing to do for his kids and to make amends, some would say it's not his fault. However, considering the girlfriend's feelings is important. The author might have done better to communicate more and ensure his actions don't inadvertently hurt his current partner, even if his intentions are good.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the action is his decision and not legally or morally wrong, but it's causing conflict in his relationship, it's a matter of perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is about how she feels, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to make amends. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance that he could have handled the communication better to consider his girlfriend's feelings more.\n"
