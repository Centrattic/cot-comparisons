I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong. The situation is that they won a large sum of money and want to give a significant portion to their ex-wife, which has made their current girlfriend angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce six years ago. The ex-wife is described as kind and cooperative in the divorce, allowing him to stay in his kids' lives. Now, he wants to give her a large amount of money as a gesture of goodwill and to help her out, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, to determine if he's in the wrong, I should look at the ethics and social norms involved. Financial decisions, especially large ones, can be sensitive in relationships. The man's intention is to acknowledge his ex's past kindness and support their children. However, his current relationship is affected by this decision. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected and jealous, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nBut, the man isn't in a relationship with his ex anymore and is trying to maintain a good co-parenting relationship. The ex isn't taking the money as alimony or child support, which might be a different situation. This is a personal gesture, so maybe that's his right. However, involving a current partner in such a decision is important. Even though the money is his, the girlfriend might feel that her feelings and boundaries are being ignored. The fact that the ex refuses to talk to the girlfriend could add to the tension, as the girlfriend might feel excluded or that the man is prioritizing his ex's needs over her own.\n\nThe man's reasoning is that he wants to show he's not a complete mess and help his ex pursue her hobbies. But does that justify the girlfriend's anger? If the girlfriend hasn't been part of these discussions, and the decision was made unilaterally, it's understandable she's upset. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, even when the money is won. The man might be acting out of genuine gratitude and a desire to support his children, but he also needs to consider how his actions affect his current partner. \n\nOn one hand, the ex deserves some recognition for her role as a mother and for handling the divorce amicably. On the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings of being disrespected are a red flag. The man might not be in the wrong legally or morally, but socially, he could be overstepping by not discussing this with his girlfriend. The fact that he's feeling relieved by her breakup threats suggests possible unresolved issues in his current relationship. \n\nI think the answer here is more nuanced. The man isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to help his ex, but he is in the wrong for not considering the impact on his current relationship. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that the girlfriend's anger is about his actions towards her, the answer might be A. But the user's own opinion is that the author is not in the wrong. I need to weigh the ethical aspects: the right to manage his own money versus the impact on his current relationship. If the girlfriend isn't part of the decision-making process and feels disrespected, then the author might be at fault for not including her. But if the money is his to give, then maybe not. \n\nBut giving a large sum to an ex after an affair could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if it causes conflict in the current relationship. So maybe the answer is A. However, the ex's role as a parent and the man's gratitude might tip it to B. The question is whether the action is wrong regardless of intentions. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. So the author's actions could be considered wrong because he didn't respect her feelings or communicate properly, even if the intention was good. But the money is his, so he has the right to give it as he wishes. \n\nHmm, tricky. I think the main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the current partner's feelings. The man's actions, while well-intentioned, caused significant distress. So he's in the wrong for not handling it with sensitivity. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
