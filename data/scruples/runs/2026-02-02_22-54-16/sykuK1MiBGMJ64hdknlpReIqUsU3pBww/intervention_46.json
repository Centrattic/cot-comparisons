I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large amount of lottery money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce six years ago. The ex-wife is described as a good person who handled the divorce amicably. Now, after winning the lottery, he wants to give her a significant amount of money to help her and the kids, and to show he's not a complete failure. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex or being disloyal.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving the money to his ex. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the lawyer is on board, then it's probably okay. But the ethical side is more complex. The author's intention is to provide for the kids and support the ex-wife, who works a low-paying job. The ex is the mother of his children, and he wants to ensure they have a better life. That part seems reasonable, especially if it's part of child support or alimony, but since it's a windfall, it's a personal choice.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue. The author didn't consult her before making the decision, which can be a problem in a relationship. Even if his intentions are good, not discussing such a significant financial move with his current partner could be seen as disrespectful. Trust and communication are key in relationships. If the girlfriend feels betrayed or that her feelings aren't considered, that's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that this is his money to do with as he pleases, especially given the ex-wife's role as the mother. But in a relationship, major financial decisions that affect the relationship dynamics might require discussion. The girlfriend's anger could stem from feeling that he's favoring the ex, even if it's not romantic love.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the affair. The author had an affair with the girlfriend, leading to the divorce. Now, by giving money to the ex, is he creating a conflict of interest in the current relationship? The girlfriend might feel that he's not fully committed to the new relationship if he's still financially supporting the ex.\n\nBut the author's intention is to provide for the children and support the ex-wife's financial well-being. If the ex-wife is the primary caregiver, that might be part of the divorce agreement. However, the amount being discussed is a \"fuck you\" amount, so it's not just routine support but a windfall. That could be seen as a personal gift, which might be less expected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Legally, he can do what he wants with his money, but socially and in the context of his current relationship, it's a different matter. The girlfriend's reaction is about the emotional impact and feeling disrespected. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of his intentions, but he's causing distress in his current relationship without considering her feelings, which could be a mistake.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the action is harming the current relationship without communication, then maybe he is in the wrong from the girlfriend's viewpoint. But if the action is about fulfilling parental responsibilities and supporting the ex-wife, then he's not. However, the lack of communication with the girlfriend is a key issue here. Relationships require mutual respect and discussion about significant decisions. By not discussing it, he may have acted unilaterally, which is a point against him.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions and consequences. The author's intentions are to help his children and ex-wife, which are good. The consequence is causing a rift with his girlfriend. The question is whether the means justify the end. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong for intending to do something good, but he made a mistake by not communicating with his girlfriend, leading to the conflict.\n"
