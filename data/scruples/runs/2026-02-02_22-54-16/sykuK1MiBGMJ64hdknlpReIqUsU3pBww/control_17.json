I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery win. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but he says he's not. He still loves his ex for being a good mother and co-parent, and wants to give her the money to help her and the kids. His parents and lawyer support him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and they have a good co-parenting relationship. He's giving her money as a gesture of appreciation and to help her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. His intentions seem genuine, based on his explanation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels disrespected. Even if he's not in love with the ex, giving a significant amount of money might make her feel insecure or think he's still emotionally attached. But the author is clear that he's not in love, just grateful for her role in their kids' lives.\n\nThe key points are: the ex's role as a mother, the author's genuine intentions, the support from his parents and lawyer, and the girlfriend's reaction based on insecurity. The author hasn't broken any laws or done something unethical. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's actions are motivated by a desire to do right by his children and ex-wife.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here. Giving a large sum of money without discussing it with his current partner might be seen as a lack of respect for their relationship. Even if he's not in love with the ex, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. But from a legal standpoint, unless there's a contract or something, the author can give the money. Emotionally, though, maybe the author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more before making such a big decision.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The ex-wife is part of his children's lives, and supporting her could be seen as responsible. The girlfriend's anger is more about the relationship dynamics. The author's actions might be justified based on his reasoning, but the girlfriend's feelings are important too. However, the author hasn't done anything legally wrong, and his reasons are heartfelt. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's a balance between respecting his ex and respecting his current partner. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are good and he's supporting his children's mother. The girlfriend's reaction is more about their relationship issues rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong.\n"
