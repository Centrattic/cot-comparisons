I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The author won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, which led to his girlfriend being angry.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. His ex-wife is a good co-parent, and he wants to give her money to help her out. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore but still cares for the kids and his ex's well-being.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author's decision to give money to his ex might be seen as a gesture of goodwill, especially since the ex-wife was gracious during the divorce. However, the girlfriend might feel it's a betrayal, especially since they are in a relationship. The ex is not part of his current life, but the girlfriend is his current partner. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making this decision, which could be a point of contention.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to make amends for past mistakes and help his ex-wife. But from the girlfriend's side, it might seem like he's prioritizing his ex over her. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but is that a valid reason to say the author is in the wrong? \n\nLegally and ethically, the author can give the money if he's not under any legal obligation not to. The problem is more about the relationship dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong for making a personal decision, but the way he handled it could have been better by discussing it with his girlfriend first. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if he's not in love with the ex anymore. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified from a moral standpoint (helping his ex-wife and kids), but the conflict arises from the current relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author isn't obligated to consult her on this. The key is whether the action itself is wrong, not the girlfriend's reaction. Since the author isn't violating any laws or clear moral duties, he might not be in the wrong. But there's a relational aspect here that's subjective. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't ethically obligated to his girlfriend regarding this decision, and his intentions seem genuine. The girlfriend's anger is a relationship issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to support his ex-wife and children.\n"
