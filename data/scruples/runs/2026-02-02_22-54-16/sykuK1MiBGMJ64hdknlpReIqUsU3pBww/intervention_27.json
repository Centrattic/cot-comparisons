I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to their ex-wife despite their girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from the ex-wife. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing the man to stay in his kids' lives and moving on. The author wants to give her a significant portion of his lottery winnings, partly as a way to show he cares despite his past mistake.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with the ex. The author clarifies he's not in love with her anymore but loves her for being a good co-parent and mother. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Legally, if they're divorced, he might have no obligation, but emotionally, it's a different story. The ex is the mother of his children, and the author wants to provide for them. But the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. \n\nIs it wrong to give the money? Well, he's not obligated to the ex, but he's making a personal choice. The girlfriend's feelings matter too. However, the ex is the mother of his kids, so providing for them is a separate issue from the relationship with the girlfriend. \n\nThe author's intentions seem genuine. He's trying to make amends for past mistakes. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but she might not have a legal claim to his money. However, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which is a misstep. But the act itself\u2014helping the mother of his children\u2014might not be wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to support his children's mother, even if the girlfriend is upset. The key is that he's providing for his kids and acknowledging the ex's sacrifices. The girlfriend's feelings are valid but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong.\n"
