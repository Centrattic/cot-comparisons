I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a good person who allowed a painless divorce, even though she's still hurt. The author feels a sense of responsibility and wants to make up for his past mistakes by helping her financially. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious and threatening to break up.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is choosing to give money to his ex-wife, who he still loves in a parental sense for the kids. He's not in love with her anymore, but he wants to help her out. The girlfriend feels disrespected because he's prioritizing his ex-wife. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give, he can decide how to use it. However, emotionally, the girlfriend might see this as favoring his ex-wife over her. The author's intentions are noble\u2014he wants to support his ex-wife and kids. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel insecure or neglected if he gives money to his ex instead of investing in their future together. \n\nThe author hasn't consulted his girlfriend, which could be an issue. Communication is key in relationships, and making such a big decision without discussing it with her might have contributed to her anger. However, the author's reasoning is about making amends with his ex-wife and helping their children, which are his parental responsibilities. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If he's using his own money and not violating any legal agreements (like alimony or child support, which aren't mentioned here), then technically, he's not wrong. But relationship-wise, not considering his girlfriend's feelings could be a problem. However, the question is whether he's morally wrong. Since his actions are driven by a desire to correct past wrongs and support his children, it's a personal choice that might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction shows that this decision affects their relationship. If he goes through with it despite her objections, it might lead to a breakup. But whether he's \"in the wrong\" is subjective. Some might argue that he's being considerate to his ex-wife and kids, while others think he's being unfair to his current partner. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's using his resources to help those he's responsible for. However, the lack of communication with his girlfriend could be a point of contention. But based on the information given, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
