I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger. The situation is complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author's motivations. He won a significant amount of money and wants to give a portion to his ex-wife, who he feels has been a saint after the divorce. He mentions that she's the mother of his kids and he wants to show he's not a complete failure. He also notes that she works a low-paying job and this money could help her. His parents and lawyer support the idea. The key here is his intent: he's not giving her money to reconnect romantically but as a gesture of gratitude and to support their children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of still loving his ex. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or a feeling of being disrespected. The author, however, clarifies he's not in love with his ex anymore, just appreciative. \n\nLegally, if the money was won by him, he can choose to give it away as he pleases unless there are court restrictions. Since he consulted his lawyer and the lawyer is on board, there's no legal issue. The main conflict is emotional between him and his girlfriend.\n\nThe question is whether his action is morally wrong. The author isn't obligated to give money to his ex-wife, but he's choosing to do so as a gesture of care, especially for the children. His ex-wife, being a co-parent, has a legitimate claim to his resources in terms of child support, but the author is going beyond that. The girlfriend's feelings are important, but the author's decision is based on his past relationship and family considerations.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem justified from his perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might be valid in the context of their relationship dynamics, but the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to help his ex-wife in this way. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
