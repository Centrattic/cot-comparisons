I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to their ex-wife. The ex-wife is the mother of their kids, and they divorced because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex is described as a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things civil. The current girlfriend is furious, seeing this as disrespectful and thinking he's still in love with the ex.\n\nFirst, the ethical angle. The author did wrong by cheating, but now he wants to make amends by supporting the kids' mother financially. The ex works a low-paying job, so this money could help her and the kids. However, the current relationship is a new context. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly insecure. The author hasn't consulted her, which is a problem in a relationship. Financial decisions, especially large ones involving an ex, can strain a new partner's trust.\n\nBut the author's intention is to acknowledge past mistakes and support his children's mother. The ex's behavior post-divorce is commendable. However, in a new relationship, such a decision without discussion could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's anger might be valid because it affects their relationship. The author might be in a position where he's trying to do right by his kids and ex, but neglecting the new relationship's dynamics.\n\nOn one hand, supporting the kids' mother is noble. On the other, the girlfriend's feelings are legitimate. The author's decision to proceed without her input could be seen as a breach of trust. So, while the intent is good, the action might be inconsiderate from the girlfriend's perspective. The answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) being on the author's side because he's not considering the impact on his current partner.\n"
