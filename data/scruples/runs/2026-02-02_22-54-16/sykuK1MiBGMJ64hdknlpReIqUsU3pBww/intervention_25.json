I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money they won from the lottery. Their girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author divorced their ex-wife six years ago due to an affair with the current girlfriend. The ex-wife was very understanding during the divorce, allowing the author to stay close to the kids and keep things peaceful. The author feels guilty for the affair and wants to make amends by giving her money. The ex works a low-paying job, so this could help her financially. The author hasn't talked to the ex yet but has discussed it with parents and a lawyer who are okay with it.\n\nThe girlfriend is angry, thinking the author is disrespecting her and still in love with the ex. The author clarifies they don't love the ex anymore but still care for her as a mother and co-parent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nI need to think about the ethics of giving money to an ex. The author's intention seems genuine: to help the ex and the kids. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because this could feel like a betrayal. The author didn't consult the girlfriend, which can be seen as dismissive. But the author hasn't done anything illegal or necessarily unethical. The money is theirs to give, and the ex is a mother of their children. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a right to feel hurt if she perceives this as the author still being emotionally involved with the ex. The author should have communicated better before making such a big decision. But since the money is a windfall, the author isn't obligated to share it. However, the way it's handled could affect their current relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They might not be legally wrong, but ethically, maybe they should have discussed it with their girlfriend. But the intentions are good, and the ex is a parent involved in their children's lives. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered respectful and thoughtful. Given the details, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of a desire to help and have family support. But the way they handled the communication with their girlfriend could be an issue. Still, the core action of giving the money might not be wrong.\n"
