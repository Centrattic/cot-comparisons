I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to their ex-wife despite their girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author won a significant amount of money, and they want to give a portion to their ex-wife. They were married for a while, have kids together, and the divorce happened because of the author's affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as supportive post-divorce, allowing the author to stay involved with the kids and being respectful despite the pain caused.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex-wife deserves this, maybe as a way to show gratitude and support, especially since she works a low-paying job. The lawyer and parents agree, but the girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking the author is still in love with the ex. The author clarifies they're not in love but still have love and respect for the ex.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nPossible angles to consider: \n1. The moral obligation towards the ex-wife vs. the current relationship.\n2. Whether the ex-wife is a legitimate recipient of such a gift, given their history.\n3. The girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship.\n4. Legal aspects (since the lawyer is on board, maybe the gift doesn't infringe on any legal rights).\n5. The author's emotional state and motivations\u2014repentance, gratitude, or lingering attachment.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be reconciliation through support, not romantic rekindling. The ex-wife is a co-parent and the mother of their children. Financial support for the kids' benefit could be seen as responsible. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid as she might feel overshadowed or disrespected. The author's decision could be seen as commendable for taking responsibility, but the manner of handling it (without considering the girlfriend's feelings) might be problematic.\n\nBut since the author hasn't consulted the ex-wife yet, maybe the ex-wife hasn't agreed to accept the money. Also, the girlfriend's threat to break up is a significant consequence. However, the author mentions they're relieved by her threats, which suggests existing relationship issues. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a subjective matter. Legally, there's no wrong if the lawyer approves. Morally, it's about the author's sense of duty to their ex-wife and children versus their current partner's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent is genuine and the action doesn't breach any agreements. However, the way it's handled could be seen as insensitive to the girlfriend's perspective. But since the ex-wife is the mother of their kids and the author's intention is to support them, it's a complex case. \n\nThe answer could hinge on whether giving the money is a personal choice the author has the right to make, especially regarding their children's well-being, regardless of the girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong (B), as their action is driven by a sense of responsibility to their children and former spouse, even if it causes conflict in their current relationship.\n"
