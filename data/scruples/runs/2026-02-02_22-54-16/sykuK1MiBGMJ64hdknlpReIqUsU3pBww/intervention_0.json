I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, which is causing conflict with his current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and they divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current partner. He acknowledges his mistake, and the ex-wife has been a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things amicable. She works a low-paying job, so giving her money could help her. The author feels he wants to show her he cares, even though he's not in love with her anymore. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex, but he denies that. The girlfriend is threatening to break up, and he's relieved by that.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the moral and ethical implications. Is it right to give money to an ex-spouse without consulting the current partner? Well, the author hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet, but he did talk to his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and possibly insecure. But the author's intention is to do something he thinks is right for his kids' mother, not out of romantic feelings. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that it's his money to do with as he pleases, especially since it's for the benefit of his children and to help his ex-wife. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that this decision affects their relationship and that he should have discussed it with her first. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the author has no legal or prior agreements that restrict him from giving money to his ex, then he's within his rights. Emotionally, though, the girlfriend might feel betrayed even if the reason is noble. But does that make him wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nHe's not being unfaithful; he's giving money to his ex for practical reasons. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, but the author isn't being disloyal. His intention isn't to hurt his girlfriend, but he might not have considered her feelings fully. However, since the money is his and the action is meant to benefit his children and ex-wife, it's hard to say he's entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting out of a sense of responsibility towards his children and to show appreciation to his ex-wife, not out of deceit or malice.\n"
