I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, even though his girlfriend is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. The ex-wife is described as saintly, allowing him to stay close to the kids despite the pain. He wants to give her money to help her out, showing he still cares. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still loves the ex.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, giving a significant amount to an ex could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the girlfriend feels it's a betrayal. On the other hand, the ex is the mother of his kids, and he's trying to make amends for his past mistakes. The ex is in a better position to use the money (since she works a low-paying job), and the author is acting out of gratitude and a desire to help.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the current relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, and the author mentions feeling relieved by her threats. This might indicate some unresolved issues in their relationship. However, the author isn't in love with the ex anymore; he just loves her as a mother and for her kindness during the divorce.\n\nI think the key points are the author's intent to make amends for his past, the ex's positive role in his children's lives, and the girlfriend's reaction possibly being more about insecurity or jealousy. The fact that he hasn't discussed it with the ex yet might be a point to consider, but the author's reasons seem genuine. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there are any ethical issues here. Gifting money to an ex after a divorce isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's for practical reasons like helping the kids or the mother. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. It's a complex situation where both the author's intentions and the girlfriend's feelings are factors.\n"
