I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about giving a large sum of money from a lottery win to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to divorce from his ex. The ex is a good co-parent, and the author feels he owes her for the children. He won a significant amount of money and wants to give her a portion as a gesture of appreciation. His girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves his ex. The author isn't in love with the ex anymore but still values her as a mother.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, if the money is his to give, he can probably do so. But ethically? It's a bit tricky. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel slighted. The author's intention is to show appreciation and help his ex, which is understandable, but he might not have considered the emotional impact on his girlfriend.\n\nHe didn't discuss it with her first, which could be seen as a lack of communication. Even though his parents and lawyer support him, the girlfriend's feelings are important in the relationship. The author's reasoning is heartfelt, but the way he's handling it could be hurtful to his current partner. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he should have had that conversation with his girlfriend before making the decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's giving money to his ex without consulting his girlfriend, and she's upset about it, there's a case for AITA in that context. But his reasons are genuine. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because he's acting out of gratitude for his ex's role as a co-parent. But relationships require communication, so maybe he's in the wrong for not being transparent with his girlfriend. Hmm. It's a balance between his intentions and the relational dynamics. I'll need to weigh the ethical considerations here.\n"
