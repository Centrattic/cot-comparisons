I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife has been a saint, allowing continued contact with the kids and handling the divorce amicably. The author feels guilty and wants to show appreciation by giving her a significant sum. His parents and lawyer support the idea, but his girlfriend is furious, interpreting it as the author still being in love with his ex.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the context. He's trying to make amends for past mistakes, showing gratitude towards his ex-wife, who has been supportive. The ex-wife's job is low-paying, and the money would help her pursue hobbies and improve their kids' lives. The author isn't in love with her anymore; he respects her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from jealousy or feeling disrespected. However, the author isn't obligated to consider his girlfriend's feelings in this matter, especially since the money is for his ex-wife's well-being and the children's benefit. The ex-wife deserved the support given her past actions and current situation.\n\nBut there's a potential issue: the author hasn't discussed this with his ex-wife yet. Maybe he should communicate his intentions directly to her first. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for planning to give the money despite his girlfriend's anger. Since his intentions are good and the action is towards a deserving person, it's more about his autonomy to make this choice. The girlfriend's reaction is a relationship issue, but the author isn't wrong in wanting to help his ex-wife as a form of making amends.\n"
