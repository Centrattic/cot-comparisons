I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset about it, feeling disrespected and thinking he's still in love with his ex. The ex is the mother of his kids and has been good about the divorce despite his affair. The author feels he's doing the right thing to show he cares, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is financially supporting the mother of his children, which is a valid reason. He's also acknowledging his past mistakes and trying to make amends. The ex worked a low-paying job, so giving her money could improve her life. His parents and lawyer support him, which adds some legitimacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are important. He should have discussed this with her before making any decisions. Even though he's not in love with his ex, the gesture might come off as giving more importance to her than his current partner. The girlfriend might feel neglected or unappreciated. However, the author is clear that his reasons are about the kids and making amends, not romantic feelings.\n\nThe key points are: the ex is a good co-parent, the money is for the kids' benefit, and the author's intentions are genuine. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author didn't act out of malice. The main issue is communication. He should have talked to his girlfriend first, but his intent isn't to harm their relationship.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He made a decision that affects his current partner without discussing it first, but his reasons are heartfelt and aimed at the children's well-being. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering all factors, the answer might be that he isn't in the wrong (B), but he should communicate better with his girlfriend to address her feelings.\n"
