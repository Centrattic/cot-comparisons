I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the key points: The man had an affair and left his ex-wife, which caused a divorce six years ago. Now he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial part of it to his ex-wife, who he still respects and loves but isn't in a relationship with. His reasoning is to show he's not a complete failure, help her financially, and benefit their kids. His parents and lawyer support him. His girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves his ex-wife.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The man is giving money to the mother of his children, who he acknowledges he wronged. His ex-wife has been cooperative in co-parenting and hasn't held a grudge. The financial help could improve her life and their kids' well-being. His intention seems genuine, from a place of guilt and wanting to make amends. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid emotional response. But does the act of giving money to an ex-wife make him at fault?\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to support an ex-spouse unless there's a court order, but this is a voluntary gesture. Ethically, it's about respecting boundaries and considering the feelings of his current partner. While the ex-wife has a right to the money as a gift, the girlfriend's perspective is that this gesture might be perceived as prioritizing the ex over her, even if that's not the case. The man hasn't done anything legally wrong, and his actions are aimed at making amends for past mistakes. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the man isn't obligated to please her in this matter. Therefore, he isn't in the wrong for acting on his conscience, even if it causes conflict in his current relationship.\n"
