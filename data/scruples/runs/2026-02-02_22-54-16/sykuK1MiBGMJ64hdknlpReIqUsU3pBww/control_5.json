I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is upset about it and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his motives. He says he still loves his ex-wife for being a good co-parent and mother, and he wants to show that he's not a complete mess by helping her financially. She works a low-paying job, so this could improve her life and their kids' lives. He hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet but talked to his parents and lawyer, who support him. His lawyer was surprised but on board, which might mean there's no legal issue.\n\nNow, his girlfriend is furious. She thinks he's disrespecting her and that he's still in love with his ex. He clarifies he's not in love anymore, just loves her as a mother. But the girlfriend's reaction is strong. The author feels relieved about her threats, which is a red flag. Maybe he's not as committed to the relationship as he thought.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to make amends to the mother of his children, which is commendable. On the other hand, giving a large sum of money without discussing it with his current partner is a big decision that affects their relationship. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should involve your partner if you're in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or not trusted in the relationship. Even if the intention is good, not consulting her could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex-wife and his current girlfriend don't get along adds tension. If he gives the ex-wife money now, it might create more conflict between the two women, potentially affecting the children. The author's parents and lawyer are on board, but their perspectives might not consider the emotional impact on the current relationship.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual agreement on major financial decisions are crucial. The author didn't include his girlfriend in this decision, which is a key point. Even if his intentions are noble, the lack of communication with his partner could be seen as the wrong move. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that this is a significant issue in their relationship.\n\nSo, while the author's motives are good, the way he handled the situation\u2014making a big financial decision without consulting his partner\u2014might be where he went wrong. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and the importance of partnership in such decisions.\n"
