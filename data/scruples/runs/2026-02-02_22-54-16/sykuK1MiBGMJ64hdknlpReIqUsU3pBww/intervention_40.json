I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend being angry about it. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won a significant amount of money. They want to give a substantial portion to their ex-wife, who they consider a great co-parent and mother. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, and the author wants to help her and their kids. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that the author still loves the ex-wife. The author's parents and lawyer agree with the plan, but the girlfriend is threatening to break up.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Is it wrong to give money to an ex-spouse after a divorce? 2) Is the author betraying their current girlfriend's trust? 3) Are there legal or moral implications?\n\nThe author mentions that the ex-wife is a good co-parent, and the author still loves her as a parent, not romantically. They want to make things right in some way for the past affair. The girlfriend's anger seems to stem from jealousy and feeling disrespected. \n\nLegally, if the money is their own (from the lottery), they can give it to whomever they want, unless there are specific alimony or child support obligations. The author hasn't mentioned any legal restrictions, and their lawyer supports the idea, so that's probably covered.\n\nMorally, it's more subjective. The author feels it's a way to show they care about the ex-wife and their kids. The ex-wife accepted the money with gratitude. The girlfriend's reaction is based on emotional insecurity. The author's parents support this, which might indicate that the family sees it as a positive gesture.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. If the author had discussed this with her beforehand, maybe they could have found a compromise. However, the author didn't, leading to her feeling disrespected. The author's response to the girlfriend's anger is to feel relieved about the possible breakup, which might suggest a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're trying to do something good for their ex-wife and kids. On the other hand, they didn't consult their current partner, leading to conflict. The key here is whether the author's actions are unjustified. Since the money is theirs, and the ex-wife is a parent to their children, it's not inherently wrong. However, not communicating with the current partner might be a mistake in terms of relationship dynamics, but not necessarily making the author \"in the wrong\" overall.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal decision with their money, especially for the benefit of their children. However, the communication breakdown with the girlfriend is a relationship issue, but that doesn't make the author \"wrong\" in a moral or legal sense. The girlfriend's reaction is more about personal feelings rather than the action itself being unethical.\n"
