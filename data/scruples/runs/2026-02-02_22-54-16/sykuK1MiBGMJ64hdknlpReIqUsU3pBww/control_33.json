I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a portion to his ex-wife, who he divorced 6 years ago. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and he feels guilty about the affair that led to the divorce. He hasn't told his girlfriend yet, but she's upset and threatening to break up. The author is considering going through with it anyway.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The main points are:\n\n1. The author's relationship with his ex-wife is primarily as co-parents. He's giving her money out of gratitude and guilt over the past affair. She's working a low-paying job and could use the money for hobbies and a better life. The ex-wife seems to have handled the divorce amicably, which the author appreciates.\n\n2. His current girlfriend is angry, feeling disrespected and accused of still being in love with the ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with her anymore but still loves her as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction is causing tension.\n\n3. The author's parents and lawyer support the decision, which might add weight to his side. The ex-wife didn't push for the money, but he feels it's a way to make amends.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is trying to do something good for someone who he wronged in the past. His ex-wife's well-being and the kids' benefit are factors. However, giving a large sum of money without discussing it with his current partner could be seen as disrespectful to her. Relationships often require communication and mutual respect, and not involving his girlfriend in this decision might be the issue here.\n\nBut the ex-wife isn't his current partner, so he's not obligated to consider her feelings in the same way. The money isn't for the ex-wife's benefit solely; it's also for the kids. Yet, the girlfriend's hurt feelings are valid because such a large gift could be perceived as favoring the ex-wife over her.\n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong for making this decision without considering his girlfriend's perspective. While his intentions are noble towards the ex-wife and kids, the lack of communication with his current partner might be the root of the problem. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling neglected or disrespected, even if the author's motives are pure.\n\nIn many cases, major financial decisions that affect a partner should be discussed together. So, the author might be in the wrong for not involving his girlfriend, even though his reasons for helping the ex-wife are valid. The ethical dilemma is between past relationships and current commitments.\n"
