I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large sum of money they won, even though their current girlfriend is angry about it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from their ex-wife six years ago. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing continued contact with the kids and keeping the divorce amicable. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large portion to the ex, who works a low-paying job. The ex is happy about the win but hasn't been told yet. The author's parents and lawyer support the idea, but the girlfriend is furious, feeling disrespected and thinking the author is still in love with the ex. The author isn't in love with the ex anymore but still loves her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether giving the ex a large amount of money is wrong, especially considering the girlfriend's reaction. The author's motivation is to show appreciation for the ex's past kindness and to improve their kids' lives. But the girlfriend feels it's disrespectful to her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the ex is the mother of the author's kids, and the author feels a sense of responsibility and gratitude. The ex's positive behavior post-divorce is a factor. On the other hand, the girlfriend is the current partner, and giving away a large sum without her input might be seen as a breach of trust. Money can be a sensitive issue in relationships, and the fact that the author got the girlfriend after the divorce might complicate things.\n\nBut wait, the author hasn't discussed it with the ex yet, only with parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's anger is about being disrespected and feeling that the author is still emotionally tied to the ex. The author clarifies they're not in love anymore, but the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing the ex's financial situation over the girlfriend's feelings and potentially violating some trust in the current relationship.\n\nLegally, if the money is the author's to give, they can do so. The ex's need and the children's well-being are factors. However, relationship-wise, not involving the current partner in such a significant financial decision might be problematic. The girlfriend's threat to break up is a red flag, indicating that this decision is a major issue for her. The author might be in a position where they're trying to make amends with the past, but it's causing present relationship issues.\n\nBut the author's actions are out of genuine gratitude and desire to support the children. The ex's financial situation is poor, and the author feels it's a way to right past wrongs. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that this action shows a lack of respect for her and possibly unresolved feelings. The author's parents and lawyer agree, but that doesn't necessarily mean the girlfriend is wrong in her feelings.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Legally, AITA might not be in the wrong if the funds are theirs to give. Emotionally and relationally, it's more complex. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her feelings aren't considered. The author might be prioritizing their children's well-being and past obligations, which is understandable, but not considering the current partner's perspective.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the balance between past responsibilities and current relationships. The author's decision might be seen as commendable for trying to do the right thing by the ex and kids, but the method of handling it without discussing with the current partner first is where the problem lies. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's part of the current life, and big financial decisions can affect the relationship's stability.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear yes or no. The author is in a tough spot, but not necessarily in the wrong. However, the way they handled the situation (not discussing with the girlfriend) might be the issue. The answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to lean towards the answer based on these considerations.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to support the ex and kids, especially given the circumstances. The main issue is communication with the girlfriend, not the act itself. So the answer would be B (No). But maybe some see it as wrong because of the girlfriend's feelings being disregarded. However, the author's motivation is positive. So B.\n"
