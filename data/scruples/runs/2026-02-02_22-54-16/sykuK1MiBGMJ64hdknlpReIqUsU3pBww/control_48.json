I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife after winning the lottery, which causes conflict with the current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is a good co-parent, and he wants to give her money to help her out because she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support this. The girlfriend is furious, thinks he still loves his ex, and might break up with him. He's considering going through with it anyway.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, since they're divorced, he can give her the money. The lawyer is on board, so that's probably okay. Ethically, it's more complex. He's trying to make amends for his past mistake by helping her, which is positive. But his current partner is upset because she feels disrespected. He's in a relationship now, and this decision affects her. \n\nDoes he have an obligation to his ex-wife? She's the mother of his kids, and they co-parent. Financial support for the kids is common, but giving a large sum to her personally could be seen as a gesture beyond child support. His intention is to show he cares despite past mistakes, which is commendable. However, not discussing this with his current girlfriend first caused conflict. \n\nIs he being unfair to his girlfriend? She's the one in the relationship now. If he made a decision without her input that directly impacts her feelings, maybe he's overstepping. But then again, he's entitled to his money and his feelings towards his ex. \n\nThe line between respecting his ex and respecting his current partner might be blurry here. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but he's not in love with his ex. He's trying to do the right thing by her for the kids and her financial situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's hard to say. Legally, no. Ethically, it depends on the intentions and how it affects his current partner. If the money is for the kids, that's one thing, but giving her a large sum when it's causing his current partner so much distress might be seen as disrespectful to his current relationship. But if the ex is in a difficult position and he wants to help, that's a positive action. \n\nIn the end, it's a personal decision, but he might be causing unnecessary harm to his current partner by not considering her feelings. However, he's not obligated to consult her on how to use his money. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's using his money to help someone who helped him, but the way he handled it might have been poor. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for the action itself, not the handling of the situation. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that giving a large amount to an ex could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a new relationship. But the intentions here are good. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. It's a tough call. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
