I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings. The author got in a situation where after winning millions, he wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, but his girlfriend is furious about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, and the author feels a sense of guilt from the affair that led to the divorce. He wants to show appreciation because she handled the divorce well and is a good co-parent. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her or still in love with the ex.\n\nThe main points to evaluate are: the author's intentions, the context of the ex-wife's situation, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author is trying to make amends for past mistakes, and his ex-wife's job is underpaid. He hasn't actually given the money yet, just made the plan. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or feeling disrespected. However, the author isn't obligated to the ex-wife beyond child support. Giving her money voluntarily isn't illegal, but it's a personal decision that can affect his current relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author is trying to do good by his children's mother and acknowledge his past. However, not involving the girlfriend and the potential for misunderstandings (like her thinking he's still emotionally involved) could be a misstep. But since the author is clear that he's not in love with the ex and the gift is for his kids' well-being and her support, it's hard to say he's wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel disrespected, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to right past wrongs. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
