I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the author won a significant amount of money. He wants to give a substantial part of it to his ex-wife, who's the mother of his kids. The divorce happened six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. He still feels responsible and appreciative of her, especially since she's been a good co-parent. His parents and lawyer support this decision. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of him still loving his ex. The author clarifies he's not in love with his ex but respects her.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The main points are the author's intentions and the legal/ethical aspects. He's providing for his children's mother, which could be seen as a responsible action. His ex works a low-paying job, so helping her financially might allow her to improve her life and better support the kids. The ex was cooperative during the divorce, which adds to the complexity. \n\nBut his girlfriend is his current partner, and he's about to share a large amount with his ex. She might feel he's not being fair or considering her feelings. Even if there's no legal obligation, the emotional aspect is significant. However, the author's rationale is about making amends and supporting his children's upbringing. \n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he might be in the right. But ethically, it's about respect for his partner's feelings. However, his actions are towards his ex, not the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, but the author's reasoning is about family responsibility. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the money is his to give and the ex is a parent, maybe not. But he should have discussed it with his girlfriend beforehand. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions are for his kids and ex's well-being, and he's not legally bound to the girlfriend in this matter. However, the emotional impact on his girlfriend is real, but not necessarily making the author wrong.\n"
