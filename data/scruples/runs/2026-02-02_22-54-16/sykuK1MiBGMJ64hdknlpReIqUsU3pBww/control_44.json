I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person won a large sum of money, around millions. They want to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who's the mother of their kids. They had a divorce six years ago because of an affair with their current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as a saint, handling the divorce amicably and allowing them to see their kids. The author feels guilty about the past and wants to show appreciation through this gift. Their parents and lawyer support this, but their current girlfriend is furious, accusing them of still loving the ex-wife and threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The ex-wife received a portion already through the divorce, right? The author is giving more than that. But the lawyer approved it, so maybe it's legally okay. Then there's the emotional angle. The author still loves the ex for being a good co-parent, which is understandable. They want to help her financially because she works a low-paying job.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected and betrayed. She's the current partner, and suddenly learning about a large gift to an ex might make her feel insecure. The author didn't consult her, which could be a mistake. But the author argues that the ex-wife is the mother of their children, and this is a way to make amends for past mistakes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the ex's actions were more forgiving and generous, while the author is trying to right their past wrongs. However, not involving the current partner in such a significant decision could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel her partner is prioritizing the ex financially, which could affect trust in the current relationship.\n\nBut the author isn't in love with the ex anymore. They're doing this out of respect and guilt. The ex's acceptance of the money and the support from family and lawyer suggest it's a legitimate gesture. However, the girlfriend's feelings are being neglected here. The author should have discussed it with her first to manage expectations and address any concerns.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are a reasonable gesture of appreciation versus a betrayal. Since the money is a personal decision and the ex is their children's mother, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the lack of communication with the current partner is an issue. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just about communication. The author's intentions are good, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. However, the ex's role as a parent and the author's guilt might justify the action. So, probably not in the wrong (B).\n"
