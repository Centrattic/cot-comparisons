I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife. His girlfriend is furious about this and threatening to break up.\n\nFirst, the context: He had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. The ex-wife is now a good co-parent, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things civil. He wants to give her money to help her out, partly as a way to show he cares despite his past mistakes. His parents and lawyer support him, but the girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, he can give the money if he owns it. Emotionally, he's trying to make amends with the ex, which might be seen as a good intention. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel he's prioritizing his ex over their current relationship. But since they've been separated for six years and she's been a good co-parent, maybe it's reasonable. The key points are his intentions and the impact on both parties. He's not in love with the ex anymore, just loves her as a mother. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but maybe it's about insecurity. If the author isn't violating any agreements or being unfair, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But maybe the girlfriend has a right to feel disrespected if he's giving money to an ex without considering her feelings. Hmm. I think the answer might hinge on whether the action is seen as appropriate given the circumstances. Since he's trying to do something good for the ex and the kids, and it's been six years, maybe he's in the right. So, answer B.\n"
