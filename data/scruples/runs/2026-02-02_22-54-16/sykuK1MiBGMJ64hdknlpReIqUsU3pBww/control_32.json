I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. He's divorced for six years, and the ex-wife is a good co-parent. He had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce. Now, he feels a sense of guilt and wants to make amends by helping her financially. The ex-wife works a low-paying job, so this money could help her and their kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset. She feels disrespected and believes he still loves the ex-wife. The author clarifies that he's not in love with her anymore but still loves her as a mother and co-parent. The girlfriend is threatening to break up, and the author feels relieved by this.\n\nLegally, the author's lawyer is on board, so there might not be legal issues. Ethically, it's about whether giving money to an ex is acceptable. The author's intentions are good\u2014supporting the kids and acknowledging the ex's sacrifices. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The author didn't consult her, which could be a problem in their relationship. \n\nThe key points are: the ex is a good mother, the money is to help her and the kids, and the author isn't in a relationship with her anymore. The girlfriend's reaction stems from jealousy and feeling disrespected. The author's decision might be seen as noble, but relationships require mutual respect and communication. However, since he's not obligated to discuss it with his current girlfriend, especially since they're not married, his choice might not be wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on a desire to make amends and support his ex-wife and children. While the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's acting on his own judgment and the ex's needs. The answer is B.\n"
