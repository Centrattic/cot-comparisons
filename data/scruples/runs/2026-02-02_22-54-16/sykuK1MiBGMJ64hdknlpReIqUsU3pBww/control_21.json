I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. Now, he's won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large sum to his ex-wife, the mother of his two kids. His reasons include wanting to show he's not a \"complete fuck up,\" helping her financially (since she works a low-paying job), and allowing their kids to have a better life. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex.\n\nSo, the key points are the financial gift to the ex-wife and the girlfriend's reaction. The author doesn't plan to change his decision. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Legal Aspects**: The author consulted his lawyer, who agreed. If the gift is legal and within their rights, maybe there's no issue. But if there are any legal ties (like alimony, child support, or prior agreements), giving money might complicate things. However, since it's a windfall, not income, maybe it's okay.\n\n2. **Emotional and Relationship Dynamics**: The ex-wife allowed a painless divorce and has been a good co-parent. The author feels he needs to repay her kindness. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The affair was the author's fault, so his current actions might be seen as prioritizing his ex over his current partner.\n\n3. **Intentions vs. Actions**: The author claims he's not in love with his ex but still loves her for co-parenting. However, giving a large sum might be perceived as an emotional gesture. The girlfriend's anger is about feeling disrespected, which is valid in a relationship context.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it ethical to give money to an ex-spouse after a divorce, especially when in a new relationship? It depends on the circumstances. If there's no legal obligation, it's a personal choice. But if it causes conflict in the current relationship, it's a relational issue.\n\n5. **Communication**: The author hasn't told his ex-wife yet but discussed with parents and lawyer. The girlfriend found out and is upset. The author didn't consider her feelings, which could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership.\n\nPutting it all together: The author's intentions are to help his ex-wife and the kids, supported by family and legal advice. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected. The author's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, he's causing conflict in his current relationship. The key is whether the decision to give the money without considering his girlfriend's perspective is wrong. Since relationships require mutual respect and communication, the author might be at fault for not discussing it with his girlfriend first, even if his intentions are good. Alternatively, if the gift is a personal choice and not part of their shared finances, he might not be wrong. But given the girlfriend's reaction and the context, the answer could lean towards Yes (A) because of the impact on the current relationship despite good intentions.\n"
