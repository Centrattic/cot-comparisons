I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a large sum of money to an ex-wife despite the current girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife, who he divorced six years ago. The ex-wife is described as a good mother, and the divorce happened because the author had an affair with his current girlfriend. Now, the girlfriend is upset and threatening to break up over the decision to give money to the ex-wife.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to show his ex that he cares, given her financial situation, and that he's trying to make amends for past mistakes. The girlfriend feels disrespected and believes this action implies the author still loves his ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with her anymore, just respects her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, if the money is his to give (like a lottery win, which is typically sole ownership), there's no legal issue. Ethically, it's more complex. The girlfriend's feelings are valid; giving a large sum to an ex might be seen as a breach of trust or commitment. However, the author's intention is to help his ex-wife and children, which is a compassionate act. The ex-wife accepted the divorce and maintained a good co-parenting relationship, so the author might feel a sense of responsibility towards them.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, possibly because of past betrayal. The author might need to consider her feelings, but if the money is his to give and the ex-wife is a parent to their children, it's not entirely his fault. The situation balances between honoring past relationships and respecting the current partner's boundaries. However, since the money isn't part of joint assets and the ex-wife is a parent, the author isn't necessarily wrong in choosing to help her. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's actions are based on his own values and history. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
