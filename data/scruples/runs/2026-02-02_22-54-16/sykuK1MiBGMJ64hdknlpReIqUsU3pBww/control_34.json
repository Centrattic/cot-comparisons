I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong after giving their ex a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation. The person had an affair with their current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from their ex-wife. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing contact with the kids and handling the divorce amicably. The person wants to give money to the ex to compensate for the affair and support the kids. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and accused of the person still loving the ex.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons for the money. The person mentions wanting to show care for the ex, who works a low-paying job, and to give the kids a better life. They also involve their parents and lawyer, who agree. The ex was happy about the news but the girlfriend is furious.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The person is trying to make amends with their ex, which might be understandable given the circumstances. However, the girlfriend wasn't part of this decision, and sudden large financial commitments can be a point of conflict in relationships. The person's actions might be seen as neglecting their current partner's feelings, but also as trying to right past wrongs.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the person is within their rights to give money to an ex, especially for the children's sake, maybe they aren't wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels betrayed and the action is causing significant relationship distress without her consent, there might be an issue. But the person hasn't actually given the money yet, just planned to. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the person's intentions are to support their children and ex. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The person isn't legally obligated to give the ex money, but morally they might feel it's right. However, not discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as dismissive. But the ex's well-being and the kids' is also important. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong because they're trying to do something good for their family, even if the girlfriend is upset. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether the action is optimal. Since the person isn't forced to give the money and is trying to make amends, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
