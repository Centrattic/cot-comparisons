I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as a saint, handling the divorce well and being a good co-parent. The author feels a sense of guilt from the affair and wants to make amends by giving her the money, which would help her financially. His girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and that he still loves the ex-wife. The author says he doesn't love the ex-wife anymore, just respects her.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The author's actions are motivated by a desire to right past wrongs and support his children's mother. The ex-wife is in a better position to accept the money without conflict, especially since they have a good co-parenting relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, but the author hasn't actually done anything unethical towards her yet. He hasn't given the money yet, just plans to. The girlfriend's threat of breaking up comes from her own feelings, which may be valid, but the author's decision is based on his moral reasoning. \n\nLegally, unless there's a prenuptial agreement or court order preventing such a transfer, he can give money to whomever he wants. Ethically, it's more about his intentions. If his intentions are genuine and he's not favoring the ex-wife in a way that harms the current relationship, then it's a personal choice. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important too. The author might need to consider communication and whether his actions could cause unnecessary harm to the current relationship. But since the money is for co-parenting and respecting the children's mother, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe author hasn't given the money yet, so it's a future action. The key points are his intent to make amends, the ex-wife's positive role, and the potential conflict with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's anger could be about feeling replaced or not respected, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her feelings over his moral decision. However, in a relationship, partners should discuss such big decisions. The author might be in the right if he's transparent and respects both his ex-wife and girlfriend's needs, but if he ignores the girlfriend's perspective entirely, it could be problematic. Since he hasn't acted yet, the judgment might be more on his intent rather than the action itself.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His actions are driven by a desire to do right by his children and ex-wife, which is ethically defensible. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but doesn't make the author wrong unless he's violating some agreed-upon boundaries. Since he hasn't breached those, the answer is B.\n"
