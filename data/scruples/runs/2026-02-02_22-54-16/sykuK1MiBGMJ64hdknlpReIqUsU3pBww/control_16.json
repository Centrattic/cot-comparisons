I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite his girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author won a significant amount of money. He's considering giving a large sum to his ex-wife, who was hurt by his affair but handled the divorce amicably. The ex-wife works a low-paying job and the author wants to help her and their kids. His current girlfriend is upset, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intentions, the ex-wife's situation, the girlfriend's reaction, and the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nThe author's motivation is to show gratitude and make amends for the past mistake. He's not in a relationship with his ex now, but they co-parent. The ex-wife is described as a saintly figure, and the money would help her and the kids. The author has consulted his parents and a lawyer, who support the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset, which is understandable. She might feel neglected or that he's not being fair. But the author isn't in a legal obligation to his ex-wife beyond child support, assuming he's already covering that. Giving a gift could be seen as a personal choice, especially since the ex-wife helped him during the divorce. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to help a former spouse if you're not legally required? It's a personal decision. The author isn't taking away from his current relationship but is gifting money. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not discussing it with her first could be a misstep. But the author had a right to make the decision, especially if it's to help his children's mother. \n\nThe ex-wife didn't ask for the money, so it's a voluntary gesture. The author's lawyer being on board suggests there's no legal issue. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or feeling undervalued, but it doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a personal choice to right past wrongs and support his children's mother. The answer should be B (No)."
