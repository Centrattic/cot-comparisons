I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife is the right move, especially considering his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, the context: The author won a significant amount of money. He's planning to give a large portion to his ex-wife, who is the mother of his two children. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. His ex-wife has been a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping the divorce as painless as possible. She works a low-paying job, so he wants to help her out. His parents and lawyer support this, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore but still loves her as a mother and co-parent.\n\nSo, the main points here are about intent, relationships, and financial decisions. The ex is a parent, and he wants to support her. But he's in a new relationship, and his actions are causing conflict there. \n\nHe's giving the money out of gratitude and to make amends for his past mistake (the affair). The ex is not asking for it, but he wants to give it as a way to show he's not a complete asshole. The girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the money is his to give (like a lottery win, which isn't part of marital assets since they're divorced), then he has the right to do so. However, relationship-wise, not involving his current partner in this decision might be a problem. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings matter. \n\nThe key here is whether he's obligated to consult his girlfriend before making such a financial commitment, especially since they are in a relationship. While he's not legally bound to consult her, in a healthy relationship, major financial decisions that affect the relationship dynamics should be discussed. His girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which could indicate that he's not considering the impact on their current relationship. \n\nThe question is if he's in the wrong. If he's using his own money, and there's no legal issue, then technically he's not in the wrong. However, in terms of relationship responsibilities, by not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for her to feel secondary, he might be at fault for not communicating properly. \n\nBut the other side is that his ex-wife is the mother of his children, and supporting her could be seen as a responsible action. However, the method of giving without considering the girlfriend's perspective might be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the obligation is to his ex (as a parent) or to his current partner. Since he's financially supporting his children's mother, it's a valid action. But in a relationship, how he handles it matters. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend is threatening to break up and he feels relieved, maybe he prioritizes his ex's needs over his current partner's feelings. But since the money is his to give, and he's not in love with his ex, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the way he handled it without discussing with his girlfriend might be where the fault lies. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for giving the money, not for not discussing it. \n\nIn many cases, people might say that using his own money to help someone he has a history with isn't wrong, but the relationship with his girlfriend is strained because of it. So it's a gray area, but since he's not obligated to consult her, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and his actions are causing harm, maybe there's some fault. \n\nI think the general consensus in such situations is that while giving the money isn't wrong, not considering the girlfriend's feelings is. But the question is if he's in the wrong, which is a bit subjective. In the original AITA context, people often say it's not the person's fault if they're acting with good intentions and within legal bounds. So the answer might be B.\n"
