I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite their girlfriend's anger. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife. The ex-wife is described as a saint, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives, even though she's still hurt. He wants to give her money because he feels guilty and wants to show he cares. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the man's lawyer is on board, so he's probably not violating any agreements. Financially, he's the one who won the money, so he has the right to give it away. Emotionally, his reasoning is that he wants to make amends for his past mistakes and help his ex-wife and kids. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling disrespected, which is understandable because the ex-wife and girlfriend don't get along, and she might feel he's prioritizing the ex.\n\nHowever, the man is clear that he's not in love with the ex anymore. He's focused on the kids and his ex's well-being. The ex's reaction was positive, which supports the idea that she doesn't want to take advantage but sees it as genuine. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or feeling compared to the ex, but the man's actions are about reconciliation and support for his children's mother.\n\nSo, considering the intentions and circumstances, the man isn't wrong in giving the money. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the man isn't at fault for wanting to do the right thing by his family. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
