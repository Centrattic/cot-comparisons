I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from a lottery win, despite his girlfriend being angry about it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won a significant amount of money. He wants to give some to his ex-wife, who he divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as a good person, and the author feels a sense of guilt for the affair and wants to make amends by helping her financially. The ex-wife works a low-paying job and the author thinks this money would help her and their children. His parents and lawyer support the idea, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still loves the ex-wife.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, as long as there are no legal restrictions (like court orders) preventing him from giving money to his ex-wife, he's probably fine. The lawyer's support suggests there are no legal issues. But morally and ethically, it's more complicated. The author is trying to make amends for past wrongs, which could be seen as commendable. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel disrespected or not included in such a significant decision. \n\nThe author hasn't discussed this with the ex-wife yet, but he's moving forward. The girlfriend might feel that this decision was made without considering her feelings, which could be a breach of trust. However, the author's reasons are rooted in wanting to support his children and his ex-wife's well-being, which are legitimate. He's not in a relationship with his ex-wife anymore, so giving her money isn't necessarily inappropriate. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intentions are to right past wrongs, support his children, and help his ex-wife. The girlfriend's anger is about feeling disrespected and possibly fearing that the author still has feelings for the ex-wife. The author clarifies he's not in love with his ex-wife but still loves her as a co-parent and mother. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's acting on genuine remorse and the money isn't from shared assets (since it's his own lottery win), then legally and morally, he's not in the wrong. However, the way he handled the situation with his girlfriend could be improved. He should communicate better to address her feelings, but the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. The answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
