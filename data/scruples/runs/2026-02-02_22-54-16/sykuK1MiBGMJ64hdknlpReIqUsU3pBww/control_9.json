I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large amount of money to his ex-wife, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a substantial portion to his ex-wife. They divorced six years ago because he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is portrayed as kind, allowing him to see the kids, and even though she doesn't talk to the girlfriend, she's respectful. The ex works a low-paying job, and he wants to help her and their kids. The girlfriend is furious, thinks he's disrespecting her and still in love with the ex, and he's considering breaking up with her.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, the author is trying to make amends for his past mistake by supporting his ex-wife and their children financially. He hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet but has consulted his parents and lawyer. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author doesn't love her anymore and feels relieved by her threats to break up.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the money is his to do with as he wishes, especially since it's his windfall. He's using it to help his children's mother and improve their lives. The ex-wife didn't ask for it, but he feels it's a way to show he's not a complete failure. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt because he's giving money to someone else, especially his ex, which she perceives as showing lingering affection. However, the author clarifies he's not in love with his ex anymore but respects her as a mother.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to give money to an ex unless there's a court order for child support, which isn't mentioned here. The lawyer's approval suggests there's no legal issue. The girlfriend has no legal claim to the money since the author is not married to her. Emotionally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's decision is about making amends and supporting his children, which is a personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she might feel he's prioritizing his ex over her, even if it's not about love. The author's relief at her threats indicates he's not in a healthy relationship. However, the core issue is whether giving money to the ex is wrong. Since it's his money and he's using it to help his family, especially the mother of his children, it's not morally wrong. The ex didn't force him to give it, so it's a generous act.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not discussing it with his girlfriend first, but since they're not married, he's under no obligation to consult her. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities and feeling disrespected, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to support his children's mother. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
