I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to his ex-wife after winning the lottery, which his girlfriend is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex-wife is a good person, allowed him to stay in his kids' lives, and they have a civil relationship. He wants to give her a significant amount of money to help her out, as she works a low-paying job. His girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful, and he's considering giving the money anyway.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider ethical and legal aspects. Legally, unless there's a court order or agreement preventing him from giving money to his ex, he can do so. But ethically, with his current girlfriend, this is a relationship issue. He's making a decision that affects his current partner, and not consulting her might be a problem. \n\nThe ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he has a duty to support them, which he's already doing. Giving her additional money could be seen as a way to make amends for the past. However, his girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. The man says he's not in love with his ex but still loves her as a parent. \n\nBut in a relationship, big financial decisions that affect the partner should be discussed. Even though the ex is a parent, the girlfriend might feel that this is a betrayal, especially given the history of the affair. The man's actions could be seen as prioritizing past obligations over current commitments, which could be a point of contention. \n\nSo, the main factors are: legal permissibility, ethical obligations to the ex-wife and children, and the impact on the current relationship. The author isn't breaking the law, and his intentions are good, but the way he's handling it without considering his girlfriend's feelings might be where he's wrong. The answer depends on whether the decision to give the money without discussing it with his girlfriend is ethically wrong, even if it's not illegal.\n"
