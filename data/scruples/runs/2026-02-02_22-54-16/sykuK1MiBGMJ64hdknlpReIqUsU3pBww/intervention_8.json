I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who gave their ex-wife a large sum of money from a lottery win is in the wrong, especially since their current girlfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The ex-wife is the mother of their two kids. The divorce happened six years ago because the author had an affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife handled the situation gracefully, allowing continued co-parenting and maintaining a respectful relationship. The author feels a sense of guilt from the past affair and wants to make amends by giving her a significant portion of his lottery winnings.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions. He wants to show appreciation and provide financial support for his ex-wife, considering her financial situation and his children's well-being. He also mentions that his parents and lawyer support this decision. The girlfriend is upset, feeling disrespected and perhaps threatened, even though the author isn't in love with the ex-wife anymore.\n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. If he's giving the money to support his children and his ex-wife, especially given her financial constraints and his own guilt from past mistakes, it's a form of responsibility and reconciliation. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. The ethical question is whether giving money to an ex-wife for legitimate reasons is wrong, especially when it's in the best interest of the children.\n\nIn many cases, co-parenting requires financial support beyond the relationship itself. The author isn't giving the money for romantic reasons but for practical and moral ones. The girlfriend's anger might stem from insecurity or a sense of being undervalued, but the author's actions are justified in the context of his children's well-being and past obligations.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making this decision, which could be seen as dismissive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for the act itself. If the money is intended for legitimate purposes like supporting the ex-wife and children, then he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional, but the author's actions have a valid rationale.\n"
