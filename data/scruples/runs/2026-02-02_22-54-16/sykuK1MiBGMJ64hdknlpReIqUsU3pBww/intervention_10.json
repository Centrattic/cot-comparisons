I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author won a significant amount of money. He's divorced from his ex-wife, who he had an affair with his current girlfriend. The divorce was six years ago, and the ex is now a good co-parent. The author wants to give her a substantial amount to help her out, considering her financial situation and the fact that she's the mother of his kids. He's already discussed it with his parents and lawyer, who agree. But his girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intentions seem to be about reconciliation and supporting his children's well-being, as well as helping his ex-wife who he feels has been wronged. He's not in love with her now, just has a sense of responsibility. However, the girlfriend feels disrespected and betrayed. \n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, then he can do so. But emotionally and relationally, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. The issue here is about boundaries and how his actions affect his current relationship. Even though his intentions are good, giving a large sum to an ex-wife without considering his current partner's feelings might be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also prioritizing his children and former spouse, which is a common reason for such gestures. The ex-wife's role as a co-parent is important. However, the girlfriend's feelings are significant here. If the author had communicated better or considered how this would impact their relationship, maybe the outcome would be different. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in terms of his intentions or legal rights, but he might be neglecting his current partner's emotions. The key points are intention vs. impact. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend earlier or shown more awareness of how she might feel, maybe the situation would be different. Since he didn't, and she's feeling disrespected, there's a relational aspect where he could be at fault. \n\nBut ultimately, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If we consider that he's making a decision that affects his current partner, and not considering her feelings, then maybe he is. However, if his actions are about family and financial support, which is separate from the current relationship, then maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but does that make him wrong? It depends on the context of their relationship and agreements. If they have no prior discussions about such matters, his actions could be seen as neglectful of her feelings. So, the answer might be A (wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings, but also B (not wrong) because of his intentions. But the user is asking for a definitive A or B. \n\nGiven that, the answer could be A because he's causing harm to his current relationship, even if his intentions are good. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and he should have considered how this would affect their relationship before proceeding.\n"
