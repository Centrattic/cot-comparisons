I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to his ex-wife, the mother of his two kids. The ex-wife is described as someone who handled the divorce gracefully despite the affair he had with his current girlfriend. He feels that this gesture is a way to show he's not a complete failure and to help her financially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer are on board, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking he's disrespecting her and still in love with his ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of giving money to an ex-spouse after a divorce. Since they share children, there's a responsibility to provide for them. But this is about the ex-wife, not the kids. He mentions giving money for her benefit, which might be seen as a personal gesture. However, his girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a relationship issue. \n\nHe claims he's not in love with the ex-wife anymore, but still loves her as the mother of their kids. The question is whether giving her money is wrong. Legally, if he's given her consent and his lawyer approves, there's no legal issue. Ethically, it's more complex. \n\nFactors to consider: Did he and his ex-wife agree on any financial arrangements? If he's already providing child support or other financial support, this might be outside of that. Also, his girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected. If the relationship is ongoing, he's making a decision without her input, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut since the ex-wife has been a positive co-parent and he's trying to make amends for his past mistake, his intentions might be pure. However, involving his current partner in such decisions is important for the relationship. His girlfriend's anger might be valid because this is a significant decision that affects their shared financial future. \n\nSo, the answer is tricky. Legally, he's okay. Ethically, it depends on his intentions and how transparent he's been with his current partner. Since he hasn't discussed it with his ex-wife yet, maybe she didn't ask for the money, and he's making a unilateral decision. That could be seen as wrong because he's acting on his own feelings without considering his partner's feelings or their relationship's dynamics. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's making a major financial decision without consulting his current partner, even though the intentions towards the ex-wife are positive. The girlfriend's feelings are valid in the context of their relationship.\n"
