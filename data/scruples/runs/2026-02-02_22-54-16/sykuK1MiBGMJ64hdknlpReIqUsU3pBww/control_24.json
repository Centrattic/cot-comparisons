I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money he won, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. His ex-wife was understanding and allowed him to stay in his kids' lives. Now he's won a large sum and wants to give her a significant amount to help her out. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he still loves his ex-wife, but he's not in love with her anymore\u2014just respects her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from a legal standpoint, he's entitled to his money. There's no law against giving money to an ex-spouse. But morally and emotionally, it's more complex. The ex-wife is the mother of his children, and he wants to support them. However, his girlfriend feels disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's reasons for giving the money, the ex-wife's reaction, and the girlfriend's feelings. The author's intention is to make amends and support his kids' mother, which is commendable. His ex-wife didn't ask or demand the money, and she was happy for him. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling neglected or not trusted, but the author isn't in love with his ex-wife anymore. \n\nHowever, giving a large sum without discussing it with his current partner is a relationship issue. He should consider how this action affects his current relationship. But ethically, supporting your children's mother isn't inherently wrong. The author's parents and lawyer support him, which adds weight to his decision being reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If he's giving money to an ex, it could be seen as prioritizing her over his current partner. But the author's explanation is about supporting his kids and acknowledging his ex's sacrifices. The ex-wife's financial situation is also a factor\u2014she works a low-paying job and could benefit from the support.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action might be seen as insensitive to his girlfriend, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his intentions are good. The main issue is communication and considering the girlfriend's feelings, but the act itself isn't morally wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
