I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to his divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. Now, he's won a large amount of money and wants to give a significant portion to his ex-wife, who works a low-paying job. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with his ex. The author says he's not in love with his ex anymore but wants to show appreciation for her role as a mother and to help their kids.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's intentions, the girlfriend's reaction, and the legal aspects. The author's ex-wife is a good parent, and he feels indebted to her. The girlfriend feels disrespected and is considering breaking up. The author is conflicted but still plans to give the money.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Legally, after a divorce, unless there's a prenuptial agreement or court order, the author can decide how to spend his money. So legally, he's not in the wrong. But ethically? Well, the ex-wife's well-being and the kids could be a valid reason. However, the girlfriend feels wronged. Did the author consult the girlfriend? Probably not, which might be a mistake. But the author might have a right to help his ex-wife as a co-parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is his current partner. Giving a large sum to an ex could be seen as prioritizing past relationships over the current one, which might hurt the girlfriend. The affair was his fault, so maybe the girlfriend's insecurity is justified. The author's actions might be seen as disrespecting the current relationship.\n\nBut the author's intent is to make amends and support his kids. The ex-wife's job is low-paying, and the money could improve her and the kids' lives. The author's parents and lawyer agree, which adds some support. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, and the author is relieved by the breakup threats. That might indicate some underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a mix of factors. Legally, no. Ethically, it's debatable. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand, maybe they could have resolved it together. But since he's already decided not to change his plan, maybe he's not in the wrong for following through. However, considering the girlfriend's feelings and the potential for hurt, maybe he should have been more considerate. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his decision is wise.\n\nIn the end, the author's intentions are good, and the legal right is on his side. The wrong here might be more on the girlfriend's side for threatening to break up over this, but the question is about the author. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the girlfriend's feelings are valid. But given the context, the author's actions have a valid reason, so the answer is B.\n"
