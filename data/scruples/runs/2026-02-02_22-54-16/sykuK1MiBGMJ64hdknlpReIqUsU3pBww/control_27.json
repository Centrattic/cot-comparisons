I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a large sum of money to his ex-wife despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author won a significant amount of money and wants to give a large portion to his ex-wife. Their divorce was six years ago due to his affair with his current girlfriend. The ex-wife is described as being gracious and supportive during the divorce, allowing continued contact with their kids. The author feels this is a way to show appreciation and help her financially, especially since she works a low-paying job. His parents and lawyer support him, but his girlfriend is furious, thinking it's disrespectful and that he still has feelings for his ex-wife.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are the intentions behind the action and the impact on current relationships. The author's reasons include gratitude towards his ex for her role in co-parenting and wanting to support her financially. However, giving a large sum of money could be seen as a financial decision that affects his current partner, especially since they are in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because such a significant financial gesture without her consent might be perceived as a breach of trust or disrespect. \n\nIn many cultures, major financial decisions affecting a partner are considered a joint matter. The author didn't consult his girlfriend, which could lead to feelings of exclusion. Even if his intentions are noble, the action might be seen as insensitive to his current partner's feelings. However, if there's no legal or ethical binding (like a prenuptial agreement) about such matters, the author might argue his autonomy. But relationships often require mutual respect and communication, so not discussing such a big decision with his girlfriend could be seen as a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-wife's right to inherit or receive support after a divorce might be a factor. If the divorce terms didn't address this, it's up to the author's discretion. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about the current relationship's respect. \n\nBalancing these factors, the answer hinges on whether not consulting the girlfriend was wrong. Since the money is his to give, but the gesture impacts the current relationship, it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, he may have failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings, which could be seen as a relational mistake.\n"
