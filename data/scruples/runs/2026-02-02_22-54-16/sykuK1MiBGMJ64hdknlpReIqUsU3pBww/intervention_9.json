I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large amount of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to the divorce from his ex-wife. The ex is portrayed as a saint, allowing him to see the kids and keeping things amicable despite the pain. The author feels he owes her something, both as the mother of their children and because he regrets his past actions. He hasn't told the ex yet but has discussed it with his parents and lawyer. His girlfriend is upset, thinking it's disrespectful and that he's still in love with the ex.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors here might be his intentions and the impact on all parties. He wants to give money to support the kids and improve their lives, and the ex's job is low-paying. He loves his kids and wants to do right by them. However, his girlfriend feels disrespected, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't in a legal or contractual obligation to give the ex money beyond child support. But he's choosing to do it as a gesture of goodwill and to make amends. It's his money to do with as he pleases, especially if part of it is for the children's benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she might feel neglected or that he's not fully committed to their relationship. However, the author states he's not in love with the ex anymore, just has a bond because of the kids. The girlfriend's reaction might be partly about insecurity. \n\nThe author hasn't consulted the ex yet, which could lead to complications if she's not in agreement. But he's taking steps to ensure it's handled properly with legal advice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem to be driven by a desire to right past wrongs and support his children. While the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal choice with his money, especially when it benefits the kids. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
