I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery winnings, despite his girlfriend being angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man had an affair with his current girlfriend, leading to a divorce from his ex-wife six years ago. His ex-wife was saint-like in the divorce, allowing him to stay in the kids' lives. Now, he wants to give her a significant amount of money from his lottery win to show appreciation and help her out, as she works a low-paying job. His girlfriend is furious, thinking he's still in love with the ex, but he says he's just grateful as a parent.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, giving money to an ex-wife isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's for the kids' benefit and to show gratitude. However, there are a few angles to consider. The ex-wife is the mother of his kids, so supporting them is important. But his current girlfriend's feelings are valid too. He didn't consult her before making this decision, which could be a point of contention in their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are the intention behind the gift and how it affects his current relationship. If his intention is genuine and about family, then it's understandable. However, not discussing it with his girlfriend first might be a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or replaced by the ex-wife. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not giving her the money out of obligation to the ex-wife but because of his children and gratitude, and considering the ex-wife's role in his kids' lives, it's more about his family. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important in their relationship. If the man is prioritizing his ex-wife over his current partner without considering her feelings, that could be an issue. But the author claims not to be in love with the ex-wife, just loving her as the kids' mother. \n\nSo, the answer depends on cultural or personal values. In some perspectives, helping family is right regardless of the current partner's feelings. In others, not involving the partner in such a major financial decision could be seen as a breach of trust. But the fact that he consulted his parents and lawyer suggests he's considering other opinions, which might mitigate the issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong, but if the man's intentions are pure and the ex-wife's contribution to the kids is significant, it's hard to say he's wrong. However, the relationship with his girlfriend is also a factor. Maybe the issue is more about communication than the act itself. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his actions are driven by genuine reasons, but he could have handled the communication better.\n"
