I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for giving his ex-wife a large sum of money from his lottery win, despite his girlfriend's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had an affair with his current girlfriend, which led to his divorce. His ex-wife, despite the betrayal, stayed a good co-parent and has been respectful. The author feels he owes her and wants to give her a significant portion of his winnings. His girlfriend is upset, thinking he's still in love with the ex. The author says he's not in love, just grateful and wants to support her.\n\nNow, who is \"in the wrong\"? The key points here are the motivations and the context of the gift. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and making amends for past mistakes. However, there's the aspect of giving money to an ex without the current partner's consent, which can be a sensitive issue. \n\nLegally, if the money is his to give, he might have the right. But emotionally and relationally, this can cause a rift. The girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling disrespected and possibly fearing abandonment or favoritism over her. The author's parents and lawyer support him, but the girlfriend is his current partner, and her feelings matter in the relationship.\n\nThe author hasn't consulted the ex-wife yet, which might be a mistake. Also, the girlfriend's threat to break up is a red flag. Even if the author isn't in love with the ex, the action might be seen as prioritizing past relationships over the current one. \n\nBut on the other hand, the ex-wife is the mother of his children, and supporting her could be in the kids' best interest. The author's intentions are noble, but the way he's handling it\u2014without discussing with the girlfriend\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a gray area. If the action is causing significant harm to the current relationship, maybe yes. But if the intention is genuine and for the right reasons, maybe not. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's a major financial decision that affects the current relationship. The author should have communicated better and considered the girlfriend's perspective before making such a move. Hence, he might be in the wrong for not involving her in the decision-making process.\n"
