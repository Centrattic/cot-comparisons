I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person won a large sum of money and wants to give a significant amount to their ex-wife, who's the mother of their kids. The ex-wife was a saint during the divorce because of the affair with the current girlfriend. The author is considering giving the money to help her out financially and as a way to show they care despite their past mistakes. The current girlfriend is really upset and wants to break up over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentioned talking to their lawyer, who was surprised but on board. So legally, there might not be a problem. But since it's their own money, they might have the right to give it away, right? However, if there were any legal obligations or if the money was part of a settlement, that could be different. But the author says it's a windfall they won, so maybe that's not an issue.\n\nNext, the emotional and relational aspects. The ex-wife is a good co-parent, and the author still loves her, but not in a romantic way. The author feels this is a way to make amends. But the current girlfriend is taking it as a personal slight and feeling disrespected. The author might not be in love anymore, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's his current partner. Giving money to an ex can be seen as giving preferential treatment, which might hurt the current partner's feelings. \n\nThe author's intention is good\u2014he wants to help his ex-wife and kids. But the girlfriend might feel that the author is still emotionally attached to the ex, even if that's not the case. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his decision would affect his current relationship. The girlfriend's anger could be about feeling disrespected, not just about the money. \n\nIn relationships, actions can have symbolic meanings. Giving money to an ex after a divorce, especially the mother of their children, is a gray area. It's understandable for the author to want to do something nice for his ex, but it's important to communicate with his current partner. The author might have made a mistake by not discussing it more with his girlfriend before making plans. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the action is legal and done with good intentions, maybe not. But if it's hurting his current partner and he didn't consider her feelings, then he might be wrong. However, there's also the aspect of being a good co-parent and helping his children's mother. It's a tough call. \n\nThe author could be in the wrong if he didn't respect his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Even if his intentions are good, the impact on his current relationship is significant. On the other hand, if the ex-wife is a co-parent and the money is for the kids' benefit, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's his current partner, and her feelings matter too. \n\nIn the end, it's about balancing both relationships. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, he might have overlooked his current partner's perspective. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's causing distress to his girlfriend without considering her feelings, even if his intentions are good. But there's also the argument that he's trying to do the right thing by his kids and ex-wife, which is B. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key here is whether the action was respectful to both partners. Since he didn't consider his current girlfriend's perspective, he might be wrong.\n"
