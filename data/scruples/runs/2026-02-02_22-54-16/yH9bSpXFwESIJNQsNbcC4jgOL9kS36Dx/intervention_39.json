In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author initially struggled with the request due to financial and time constraints but agreed to prepare a meal.\n\n2. She made multiple efforts to coordinate: checking in the morning, setting a time, and reminding about the 6:30 PM cutoff.\n\n3. The brother was aware of her effort and was running late, but ultimately arrived about an hour late.\n\n4. The brother used extremely disrespectful language (\"SHUT UP YOU PRICK\") during a phone call, which is clearly outside the bounds of normal sibling interactions.\n\n5. The author responded by hanging up and refusing to let him come over, especially given the cold and rainy weather.\n\n6. The brother later turned back from the house and went home, claiming it was because of the weather, but provided a non-apology.\n\nThe author's actions were a direct response to being verbally abused. She had invested significant time and resources into preparing a meal, only to be spoken to in a disrespectful manner. Her decision to cut off the interaction was a reasonable response to being treated poorly.\n\nWhile the brother had made plans, the author had every right to set boundaries regarding respectful communication. The situation escalated when the brother crossed a line with his verbal abuse. The author's refusal to let him come over was not about his lateness, but about the disrespectful language used.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the author was justified in her response. She had communicated her expectations clearly, and the brother violated those expectations through verbal abuse. The author's actions were a reasonable response to being spoken to in such a disrespectful manner.\n"
