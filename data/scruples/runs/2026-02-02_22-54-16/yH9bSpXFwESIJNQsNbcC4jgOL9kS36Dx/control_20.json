In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author, who is the older sister, agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend during a busy and broke Christmas time. She initially hesitated but then arranged a time. The brother asked for 6 PM, which she agreed to. She spent the day preparing, and even warned him via text not to be late, mentioning the effort she put in. The brother called at 5:30 to say he was running late, which was typical. They had planned for that. Then, at 7:30, he called again, still on the bus. The author interrupted him, and he shouted at her, calling her a prick. She hung up and texted him that it was inconvenient and he should find something else. He was already near her house but turned back because it was cold and rainy. He gave a non-apology. She refuses to apologize and thinks he's wrong for being rude. The brother insists she should apologize for turning him away in the cold, but the author disagrees.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the brother agreed to a time, and he was late. The author had already planned for potential delays. But when he was an hour late, he was rude. The author's response was to hang up and tell him it's inconvenient. The brother claims she's at fault for turning him away in bad weather. The author claims the brother's rudeness was the issue.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about who was at fault. The brother didn't show up on time despite being warned, and then was disrespectful. The author felt disrespected and cut off communication. But the brother then arrived late and left, leading to wasted food. The brother is now upset she didn't let him in.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she put in a lot of effort, was patient with his previous lateness, but his outburst was the last straw. She stood her ground on respecting her own boundaries. From the brother's side, he might feel that the inconvenience of being late (and the weather) was worse than his rude behavior.\n\nBut the key here is the brother's disrespectful behavior. Shouting and being rude is not acceptable, regardless of the situation. The sister had a right to set boundaries. However, she did turn him away after he was already nearby, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but perhaps justified given his treatment of her. The brother's non-apology is also a red flag.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister had the right to refuse to engage with someone who was being abusive. The brother's actions in being late and rude were the initial issues. So the sister's reaction, while perhaps harsh, was a response to his disrespect. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
