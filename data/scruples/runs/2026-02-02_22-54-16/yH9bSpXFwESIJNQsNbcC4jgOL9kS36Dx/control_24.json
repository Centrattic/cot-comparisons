In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain after he was late and got angry.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author agreed to cook lunch for their brother and his girlfriend. They had to rearrange things because they were busy and broke, but managed to set a time. The brother kept being late, which was typical. The author warned him not to be too late. When he was significantly late, he called and the author interrupted him, leading to an argument where the brother yelled. The author hung up and told him not to come over. It was raining, and the brother ended up going home. Now, the brother says turning him away in the cold is worse than the yelling. The author is upset and wants to know if they were wrong.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the author was wrong. The key points here are the brother's behavior. He shouted at the author, which the author clearly found unacceptable. The author felt disrespected and stood their ground by not letting him come. The brother, on the other hand, might feel that the author was unkind for sending him away in bad weather. \n\nThe author's actions: They set boundaries. They warned the brother about the timing. When the brother was late and lashed out, the author defended their own dignity by cutting the call. Then, when the brother arrived later, they refused to let him in. The author is also upset about the wasted food, which adds to their frustration.\n\nThe brother's side: He might have had a valid reason for being late, or maybe he was stressed. His yelling was inappropriate, but perhaps he felt misunderstood. He might think the author overreacted by not letting him come in after the argument. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author had already put in a lot of effort. They were accommodating by adjusting their schedule. The brother's late arrival and yelling crossed a line. The author's decision to not let him in was a result of being disrespected. The brother's insistence on an apology might stem from feeling guilty for his own actions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's behavior was definitely at fault. Yelling like that is unkind and disrespectful. The author had every right to feel upset and to enforce their boundaries. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not letting the brother in after he was hostile. The brother's response that turning him away is worse than the yelling is backwards; the yelling was the initial offense. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of hanging up, perhaps they could have cooled down and made a different decision. But given the context, the author's actions were a justified response to being yelled at. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
