In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the sister) is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after a conflict.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She made an effort despite being busy and broke. The brother was late, which he's known for, and she warned him. When he finally called at 7:30, he was still on the bus and shouted at her. She felt disrespected and hung up, telling him not to come. He did return, but it was raining, and she turned him away. Now he's upset and insists she's wrong.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn her side: She put in a lot of effort, asked him to be on time, he was disrespectful, and she felt justified in cutting him off. Her reaction to his yelling seems reasonable. She's also considering donating the food, which shows she's not being spiteful.\n\nOn his side: He was trying to arrive, maybe underestimating the travel time. He did apologize, albeit a \"non-apology,\" and maybe he felt hurt that she turned him away in bad weather.\n\nKey points: The brother's outburst was the trigger. The sister had the right to set boundaries, especially after being disrespected. The brother's behavior was unkind, and the sister's reaction, while firm, was a response to that. The fact that she even made the effort initially shows she wasn't trying to be cruel. The brother's insistence that turning him away in the cold is worse might be a bit of a stretch, as the sister was protecting her own boundaries.\n\nI think the sister is not in the wrong here. She was clear about her expectations, he crossed a line, and she had the right to walk away. So the answer should be B.\n"
