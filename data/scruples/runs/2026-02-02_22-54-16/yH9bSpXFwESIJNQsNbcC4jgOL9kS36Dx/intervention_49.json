In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the key points.\n\nSo, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend during a busy, stressful time around Christmas. She had to adjust her schedule and prepare everything, even warning him to be on time. The brother was late, as usual, and when she called to check, he responded with an outburst of \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK.\" She hung up on him and refused to let him in when he arrived, leading to the food being wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister made an effort to accommodate her brother despite her own constraints. She communicated her concerns about the timing and even asked him to be punctual. The brother, however, was late and then escalated the conflict with his shouting. His behavior seems disrespectful and inconsiderate, especially given the context of her making an effort.\n\nThe author's response was to cut off communication and not let him in, which led to the food being wasted. The brother is now insisting she's wrong for turning him away in the cold. The key issue here is the brother's disrespectful behavior versus the sister's right to set boundaries.\n\nI think the sister was within her rights to set a boundary when he was abusive. She shouldn't have to tolerate being shouted at, especially when she was making a significant effort. The brother's actions seem to disregard her feelings and the effort she put in. While the food going to waste is unfortunate, her emotional well-being and respect are more important. It's also worth noting that the brother didn't apologize sincerely, which complicates the situation further.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected that people treat each other with respect. The sister's reaction to the verbal abuse is justified. The brother's behavior was the initial problem. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
