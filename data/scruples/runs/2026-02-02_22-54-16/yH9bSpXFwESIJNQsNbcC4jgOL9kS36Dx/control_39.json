In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. I need to analyze the situation based on the provided details.\n\nFirst, the brother asked for lunch, and the author agreed after some back and forth, even adjusting their schedule. Then the brother was late, which is typical for him. The author had planned for the delay. At 5:30 PM, the brother said he was running late again, and the author was okay with it. However, when the brother called at 7:30 PM, he was still on the bus. The author, who was on the phone and trying to handle the situation, got interrupted and shouted at by the brother. The brother called the author a \"prick,\" which is out of character in their relationship. The author hung up, told the brother he could find something better to do, and then the brother went to the corner, got cold and wet, turned back, and now is insisting the author should apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author made an effort to adjust their schedule and prepare the meal despite being busy and broke. The brother was repeatedly late, and when confronted, he responded with harsh language. The author felt disrespected and cut off communication. The brother then arrived too late, got cold, and didn't properly apologize. The author is upset about the wasted food and the interaction.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother's behavior of shouting and using aggressive language is definitely inconsiderate, especially since he was late and then lashed out. The author had every right to feel upset and set boundaries. On the other hand, the author did agree to the 6 PM slot, and the brother was still late, leading to the food being wasted. But the brother's outburst seems to be the main issue here. The author's response, while firm, was a reaction to being yelled at and disrespected. The brother is now framing the situation as the author turning him away in the cold, but the initial problem was his own lateness and aggressive behavior.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014hanging up and sending a text about the inconvenience\u2014were a result of the brother's disrespectful conduct. The brother's insistence on an apology from the author for not letting him in after he was late and rude might not be justified. The author's priority was their own comfort and the respect in their relationship, which the brother violated first.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending themselves from disrespectful treatment, not because they refused to let the brother in without notice. The brother's behavior was the root cause, and the author had a right to set boundaries. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
