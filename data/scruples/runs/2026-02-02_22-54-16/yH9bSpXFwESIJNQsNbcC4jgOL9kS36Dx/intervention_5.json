In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author's brother asked for lunch, and the author initially couldn't because of being busy and broke around Christmas. But then they agreed on a time, the brother came late, and when the author asked when he'd be there, the brother shouted at her. The author hung up and told him to find another place to eat. The brother ended up not showing up, and the author is upset about the wasted food. The brother says turning him away is worse than shouting, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author made an effort to cook a meal, set a time, and the brother was late. The brother's behavior was disrespectful\u2014shouting and using a derogatory term. The author stood their ground and decided not to let him in after the shouting. The brother is now upset that the author didn't let him in despite the bad weather.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries, respect, and expectations. The author had a right to feel disrespected and to not want to engage with someone who's being abusive. However, turning someone away in bad weather might be seen as harsh, especially if the person is apologetic afterward. But the brother's initial behavior (shouting) was pretty bad, so the author's response might be justified.\n\nAlso, the brother didn't apologize genuinely but gave a \"bullshit non-apology,\" which the author rightly dismissed. The author's main issue was the disrespectful communication, which is a valid reason to cut off interaction. The wasted food is an added regret, but the primary conflict was the brother's behavior.\n\nSo, considering that the author had the right to not tolerate abuse, even if it led to the brother being turned away, the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's actions were the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
