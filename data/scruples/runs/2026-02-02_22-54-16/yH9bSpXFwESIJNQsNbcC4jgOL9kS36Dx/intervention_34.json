In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. The situation is that the author agreed to cook lunch for their brother and his girlfriend, but the brother was late and got shouted at the author during a phone call. The author then hung up and told the brother not to come, so he ended up leaving in the rain. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother initially asked for lunch, the author made arrangements, but the brother was running late again. The author had warned him not to be too late, but he was still late. Then, during the phone call, the brother shouted at her, which the author found unacceptable. They hung up, and the brother ended up not coming, leaving the food wasted.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they put in a lot of effort and were respectful about the timing. The brother's behavior during the call was aggressive, which the author didn't appreciate. The author felt disrespected and decided to cut things off. The brother is now upset and wants an apology, but the author isn't willing to apologize.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The brother did agree to come at 6 and was late. The author had warned him. When the brother was late, the author was understanding but still had plans. The brother's aggressive response during the call was unprovoked and disrespectful. The author's response was to hang up and tell him not to come, which led to the brother being turned away in the rain.\n\nThe key here is the brother's behavior. If the brother was being rude or aggressive, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The author had made clear that they weren't okay with being shouted at. The brother's actions (shouting and not apologizing properly) contributed to the situation. The author didn't have an obligation to keep hosting if the brother was being disrespectful. \n\nHowever, turning someone away in the rain might seem harsh, but given the context of the brother's behavior, the author might feel justified. The brother might have a point about the food being wasted and the cold, but the author prioritized their own comfort and respect.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The brother was late and disrespectful, but the author's response was immediate and cut off the brother's opportunity to come. However, the author's stance is about respecting their own boundaries, which is reasonable. The brother's insistence on an apology might be because he's not seeing the disrespect he caused. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries after being disrespected. The brother's actions led to the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
