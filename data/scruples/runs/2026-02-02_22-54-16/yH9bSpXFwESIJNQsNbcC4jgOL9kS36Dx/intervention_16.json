In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. The key points to consider here are the context and the actions of both parties involved.\n\nFirst, the author made a plan to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, knowing she was busy and broke around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule to accommodate them, even though she was already stretched. The brother initially agreed on a time but then kept being late, which the author had anticipated. However, when she got a disrespectful response during their call, she hung up and sent a message that made it clear she wasn't willing to have someone talk to her that way. The brother then arrived late and was sent away in the cold, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe main issue here is the brother's behavior. He shouted at her, which the author rightly found unacceptable. The author's response to being disrespected by ending the call and setting boundaries is understandable. She had invested time, effort, and resources into preparing the meal, and being treated disrespectfully would naturally lead to frustration.\n\nHowever, the brother was left in the rain and cold. The user wonders if the author was in the wrong for turning him away. But considering the brother's disrespectful behavior, the author's decision to end the interaction might be justified. She prioritized her comfort and respect over his unexpected lateness and poor treatment.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author warned him about the timing and even adjusted her plans. The brother didn't communicate effectively and then reacted poorly when confronted. The author's actions were in response to being disrespected, which is a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nThe author's decision to give the food to a shelter also shows that she's trying to be considerate, which might mitigate her actions. The brother's insistence that she should apologize suggests he might not take responsibility for his part. \n\nIn summary, while the brother's lateness was a problem, the author had the right to enforce respect. Turning him away in the rain was a consequence of his actions. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
