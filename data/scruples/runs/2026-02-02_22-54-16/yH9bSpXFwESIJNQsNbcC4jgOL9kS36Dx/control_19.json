In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, even though she was busy and broke around Christmas. She had to juggle her schedule and prepare the meal. She communicated with him in the morning, set a time, and reminded him not to be late. The brother was late again, which she knew was typical, but when he was two hours late, he got angry and shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something better if it's that inconvenient. He then went to her house, got cold, went back home, and gave a non-apology. She's upset about the wasted food and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here: the sister made an effort to prepare the meal, the brother was late despite prior warnings and was disrespectful. She had a right to feel disrespected and angry. Turning someone away after they've been rude might seem harsh, but she had already communicated her expectations. The brother's behavior was unkind, especially shouting. She didn't want to associate with someone who treats her that way. The brother is now blaming her for turning him away, but the initial disrespect came from him. \n\nConsidering all this, the sister had a valid reason to be upset. She made clear her efforts and expectations. The brother didn't consider her situation and acted inconsiderately. While turning someone away in the rain is a tough call, the sister's actions were a response to his disrespectful behavior. So, the sister isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after being mistreated.\n"
