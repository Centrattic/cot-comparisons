In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister turning away her brother in the rain after a heated argument. The key points are:\n\n1. The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after initially hesitating because it was busy and she was broke. She made adjustments to accommodate them.\n\n2. The brother changed the time from the original agreement. He was late before and she had planned for that. When he was even later, she asked him to not be too late again. He got angry, shouted at her, and she hung up, telling him not to come.\n\n3. The brother was near her house but in the rain. He went but had to turn back, and now he's upset. The sister is upset because of the wasted food and the disrespect.\n\nThe question is whether the sister was wrong in turning him away. \n\nFirst, the brother's behavior seems to be the main issue. He shouted at her, which is disrespectful. The sister didn't appreciate that and cut him off. But was it right to turn him away, especially in the cold and rain? \n\nThe sister did spend time and money preparing the meal. She felt disrespected, so cutting him off could be seen as a reaction to his rudeness. However, turning him away after he was already nearby might have been a harsh response. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's behavior was inexcusable. Shouting and using a derogatory term like \"prick\" isn't acceptable. The sister had every right to stand up for herself and end the conversation. The brother's insistence that she should apologize for turning him away in the cold might be a way to deflect from his own actions.\n\nThe sister's response was an emotional reaction, but given the disrespect she received, it's understandable. The brother's non-apology adds to the tension. The sister donating the food shows she's not vindictive but wants to use it for good.\n\nSo, considering all that, the sister's actions were a response to disrespectful treatment. While turning someone away in the rain is harsh, the brother's behavior justified her standing up for herself. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
