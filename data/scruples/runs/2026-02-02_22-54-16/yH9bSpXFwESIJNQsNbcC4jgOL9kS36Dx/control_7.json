In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. The situation involves her cooking a meal for him and his girlfriend but he arrives late and she gets upset when he yells at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was already stressed due to being busy and broke around Christmas. She agreed to cook after some back and forth, adjusted her schedule, and specifically asked her brother not to be late. He was running late again, and when she called him out, he yelled at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find another place to eat. He then went to her house but turned around and went home because it was raining. Now she's upset about the wasted food and he's insisting she's in the wrong for not letting him in.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she set boundaries when he was disrespectful. She had already adjusted her plans, communicated her needs, and was clearly upset by his outburst. Her response was to cut off contact, which she feels was justified. However, she ended up not feeding him because he was already there, and he left in the rain. \n\nOn the other hand, her brother's actions included being late again despite warnings, yelling, and possibly not respecting her efforts. But he did try to come, even in bad weather, and she turned him away. He's now asking her to apologize, which she refuses. The key points here are mutual expectations and respect. She felt disrespected and acted on that, but he took it further by not eating the meal. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she had a right to set boundaries when he was disrespectful. However, turning him away in the rain might have been a harsh reaction, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The brother's behavior (yelling, being disrespectful) was inappropriate. The author's response, while firm, was a reaction to his disrespectful behavior. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
