In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook a meal for her brother after some back and forth, considering her own busy and financial situation. She made an effort to adjust her schedule and prepare the meal. She communicated clearly, even texting him to not be late. The brother kept being late, and when she called to check, he yelled at her. She felt disrespected and hung up, then sent a text saying he should find something else if that's the case. He ended up not coming, and she turned him away in the cold rain.\n\nNow, the key points here. The sister made an effort to accommodate, but the brother's behavior was disrespectful. The sister set boundaries after being yelled at. She didn't let him in because he was late and didn't apologize properly. The brother is upset she turned him away, but she stands by her decision.\n\nI need to consider if her actions were justified. She had a valid reason for being upset\u2014being shouted at. She clearly communicated her expectations. The brother's disrespect might have triggered her to cut the interaction. Turning him away in the rain could be seen as harsh, but if he was disrespectful and didn't apologize, maybe she's within her rights to enforce her boundaries. Also, she's trying to have a peaceful Christmas and doesn't want to deal with someone who disrespects her.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might argue he was in bad weather and she shouldn't have been so strict. But the sister's perspective is that the disrespect was the main issue. She gave him a chance, but after his outburst, she decided to end the interaction. Her actions were about self-respect and not compromising her peace of mind.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the sister's response was about protecting her own well-being after being disrespected. Even though the brother was in the cold, the sister's actions were a reaction to his behavior. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
