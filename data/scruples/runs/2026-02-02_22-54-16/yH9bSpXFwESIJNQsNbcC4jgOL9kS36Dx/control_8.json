In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister cooked dinner for her brother and his girlfriend, but he was late and they ended up not coming. The main issue seems to be the brother's outburst when the sister called him, which led her to hang up and refuse to let them in when they arrived.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The sister was already struggling with money and busy during the holidays. She agreed to cook after initially declining because she felt bad. She communicated the time, even adjusting for the brother's typical lateness. He was running late, but when she asked when he'd arrive, he yelled at her. She told him off and hung up. Then when they came later, they were in the rain, but she turned them away. Now the brother is insisting she should apologize, but she thinks he's wrong for yelling.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On her side, she was polite, communicated her concerns, and had set clear expectations. The brother's behavior was disrespectful, using aggressive language (\"SHUT UP YOU PRICK\") which she rightly found unacceptable. She stood her ground, which is understandable. She didn't make him come to her house in the rain; they chose to come after she told him off. Plus, she's the one who had the effort of cooking a meal that went to waste.\n\nOn the brother's side, he might argue that being in the cold and rain was harsh, but he was disrespectful first. Also, maybe he had a reason for being late and the situation was a misunderstanding. However, the sister's response to his outburst was justified. She has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding how she's treated. The brother's non-apology seems insincere.\n\nThe sister's actions were a reaction to disrespect. She had made efforts to accommodate him despite her own stress. Turning them away was a result of their argument, not premeditated. The brother's attitude towards apologizing seems dismissive of her feelings. \n\nI think the key here is the brother's disrespectful behavior. The sister had every right to be upset and to draw the line. She didn't force them into the rain; they came after the conflict. Her actions were a consequence of being disrespected. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
