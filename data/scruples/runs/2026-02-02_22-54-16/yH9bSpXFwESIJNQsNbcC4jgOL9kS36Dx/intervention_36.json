In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author made dinner for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already busy and broke, but she agreed to do it after some back and forth. The brother came late, and when he called at 7:30, he shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something better to do if it's going to be such a hassle. He ended up not showing up, and she's upset about the wasted food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's behavior. He was repeatedly late, even after being asked not to be. Then, he raised his voice and used harsh language, which the author found unacceptable. She hung up because of that. In any normal sibling relationship, mutual respect is key. If one person is being disrespectful, the other has the right to set boundaries. \n\nThe brother claimed that turning him away in the cold is worse than his outburst. But the author's main issue was the disrespect and the fact that she was working hard to prepare dinner. She didn't want to spend time with someone who talked to her like that. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, her actions were a reaction to the brother's disrespectful behavior. She made her position clear and stood by her decision not to apologize. The brother's insistence that she should apologize might be because he regrets not eating the food, not necessarily understanding her reasons.\n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and setting boundaries. The author was within her rights to refuse to engage with the brother after his disrespectful outburst. The brother's actions were the main issue here. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
