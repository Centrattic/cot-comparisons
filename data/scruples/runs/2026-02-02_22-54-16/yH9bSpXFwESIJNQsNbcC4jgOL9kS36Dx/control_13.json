In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning away their brother in the rain after an argument.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She had a hard time due to being busy and broke, but she managed to set it up. The brother kept being late, which they both know is typical. When he called at 7:30, she was annoyed and he shouted at her. She hung up and told him not to come, which he did but then left. He's upset about being turned away in the cold, while she's upset about his outburst. \n\nNow, I need to figure out if she was wrong. Let's break down the key points. She went out of her way to prepare a meal, communicated her limits, and he was late again, leading to a conflict. She felt disrespected when he shouted, which led her to cut things off. \n\nFrom her perspective, she had already put in a lot of effort, and the brother's disrespectful behavior crossed a line. She didn't want to engage with someone who was rude. Her reaction was to stop the plan, which he took as her turning him away in the rain. \n\nThe brother's side is that he was just running late, and when she hung up, he ended up getting caught in the rain. He's saying that her action of not letting him in was worse than his outburst. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she did ask him explicitly to be on time, and she warned him. When he was late and disrespectful, her reaction was to end the interaction. She didn't force him to come in after the argument. The brother's outburst was unprovoked, and she had the right to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, maybe she could have handled it differently. Instead of hanging up, maybe she could have calmly told him not to come. But in the heat of the moment, she chose to cut things off. \n\nHer actions were a reaction to disrespect, and she's not obligated to host someone who treats her poorly. The brother might not agree, but she's standing by her decision. The fact that she plans to donate the food shows she's trying to make the best of a bad situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She had valid reasons for feeling disrespected and set a boundary. The brother's behavior was the main issue here.\n"
