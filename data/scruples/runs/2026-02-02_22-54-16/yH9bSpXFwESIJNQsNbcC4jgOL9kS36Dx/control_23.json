In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. The situation involves the sister agreeing to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after some back and forth, but he ends up being late. She texts him to not be late, he is, then gets angry and yells at her. She hangs up and tells him to find something else to do if he's making it inconvenient. The brother claims turning him away in the cold is worse than the insult, but she disagrees.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The sister was in a vulnerable position, being broke and busy during Christmas. She made an effort to adjust her schedule and prepare a meal, even warning him about the time. When he was late, she was understanding, but then he yelled at her. That's a key point\u2014verbal abuse. The brother's reaction is aggressive and disrespectful, which the sister rightfully calls out. She had the right to set boundaries, especially after being insulted. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel hurt because he was turned away in the rain, but his initial action of yelling was the problem. The sister wasn't obligated to let him in after that. Her response to not apologize is justified because he didn't take responsibility. Instead, he gave a non-apology. \n\nThe sister also mentions she's going to donate the uneaten food, which shows she's trying to do something good despite the situation. The brother's insistence on her apologizing without acknowledging his own behavior is unfair. \n\nConsidering the sister's effort and the brother's disrespectful behavior, I think the sister made the right decision. She had the right to protect her emotional well-being and not tolerate being shouted at. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
