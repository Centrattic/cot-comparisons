In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister cooked a meal for her brother and his girlfriend, but he was late and got angry with her. She hung up on him and turned him away, even though it was raining. Now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The sister was already stressed because she's broke and busy around Christmas. She agreed to cook after initially hesitating. The brother asked for 6 o'clock, but she warned him not to be late. He was running late and then when she asked when he'd arrive, he shouted at her. She hung up and told him not to come over. He ended up going home, and she's upset about the wasted food.\n\nSo, the brother's behavior was unkind and disrespectful. Shouting at her when she's already put in a lot of effort is a big issue. The sister had every right to feel disrespected and to set a boundary. She wasn't being unkind for no reason. He was the one who was late multiple times and then lashed out. \n\nHowever, turning him away in the rain might be seen as a harsh response. But considering the context\u2014after being yelled at and feeling disrespected\u2014she might have felt justified. Also, she made an effort to prepare, and his attitude ruined her plans. The brother's non-apology doesn't help. \n\nShe's also trying to make the best of it by donating the food. It seems like she's not being unreasonable. The brother's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. So, the sister's decision to not let him come over was a reaction to his poor behavior. \n\nI think the main issue here is the brother's disrespect, not the sister's decision to turn him away. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
