In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's brother asked for lunch, which the author initially declined because of being busy and broke around Christmas. Then she agreed after some back and forth. The brother was supposed to come at 6, but he was running late. The author texted him to not be late, and he said he was running late again. At 7:30, he called and was on the bus, and the author interrupted him, he shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying if he's inconvenient, he should find something better. He went to her house but it was raining, and he left. He now wants an apology.\n\nThe author is upset that he's not apologizing and thinks she's not in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's look at the brother's actions. He agreed on a time, then was late, and she warned him. When he called at 7:30, he was still on the bus. Then he shouted at her, which is a red flag. The author felt disrespected and hung up. She texted him that if he's inconvenient, he should find another place. He went to her house, got cold and wet, then left. He now wants her to apologize for turning him away in the rain.\n\nSo, the brother's behavior was disrespectful when he shouted. The author had a right to feel upset. She had put in effort to prepare dinner and then had to deal with his disrespect. Her response was to cut off communication, which might have been harsh, but given his outburst, maybe understandable. The brother's reaction to her actions is questionable. He turned back in the rain but still wants an apology. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being disrespected. The brother's behavior was the main issue here. The fact that he's not apologizing even after his outburst shows he's not taking responsibility. So, the author is justified in her actions. Answer B.\n"
