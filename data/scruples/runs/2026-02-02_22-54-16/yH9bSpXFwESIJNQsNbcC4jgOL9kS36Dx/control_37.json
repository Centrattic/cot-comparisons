In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the sister is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook dinner for her brother and his girlfriend after initially declining due to being busy and broke around Christmas. She made several efforts to accommodate him, even adjusting her schedule. She communicated via phone and text, asking him not to be late. He ended up being over an hour late, and when she confronted him, he insulted her and she hung up. Then, when he arrived, she turned him away, leading to him going home in the rain.\n\nThe key points here are the communication and the brother's behavior. The sister had made it clear how important it was for him to be punctual, given the effort she put into preparing the meal. The brother's response was hostile, which upset her, leading her to cut off communication and refuse to let him in. Now, the brother is upset that she turned him away in the cold and wet, while she feels he disrespected her.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she did the right thing by setting boundaries after being disrespected. She had invested time and money into preparing the meal, and the brother's behavior crossed a line. His yelling and using derogatory language (\"you prick\") would be unacceptable in most relationships, especially between siblings. The sister's decision to walk away and not let him in could be seen as a valid response to his disrespectful behavior, especially after he didn't apologize properly.\n\nHowever, the brother's side is that he was in the rain and cold, and he's arguing that being turned away is worse than his outburst. But the sister's actions were a direct result of his disrespect and failure to consider her efforts. The sister had already warned him about the timing and the effort involved, so his lateness wasn't unexpected. His hostility escalated the situation, leading her to cut him off. \n\nThe sister also mentions that their relationship isn't based on casual banter, so his outburst was uncharacteristic and offensive. She's standing her ground, which is reasonable given the context. The meal going to waste is a loss, but she's trying to mitigate that by donating it, which is a positive step. \n\nConsidering all this, the sister isn't in the wrong. She set boundaries after being disrespected, and her actions were a reaction to his unacceptable behavior. The brother's insistence that she should apologize seems misplaced, especially since he didn't offer a genuine apology. The main issue here is the brother's disrespectful conduct, not the sister's response to it.\n"
