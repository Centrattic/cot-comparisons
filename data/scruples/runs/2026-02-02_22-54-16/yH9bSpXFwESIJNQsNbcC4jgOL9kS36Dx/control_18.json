In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether turning her brother away in the rain after he showed up late and got into an argument was justified.\n\nFirst, the setup: She agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend after initially declining because she was busy and broke. She put a lot of effort into making the dinner, planning for possible delays. Her brother was running late, and when she called to check, he shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something else if he's going to be like that. He ended up turning up late, got cold, and she refused to let him in. He's not apologizing, and she's upset about the wasted food.\n\nSo, the key points here are her expectations and the brother's behavior. She had communicated clearly about the timing and effort. He was late again, which might be a pattern. The confrontation on the phone where he shouted is a big issue. She felt disrespected and hung up. Then, when he arrived late, she turned him away in the rain. The brother claims she should apologize, but she feels justified.\n\nFrom her perspective, she's standing up for herself after being disrespected. She put in a lot of work, and the brother's behavior was unkind. However, turning someone away in the rain is harsh, especially if they're family. But there's the argument about mutual respect. Did she have the right to expect timely arrival and respectful communication? She set boundaries, and when they were crossed, she decided to cut ties for the evening. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's behavior was inexcusable. Shouting and using abusive language is unacceptable, but his actions led to the situation. Her response might be seen as fair because she's not responsible for his lateness or his choice to speak disrespectfully. The brother should take responsibility for his actions.\n\nThe community often sides with people who stand up for themselves, especially when there's a history of disrespect. The author's actions were a reaction to being yelled at, which is a valid reason to cut off the interaction. The brother's non-apology only adds to the tension.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she was protecting her own boundaries and well-being after being disrespected. The brother's behavior was the root cause. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
