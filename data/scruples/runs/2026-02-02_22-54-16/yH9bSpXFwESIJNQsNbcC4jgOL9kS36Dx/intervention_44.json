In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. I need to figure out if her actions were justified.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend despite her own busy and broke situation around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule, cleaned, bought food, and prepared the meal. The brother, however, was running late as usual. She had texted him to not be later than 6:30. At 5:30, he said he was running late, and she told him not to be too late. He ended up arriving much later than 6:30, called her a \"prick\" when she interrupted him, and she hung up on him. Then she turned him away, and he claims she shouldn't have done that, even though he apologized with a non-apology.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior. He was disrespectful, used a harsh tone, and she felt that she couldn't accept that. The sister had put in a lot of effort, and the brother's response was not in line with a respectful relationship. She turned him away because he was disrespectful, not just because of his lateness. The brother is now insisting she should apologize, but he didn't properly apologize for his actions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister had a right to set boundaries. She was being treated disrespectfully, and she couldn't be expected to host someone who spoke to her that way. The brother's lateness was an issue, but the main problem was his response when confronted. The sister's reaction to his disrespect was justified. Turning him away in the rain was a consequence of his actions, not just because he was late. So, the sister isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and not tolerating disrespect.\n"
