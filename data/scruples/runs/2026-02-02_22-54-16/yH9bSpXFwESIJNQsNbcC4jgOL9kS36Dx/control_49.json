In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he showed up late and got angry. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after initially hesitating because she's broke and busy during Christmas. She adjusted her schedule and even texted him to not be later than 6:30. The brother said he was running late at 5:30, which she expected. Then, at 7:30, he called explaining he was still on the bus, she interrupted, he yelled at her, which is unusual for their relationship. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something better to do, leading him to turn back in the cold and then give a non-apology.\n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. The sister's perspective is that she put in a lot of effort, was being respectful when she asked about the time, and was wronged by his yelling. She felt justified in her response because of the disrespect. The brother, on the other hand, thinks she was wrong to turn him away in the cold, even if he was rude. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The sister was stressed, had made accommodations, and the brother's yelling crossed a line. His behavior was inappropriate, especially since she's his older sister and they don't usually interact like that. She had the right to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, she did agree to host them, and maybe she overreacted by sending them away. But given the disrespectful outburst, it's understandable she wanted to cut things off. The brother's insistence on her apologizing for turning him away in the cold, while his own actions were the trigger, seems to shift the blame. \n\nThe sister's actions were a response to being yelled at, which is a valid reason to end the interaction. The brother's fault is in the yelling and not respecting her time. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
