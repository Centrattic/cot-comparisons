In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister who agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already stressed because she was broke and busy, but she did arrange the time. The brother was late, and when she called him out on being late, he shouted at her. She got angry, hung up, and then he ended up not coming because it was raining. He's upset that she turned him away in the cold.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author did agree to cook lunch after initially declining, which shows she was trying to be helpful. She communicated her time constraints and even adjusted her schedule. The brother, on the other hand, was late again, which the author mentions is typical. But when she asked him when he'd be there, he yelled at her. That's a big deal because yelling is disrespectful. The author clearly felt disrespected and didn't want to have dinner with someone who spoke to her like that. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted? She hung up on him, which could be seen as petty. Also, when he turned up later, it was raining, and she didn't let him in. Was that justified? He was already on the way, and she might have felt it was too late or inconvenient to let him in after the argument. However, turning him away in the cold might be harsh. But considering the outburst he had, maybe she had a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe brother is asking her to apologize for something he did wrong (yelling), but she's not willing to because he didn't properly apologize. He's saying that turning him away in the rain is worse than his outburst. But from her perspective, his behavior was the root issue. \n\nI think the key points here are mutual expectations and respect. The brother respected her time and effort but didn't consider her feelings when he yelled. The author, in response, set a boundary by not letting him in, which could be seen as a consequence of his actions. However, maybe she could have handled it differently, like letting him in but not having dinner together. But given the situation, she might feel justified in her actions. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She had a right to be upset by his yelling and chose not to have dinner with him because of that. The brother's behavior was disrespectful, and her reaction was a way to protect her own peace. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
