In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. The situation involves the brother being late, getting angry, and the author deciding not to let him in after he arrived late and then gave a non-apology.\n\nFirst, the author had already been stressed, was broke, and had planned the meal around the brother possibly being late. The brother ended up being even later, got angry during the call, and used harsh language. The author felt disrespected and hung up, then sent a text. When the brother arrived late, he was cold and wet, but the author turned him away. The brother is now saying the author should apologize, but she's unwilling.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The brother's behavior was disrespectful, which is a key point. The author had made efforts to accommodate him, but the brother's actions crossed a line. The author's reaction was to protect herself from further disrespect. However, turning someone away in the cold might seem harsh, but given the context, maybe it's understandable. The author is standing up for herself, which is important. On the other hand, the brother is hurt because he's cold and wet, but his own actions led to that situation. \n\nThe key question is whether the author overstepped. The brother's outburst and refusal to apologize might justify her actions. She had communicated her distress and set boundaries. The brother's subsequent behavior didn't show remorse, so the author's decision to enforce the boundary makes sense. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
