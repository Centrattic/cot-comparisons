In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the sister is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after an argument. First, I need to look at the details of the situation.\n\nSo, the sister initially agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She was busy and broke, but still made the effort. She called him in the morning to confirm the time, he said 6 PM. She emphasized he should be on time. He was running late, which isn't unusual for him, so she planned accordingly. Then he called at 7:30, shouting at her, and she hung up. He was nearby but in the rain. She refused to let him in, and he left. Now they're arguing about who's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's disrespectful behavior when he called. He shouted at her, called her a \"prick,\" which is uncharacteristic for their relationship. The sister felt that this was unacceptable and that she had the right to set boundaries. She was cooking a meal that she now wasted. The brother thinks she shouldn't have turned him away in the cold, while she believes his disrespect was worse.\n\nFrom a standpoint of respect and personal boundaries, I think the sister had the right to hang up when he spoke to her that way. No one should tolerate being shouted at, regardless of family ties. However, some might argue that she could have handled it differently, like not turning him away after he had already arrived, even if he was late and rude.\n\nBut the sister's main issue was the brother's disrespectful communication. She had already made compromises (adjusting her time, cooking despite being busy) and his response was unkind. Turning him away could be seen as standing up for herself, but maybe there was a better way to handle the situation without leaving him in the rain. However, considering the context of the disrespect, her actions seem justified. The brother's non-apology also adds to the tension. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother's behavior was clearly inconsiderate and disrespectful. The sister had the right to set boundaries. While she might have handled the aftermath differently (like offering to let him in quietly after the argument), the initial action of hanging up and not letting him in after such a harsh interaction seems defensible. The key is whether the sister's actions were a reasonable response to the brother's unacceptable behavior. I think they were, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
