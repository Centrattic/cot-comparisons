In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, an older sister, agreed to cook a meal for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already busy and broke, but she made time and prepared the meal. The brother asked if 6 PM was okay, which the author agreed to. Then he called to say he was running late, and she warned him not to be too late. At 7:30 PM, he called again and was shouting at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him he shouldn't have made her cook for him under those circumstances. The brother then went to her house but turned back in the rain, and she won't apologize.\n\nFirst, the author tried to accommodate her brother. She adjusted her schedule and spent time and money preparing the meal. The brother's behavior, however, was disrespectful\u2014he shouted at her. The author's response was to cut off the interaction, which she felt justified because of his tone. The brother now claims that turning him away in the rain is worse than his rude outburst.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Usually, people value respect in relationships. If someone is disrespectful, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author's anger comes from being talked to in a hostile manner, which is a valid reaction. The brother's actions (shouting) were inappropriate, so the author's refusal to let him in isn't necessarily wrong. The brother's insistence on an apology might be because he doesn't see his behavior as wrong, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother did show up, and the author's actions resulted in him being in the cold. But the author had already been disrespected, and the brother didn't apologize. There's a balance between holding someone accountable for their actions and showing compassion. However, in this case, the author's boundary was about respect, which is important. The brother's behavior crossed a line, and the author's response was about maintaining her own dignity, not just about being inconvenienced.\n\nAlso, the author's mention of the food being wasted and donating it shows she's trying to make the best of a bad situation. The brother's main grievance seems to be about the inconvenience he faced, but the author's grievance is about the disrespect. Since respect is a two-way street, and the brother violated that, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. Her reaction was justified given the brother's disrespectful behavior. The brother needs to take responsibility for how he spoke to her. The answer is B.\n"
