In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. The situation involves the brother coming over for lunch, but being late and then yelling. The author hung up and refused to let him in, leading to the brother getting caught in the rain.\n\nFirst, the brother initially agreed to the 6 PM time but kept being late. The author had warned him about being late, and even adjusted plans knowing he might be late. Then when the brother called at 7:30, he was rude and shouted at her. The author felt disrespected and hung up. \n\nThe brother's behavior was disrespectful. The author had put effort into cooking, and being shouted at during that is understandable to be upsetting. The key point is that the brother was the one who escalated the situation with his tone. The author's response was to protect their own boundaries, which is valid. \n\nThe brother now wants an apology from the author, but the issue seems to stem from his own actions. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after being disrespected. Also, the brother's non-apology doesn't help. The author's decision to not let him in after the shouting is about self-respect, not the brother's convenience. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had every right to defend their own dignity and were clear about their expectations.\n"
