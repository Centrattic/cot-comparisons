In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's an older sister, agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already stressed because of being broke and busy, but she managed to rearrange her schedule. She called him in the morning to confirm the time, and he said 6 o'clock. But the author knew he was often late, so she planned for that. She even texted him not to be later than 6:30. Then, when he was running late again, she was okay with it. But then at 7:30, he called and was still on the bus. She interrupted him, he shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up on him, sent a text saying he should find something else if it's so inconvenient, and turned him away. Now he's upset and says she was wrong for turning him away in the rain, but she thinks he was wrong for shouting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The brother initially asked for lunch, but he kept being late. The sister made an effort to accommodate his lateness by adjusting her schedule. Then, when he was even later, he shouted at her. That seems like a breach of respect. The sister then decided not to let him in. The brother is upset because of the food and the cold, but the sister was upset about the disrespect. \n\nOn one hand, the sister had invested time and money into cooking for them. She had planned for potential lateness, but the brother's behavior escalated the situation. His shouting was unprovoked and hostile. The sister's reaction was to cut off the conversation and refuse to let them in. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother arrived late and in bad weather. Maybe he had a valid reason for being late, but his response of shouting was inappropriate. The sister might have escalated things by hanging up and turning them away, especially considering the weather and the effort she had put in. However, the brother's disrespect seems to be the key issue here. \n\nThe sister's main grievance was the shouting, which she found unacceptable. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries. The brother's behavior was inconsiderate and rude. However, she could have handled it differently, like asking him to apologize or not allowing him in without being confrontational. But given the circumstances, her actions seem justified because she set the boundaries and the brother broke them. \n\nThe brother's insistence that she should apologize might be because he feels the food was wasted, but he was the one who caused the conflict. The sister's priority was her own peace and the respect she expected, which is valid. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the sister's actions were a reaction to the brother's disrespect. She had the right to set boundaries and decide not to let them in after the shouting. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
