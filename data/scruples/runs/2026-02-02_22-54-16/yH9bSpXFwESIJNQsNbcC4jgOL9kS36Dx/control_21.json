In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The sister initially agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend. She was busy and broke but still made time. She warned him not to be late, and he was. Then he got really rude, shouting at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him he should find another place to eat. He then showed up late but left because it was raining and cold. He's upset she didn't let him in.\n\nFirst, the brother's behavior: shouting and being disrespectful. The sister says she doesn't tolerate that. That's a valid point. People have different boundaries, and if he crossed hers, that's on him. But maybe the sister could have handled it better. She did warn him about the timing. When he was late again, she was frustrated. Then he yelled, so she hung up. That's understandable given the disrespect.\n\nShe turned him away when he arrived late. He was already in the area, but maybe she felt she had put in so much effort and his disrespect was the last straw. He argues she shouldn't have turned him away, but she felt her time and effort were disrespected. The food was wasted, which is sad, but maybe he should have been more respectful from the start.\n\nThe key points are: Did she have a right to set her boundaries? Yes, especially after being yelled at. Was he in the wrong for his behavior? Definitely. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
