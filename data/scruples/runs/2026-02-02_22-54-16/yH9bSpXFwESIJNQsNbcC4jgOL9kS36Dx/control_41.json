In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the sister is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. First, I need to look at the context. She agreed to cook lunch after initially hesitating because of her financial and time constraints around Christmas. She made arrangements and even adjusted her plans because she knew her brother might be late.\n\nThen, her brother was late again, which is typical, but when she called him out, he used harsh language. She hung up and told him to find another meal. The key points here are the brother's disrespectful behavior and the sister's reaction. The brother was on his way, but when she turned him away, he ended up caught in the rain. She doesn't regret her decision because of his attitude.\n\nThe user wants to know if she's wrong. The sister's main justification is the brother's disrespectful communication. The brother, however, thinks being turned away in the cold is worse. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, family dynamics, and what's acceptable. Shouting and using such language is clearly inappropriate. People have different thresholds for confrontation, but the sister's reaction to being yelled at is understandable. She had invested time and effort, and the brother's disrespect crossed a line. \n\nHowever, turning him away when he was nearby and in the rain might be seen as harsh. But given the context of the brother's behavior, her decision to set a boundary might be justified. The sister's actions were a response to disrespect, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a standpoint of respecting others' boundaries and not tolerating abuse, she's not in the wrong. The brother's actions started the conflict. But there's also the aspect of family and kindness, but the sister's reaction was to her brother's provocation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she stood up for herself against disrespectful treatment. However, some might argue that family should be more forgiving. But given the brother's initial disrespect, her action is defensible.\n"
