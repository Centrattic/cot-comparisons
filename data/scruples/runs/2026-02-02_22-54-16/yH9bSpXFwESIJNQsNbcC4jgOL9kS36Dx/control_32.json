In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by turning her brother away in the rain. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the sister agreed to cook dinner for her brother and his girlfriend after initially hesitating because she was busy and broke around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule and made plans for 6 PM. The brother, who's known for being late, asked for 6 PM but then said he was running late again. She warned him not to be too late. He ended up calling at 7:30, shouting \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK,\" which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him he should find another place to eat if he's going to be that rude. He left in the cold and rain, then gave a non-apology. She won't apologize, and he's insisting she should.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. She made an effort to accommodate him, even adjusting her schedule. He came late and was disrespectful. She set boundaries by refusing to be talked to that way. He chose to leave in the rain, and she didn't let him in after he was rude. \n\nOn one hand, she did agree to cook for him, which took a lot of her time and money. His rudeness was unprovoked, and she had every right to ask him to leave if he was being disrespectful. She also gave him multiple chances, considering his history of lateness. \n\nOn the other hand, he did come in the rain and was cold, but he was already late and disrespectful. She might be seen as being stubborn by not letting things slide, but she's maintaining her own standards of respect. \n\nThe brother's behavior was inconsiderate, and she had the right to set boundaries. The fact that he was already late and then shouted at her justifies her reaction. She didn't force him to come, and he chose to come late. So, she's not wrong for standing up for herself. The answer is B.\n"
