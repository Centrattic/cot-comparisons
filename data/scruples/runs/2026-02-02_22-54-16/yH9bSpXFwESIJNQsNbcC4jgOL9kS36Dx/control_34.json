In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the brother asked for lunch, and the author initially said no but then agreed after some back and forth. The author mentions being broke and busy during the holidays, which adds context about their stress. The brother was supposed to come at 6, but he was running late, which the author already anticipated. However, when the brother called at 7:30, the author was cooking and he shouted at her, leading to a conflict. The author hung up and sent a text, and then the brother ended up turning back because it was raining and cold. Now, the brother is upset and wants an apology, but the author refuses, feeling justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior during the phone call. The author says that the brother shouted at her, which wasn't typical for their relationship. The author felt disrespected and hung up, which led to the brother not showing up. The brother is now upset because she turned him away in the cold. The author is upset about the wasted food and the brother's non-apology.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The brother's outburst was unprovoked and disrespectful, which is a big deal. The author had put in a lot of effort to prepare the meal, knowing the brother might be late. When someone is spoken to that way, especially if it's not part of their usual dynamic, it's reasonable to feel hurt and defensive. The author's reaction\u2014hanging up and then not letting the brother come over\u2014seems like a response to the disrespect, not just the lateness. \n\nBut the brother did get caught in the rain and had to go home, which is a negative outcome. However, the author's primary issue was the brother's shouting and the disrespect. The brother's lateness, while inconsiderate, was something the author had already planned for. The shouting tipped the scales for the author. \n\nThe brother's non-apology also doesn't help. He's focusing on the author turning him away in the cold, while the author is focusing on the disrespect. The author's refusal to apologize is because they feel the brother's actions were the main issue. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author's actions were a reaction to the brother's disrespectful behavior. The author had a right to feel disrespected and set a boundary. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The brother's behavior was the root cause here. The fact that the author was already stressed about the meal and the weather adds to the situation. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that turning someone away in the cold isn't ideal. However, given the context of the argument and the brother's behavior, the author's decision to not let him in makes sense. The author's main point is about respecting each other's boundaries and treating each other with respect. The brother's outburst was the trigger for the author's actions. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the brother's disrespectful behavior, the author's reaction is justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
