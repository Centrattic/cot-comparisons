In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he yelled at her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister agreed to cook a meal for her brother and his girlfriend, knowing she was busy and broke during the holidays. She even adjusted her schedule to accommodate his initial request. She communicated clearly about the timing, and when he was late, she was understanding but set boundaries. \n\nThen, when she was on the phone with him and he shouted an insult, she hung up and sent a text that was dismissive. He then showed up late, got cold and wet, and she turned him away. He's upset and says that was worse than his yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations and respect. The sister made an effort to prepare a meal, communicated her boundaries, and was clear about the time. The brother, on the other hand, was late despite being warned, got angry, and used disrespectful language. The sister's reaction to that disrespect is crucial here. \n\nIn most relationships, how people communicate with each other matters a lot. If someone is disrespectful, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The sister was clear that she wouldn't tolerate that kind of treatment. She also didn't want to spend time with someone who's disrespectful, which is valid. \n\nHowever, turning someone away in the cold might be seen as cutting off an opportunity for reconciliation or resolving the conflict. But given the brother's behavior\u2014yelling and not taking responsibility\u2014it might be justified for the sister to prioritize her own comfort and the respect she deserves. \n\nThe sister's main point is that she made a sacrifice to prepare the meal, and the brother's disrespect and lateness made it impossible for her to continue. She's also offering the leftovers to those in need, which shows she's not the one being inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering all that, it seems the sister is not in the wrong. The brother's actions were disrespectful and unconsidered, and her response was a result of standing up for herself. So the answer is B.\n"
