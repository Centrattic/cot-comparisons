In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a sister who agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She mentions she's broke and busy around Christmas, so she had to adjust her schedule to make it work. She had a casual conversation with her brother in the morning, confirming the time as 6 PM. She prepared everything, even texting him to not be late because she put in a lot of effort. Then he called to say he was running late again. She was okay with that but then at 7:30 PM, he was still on the bus. She called him, and he shouted at her, which she finds unacceptable. She hung up, told him he should find something else if he's going to treat her that way. Then he was nearby, got cold and wet, turned back, and gave a non-apology. She's upset and doesn't want to apologize, but he thinks she's wrong for turning him away in the rain. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, breaking it down. The key points here are the brother's behavior and the author's response. The brother had a history of being late and maybe not respecting her time. She made an effort to accommodate him despite her own constraints. When he was late again, she was patient until he shouted at her. That's when she cut things off. He then showed up late, got turned away, got cold and wet, and gave a non-apology. She's holding firm because of his disrespectful behavior.\n\nPossible angles: Did she have a right to set a boundary after being disrespected? Or did she overreact by turning him away? The brother's actions of shouting might have been the catalyst. The author's response was to end the interaction, which he now sees as harsh. She's arguing that his disrespect was worse than the outcome of him being in the cold. \n\nFactors to consider: The brother's history of being late might have been a known issue, but that doesn't justify his outburst. The author had warned him not to be late, and he didn't heed it. When he did show up late, the communication broke down. She felt disrespected and decided to cut ties, which might be reasonable. However, turning him away in the rain could be seen as a harsh reaction, especially if he was already there. But his behavior might have justified her actions. \n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. She agreed to cook at 6 PM, but he kept changing the time. She had planned around his likely lateness. But when he actually showed up late and was disrespectful, she had to make a choice. Her decision to end the meal was after his insult. So, maybe her boundary was appropriate. The brother's non-apology complicates things. She might not be in the wrong because she was standing up for herself after being mistreated. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have handled it differently. Maybe she should have let him come in to apologize properly instead of cutting him off. However, the author felt that the respect was missing. The key issue here is the brother's disrespectful behavior and the sister's response. If the brother had a history of being inconsiderate, her reaction might be justified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she could have handled the situation better without turning him away in the rain. But given that he was already there and had been disrespectful, she might have felt it was necessary to enforce her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting someone while they're cooking and being shouted at is not acceptable. The sister's reaction was to protect her own well-being, which is valid. The brother's expectation that she should apologize for standing up for herself might indicate that he's not taking accountability for his actions. \n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions were a response to disrespect, and she tried to set boundaries. While turning someone away in the rain isn't ideal, the context of the brother's behavior might make her the right party here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
