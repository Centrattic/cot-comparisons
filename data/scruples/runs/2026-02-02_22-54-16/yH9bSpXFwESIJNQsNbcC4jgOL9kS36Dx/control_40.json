In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend during a busy and broke time before Christmas. She rearranged her schedule and even texted him to not be late. He was late, she told him to not be too late, and then when he called at 7:30 to explain, he yelled at her, \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK.\" She hung up and told him to find something better to do if he's going to be inconvenient. He ended up not coming, went home in the cold and rain, and now he's upset that she turned him away, claiming it's worse than his insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The sister was already stressed, broke, and busy. She made an effort to accommodate her brother after initially declining, which shows she was willing to adjust. She communicated her need for punctuality, especially when she's already making an effort. When the brother was late again, she had already planned for possible delays. But his response of yelling was inappropriate. In their relationship, if that's not a normal thing, then it's a big deal. She felt disrespected, so her reaction of hanging up and being firm makes sense.\n\nThen, when he arrived at her house after the argument, she turned him away in the rain. He claims that's worse than his insult. But from her perspective, she was in the middle of cooking, had already invested time and money, and was dealing with someone who just insulted her. Her boundaries were crossed, so she's protecting herself. It's understandable she didn't want to spend time with someone who was disrespectful.\n\nThe key points are the brother's disrespectful behavior. Even if he was late, his yelling was uncalled for. The sister was within her right to set boundaries. Turning him away after that might be a consequence of his actions. Also, she's being asked to apologize for standing up for herself, which is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The brother's actions are the main issue. Answer B.\n"
