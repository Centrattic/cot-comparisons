It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for food and other expenses during a dinner invite.\n\nFirst, consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, it's generally expected that the host is covering the cost. Charging a guest for ingredients might be seen as unusual or unexpected. The friend listed out specific expenses like Uber rides and pasta ingredients. The user felt it was a lot and decided to not go again, which they think is justified.\n\nThe user paid the money but felt it was wrong. The key points here are: 1) The host charged for food, which isn't typical. 2) The amount was higher than expected (25 vs. 10). 3) The user's reaction is to avoid future invitations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about expectations. The host might have considered splitting costs for shared rides, but including the cost of making the meal is less common. The user didn't protest, but their feelings are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. Declining future invites is a personal choice, not a moral wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
