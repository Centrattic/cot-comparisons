It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses. The author paid without objections but feels it's wrong and plans to decline future invitations. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around guests and hosts. Usually, when someone invites you for dinner, it's customary for the host to cover the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for food might be unexpected unless it's a special arrangement. The author might feel that the friend overstepped by itemizing the costs, especially the ingredients.\n\nThe friend listed specific amounts for Uber rides and pasta ingredients. The total came to $25, which the author thought would be around $10. The key points here are the expectation of splitting costs and whether the food charges are reasonable. Shared Uber rides are typically split between friends, but charging for ingredients might not be standard unless agreed upon beforehand. \n\nThe author didn't object immediately, which could be seen as accepting the arrangement, but their feelings of being charged for dinner are valid. Declining future invites shows discomfort, which is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's action might be considered inconsiderate because it's not common to charge a guest for food unless there's a prior agreement. The author's reaction is understandable as they might feel the friend turned a friendly gesture into a transactional one. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The answer should be B (No).\n"
