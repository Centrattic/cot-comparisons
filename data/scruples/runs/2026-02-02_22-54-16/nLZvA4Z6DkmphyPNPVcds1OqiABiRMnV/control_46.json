It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's friend invited them over for dinner, and later charged them for the ingredients used to make the pasta. The friend also charged for Uber rides, which the author was already expecting to pay. The author ended up paying $25 instead of the expected $10 because of the pasta ingredients. Now, the author is conflicted about whether it's normal to be charged for the dinner and if they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's customary that they cover the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be seen as unusual because the host typically absorbs the cost of food as part of the invitation. However, if the friends had an agreement beforehand that expenses would be split, maybe it's different. But the author didn't mention any prior agreement like that. \n\nThe friend charged $13 for ingredients, which seems like a significant portion of the total amount. The author might feel that the meal was a social gesture, not a business transaction. On the other hand, the friend might have felt that since they split Uber costs, splitting the food cost is fair. But splitting Uber is different because it's a direct shared expense, whereas the food is part of the host's hospitality. \n\nAlso, the author didn't object at the time but plans to decline future invites. This shows they feel uncomfortable but didn't address it immediately. Maybe they should have asked for clarification on the food cost earlier. But it's also possible that the friend's approach was inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key points are: whether there was an expectation of splitting costs, the cultural norms around hospitality, and how the friend handled the situation. Since there's no mention of prior agreement, the friend charging for ingredients might be the issue here. The author's reaction is understandable because expecting to pay for food when invited over is not typical in many cultures. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
