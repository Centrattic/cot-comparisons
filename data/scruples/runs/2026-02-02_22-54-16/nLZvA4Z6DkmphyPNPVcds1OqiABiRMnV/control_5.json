It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for being upset that their friend charged them for the ingredients used in a pasta dinner.\n\nSo, the situation: The friend invited them over, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The person thought it was odd because they expected a small amount for shared Uber rides but got charged $13 for the ingredients. They paid without objection but are considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to think about social norms. Usually, when someone invites someone else for dinner, the host covers the cost unless it's agreed otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs, which isn't typical in casual friendships. It might come off as transactional where a personal gesture became a business deal.\n\nThe friend listed out all the expenses, including Uber and ingredients. The person is upset because they didn't expect to pay for the food. Maybe the friend expected them to contribute to the shared cost, but the guest wasn't aware of that. The problem here is communication. If the friend had mentioned beforehand that they'd split the costs, the person might have been okay with it. But since it came up after, it feels like an afterthought or a surprise bill.\n\nAlso, the amount for ingredients\u2014$13 for pasta ingredients seems high. Pasta is usually simple, so maybe the friend overestimated or included other expenses. The person might feel it's unreasonable to charge for something that's part of the dinner invitation.\n\nHowever, the person didn't object immediately. They paid without a fight but are now planning to decline future invites. Is that justified? They are within their rights to be upset if they didn't agree to splitting costs. But maybe they should have asked or discussed it before. If the friend didn't mention charging for ingredients, the person might not have known. But if the friend just listed it without prior discussion, that's where the issue lies.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some. The friend might have miscommunicated the expectation. The person might have assumed it was a free dinner. But the person isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable with being charged for something they didn't expect. The key point is whether the friend should have set that expectation beforehand. If not, then the friend might be in the wrong. But the person's reaction of declining future invites is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The friend might have been at fault for not setting clear expectations. The answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
