It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their friend charged them for a dinner they had. So the author was invited over for pasta, and later the friend asked for $25 back, including $13 for the ingredients. The author thought it was weird and now might stop accepting invites.\n\nFirst, I need to recall social norms around splitting costs. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, especially as a friend, it's considered their treat. They might expect to cover the cost themselves as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients could be seen as splitting costs, but maybe the amount is an issue. \n\nThe friend listed specific amounts for Ubers and ingredients. The Ubers part is more understandable\u2014splitting shared expenses like rides. But the $13 for pasta ingredients might be tricky. If they're close friends, splitting the cost of ingredients might not be the norm. It could depend on how they usually handle things. If they've split costs before, maybe it's okay, but if not, the author might feel it's unexpected. \n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but feels it's wrong. They're considering not going next time. Is the author justified? The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for dinner, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nIn some cultures, splitting the cost of a meal when you invite someone is common, but other times it's a favor. If the friend had made it clear beforehand that they'd split the cost, maybe it's fair. But since it was after the fact, the author might not have expected it. Also, $13 for pasta ingredients seems high. How much pasta, sauce, etc., do you really need? Maybe the friend overestimated or the cost is unreasonable. \n\nSo the author's reaction is about being charged for dinner, which they might see as a social obligation rather than a shared expense. Declining future invites is a possible response if they feel uncomfortable. The key is whether expecting to be charged for hospitality is unreasonable. If the friend didn't mention it beforehand, the author's feelings are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, so the answer would be B.\n"
