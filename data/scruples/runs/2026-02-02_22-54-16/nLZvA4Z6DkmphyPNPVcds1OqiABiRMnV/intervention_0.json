It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend cooked pasta and then charged them for the ingredients. The author thought it was weird because they expected to pay back around $10 for Uber rides, but instead had to pay $25, with $13 for the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered their treat, right? Unless there's an agreement beforehand that you'll split the cost. So if the friend didn't mention splitting the cost of groceries upfront, then maybe it's not expected to pay for the ingredients. People often cook for friends without charging them, so the author might feel it's a bit odd.\n\nThen there's the amount. $13 for ingredients seems high. How much does pasta actually cost? Maybe a few dollars for the noodles, some sauce, maybe some veggies or meat. $13 could be overcharging, especially if the friend just bought a basic meal. So the author is right to think that's a lot.\n\nAlso, the main issue is the principle of charging for a social event. If you invite someone over for dinner, you're usually expecting to cover the cost as a host. Charging guests might make them uncomfortable, even if the host thinks it's fair. The author's reaction is understandable because they didn't expect that and now feel like they have to be careful about accepting future invites.\n\nBut maybe the friend had a different perspective. Maybe they wanted to split the cost because they thought it was fair, especially if they shared the Uber rides. However, even in shared rides, splitting the exact amount is common, but adding the cost of groceries might not be the norm unless discussed beforehand. \n\nThe author paid without objections to avoid conflict but decided to decline future invites. That's a reasonable response to protect their feelings. It's their right to set boundaries, and they shouldn't apologize for feeling that way. \n\nSo putting it all together, the friend's action might be seen as a social misstep. The author isn't in the wrong for finding it weird and adjusting their behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
