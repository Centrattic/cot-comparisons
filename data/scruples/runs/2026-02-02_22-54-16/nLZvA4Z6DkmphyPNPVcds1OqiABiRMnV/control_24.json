It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for the ingredients might come off as unexpected, especially if there was no prior discussion about splitting costs. The writer expected to pay back for shared Uber rides but wasn't anticipating paying for the pasta ingredients. \n\nThe amount charged for the pasta is $13. Depending on what the ingredients actually cost, $13 might be reasonable or not. If it's just basic pasta ingredients, that could be a bit high. But maybe it was a special dish with more expensive items. However, the key issue is the expectation. In most social contexts, friends don't charge each other for meals unless they've discussed it beforehand. \n\nThe writer didn't object and paid, but their feelings are valid. They might feel that their friend is treating the interaction like a transaction, which can strain friendships. The friend's approach could be seen as inconsiderate because it's not customary to split food costs unless agreed upon. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend had asked if they wanted to split the cost of ingredients, maybe the writer would have been okay with it. But since there was no prior communication, the friend's action could be seen as impolite. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The friend's action is more questionable here. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
