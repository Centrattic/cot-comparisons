It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a friend charging them for food during a dinner invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend invited the user for dinner and made pasta. Later, when the user was paying back money for shared Uber rides, the friend added 13 dollars for the pasta ingredients. The user found this weird and plans to decline future dinner invitations.\n\nSo, the main points are: 1. Charging for food at a social dinner is unusual. 2. The amount charged seems high. 3. The user paid without objection but feels hurt.\n\nI should consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest for ingredients is not common unless it's a business arrangement. The friend might have expected splitting costs for shared expenses like rides, but food is usually the host's responsibility. \n\nAlso, the user didn't object, which might imply they didn't want to conflict, but their intention to stop attending future dinners shows they felt wronged. The user's feelings are valid if they expected the meal to be free. However, maybe the friend had a different expectation, thinking they should split all expenses. \n\nThe key issue is whether charging for food is acceptable. In most social contexts, the host covers their own meal costs. Charging a guest could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's action is questionable, so the author isn't the one at fault.\n"
