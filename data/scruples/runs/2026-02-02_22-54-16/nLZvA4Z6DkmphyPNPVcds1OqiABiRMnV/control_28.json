It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner ingredients. The situation is that the friend invited them over for a pasta dinner, and later when settling up for shared Uber rides, the friend added $13 for the ingredients. The author felt it was a lot more than expected and plans to decline future dinner invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting costs for social gatherings. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, it's expected that the host covers the cost of the food. Charging a guest for ingredients can be seen as unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The author didn't expect to be charged for the pasta, which was part of the social event, so their confusion and hurt feelings are understandable.\n\nThe friend listed the Uber expenses and the ingredients. The Uber part might be more straightforward\u2014shared rides are usually split, so that's fair. But the ingredients are part of the meal, which is a bit different. If it's a regular thing where they both contribute to meals, maybe splitting costs makes sense. But the author didn't mention any prior arrangement about splitting food costs. So the friend might have overstepped by expecting payment for the pasta ingredients without discussing it beforehand.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction is to decline future invites, which is a personal choice. They might feel that the friend is being transactional where it's supposed to be a friendly gesture. The key point here is the expectation. If the host usually splits costs, maybe it's okay, but if not, it's considered odd. \n\nI should also think about cultural context. In some places, it's common to chip in for ingredients when cooking together, but in others, it's not. Since the author didn't mention any prior discussions, it's likely they expected the host to cover the meal. The friend's approach might come off as abrupt or inconsiderate, making the author feel like their friendship is being treated as a business transaction. \n\nThe author didn't object when paying, but their internal reaction is important. They might be overthinking, but the feeling of being charged for a social meal without prior notice is a common grievance. The answer would depend on whether splitting food costs was a known norm between them. Since the post doesn't indicate that, the author's reaction seems justified. So, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
