It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for food they cooked during dinner. The friend invited them over, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The user is confused because they expected a smaller amount but got $25, which included the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually a friendly gesture, and expecting the guest to pay for the meal might be seen as odd. However, if the meal was part of a shared expense or if there was a prior agreement to split costs, that's different. But in this case, the author wasn't expecting to pay for the pasta ingredients. The friend listed the ingredients as part of the debt from shared Uber rides, which seems like combining different expenses without prior discussion.\n\nThe user didn't object at the time, which might be because they didn't want to cause a scene. But their intention to decline future invites suggests they felt it was unfair. The key points here are whether the friend was reasonable in charging for the meal and if the author's reaction is justified.\n\nCharging for the ingredients could be seen as splitting costs, but in a casual friend setting, this isn't typical unless agreed upon beforehand. The amount of $13 for pasta ingredients might also be on the higher side depending on what was bought, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, the main issue is the expectation of being charged for a meal that was meant to be a favor or hospitality.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's approach of billing them for the meal wasn't customary unless previously discussed. The friend might have overstepped by including the meal costs in a shared expense without clear communication. The author's discomfort is valid, and their decision to decline future invitations is a personal choice to avoid similar situations.\n"
