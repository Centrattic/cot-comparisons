It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author expected to pay back around $10 for shared Ubers but ended up paying $25 because the friend added the cost of the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary to split the cost if agreed in advance, but charging for ingredients might be unexpected. The key points here are whether the friend communicated the expectation of reimbursement for ingredients beforehand and the reasonableness of the amount.\n\nThe author didn't mention prior agreement to split the cost of groceries. If the friend didn't mention that they'd be charging for ingredients when they invited them, the author might feel it's unfair. Also, the amount for ingredients ($13) seems significant compared to the Uber costs. People often don't expect to pay for groceries unless it's a shared expense arrangement.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's approach. Charging for ingredients could be seen as transactional, which might make the interaction less about friendship and more about splitting costs. Friends sometimes cover expenses without expecting exact repayment, so the author's discomfort is understandable.\n\nHowever, the author paid without protest, which shows they might not think they're right to be upset. But they're considering not attending future dinners, which is a reaction to feeling wronged. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for ingredients without prior discussion. \n\nIn many social contexts, it's assumed that when you host someone, the host covers the cost unless specified otherwise. The friend might have felt they needed to split all expenses, including ingredients, but the author wasn't aware of this. So the friend might have breached the social norm by charging without prior agreement.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. The friend's action of charging for ingredients after the fact without prior discussion is the issue here. The author's reaction is a valid response to an unexpected and possibly unfair request. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
