It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user's friend invited them over for dinner and made pasta. Then later, when they met up again, the friend charged them $25 for shared Uber rides and the ingredients. The user is confused because they expected around $10. They paid without objection but now feel weird about it and might decline future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites a friend over for dinner, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality. The host typically covers the cost of the meal as part of the invitation. If the host expects the guest to pay for the ingredients, that might be unusual unless it's a specific agreement beforehand. \n\nThe Uber rides are a shared expense, so splitting those costs makes sense. But charging for the ingredients is questionable. Friends often split costs when they go out together, like splitting a restaurant bill, but when the host cooks at home, the expectation is usually that the host pays for the meal. Unless they had a prior agreement that they would split all costs, including groceries, the friend might have overstepped.\n\nThe user's reaction seems reasonable. They paid to keep the peace but are upset about the charge for dinner. Deciding not to accept future invitations if the same pattern continues is a personal choice, and they have the right to set that boundary. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Probably not. The friend might have been inconsiderate by charging for the pasta ingredients, especially without prior discussion. Socially, it's customary for the host to cover the cost of the meal when hosting. So the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
