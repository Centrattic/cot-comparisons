It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food during a dinner. The friend invited them over, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The user feels it's weird and might stop attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around sharing meals. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality, and the host covers the cost as a courtesy. Charging a guest for the ingredients might be seen as transactional, which could be unexpected or unwelcome. \n\nThen there's the amount charged. The friend listed specific costs: Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The user expected around $10 but was asked for $25. The ingredients part being $13 might be the main issue here. If the pasta was a simple dish, $13 for ingredients could be seen as excessive, especially if the user wasn't expecting to pay for groceries. \n\nThe user didn't object and paid without protest. That's probably out of politeness, but their feeling of being upset and planning to decline future invites suggests they felt it was unfair. The key points are whether splitting costs for shared Uber rides is normal (which it often is) and whether charging for a meal someone is invited to is standard. \n\nIn social contexts, splitting costs for shared expenses like rides is common, but expecting to split the cost of a meal the host prepared might not be. The host could have mentioned splitting costs beforehand, but if they didn't, the guest might not expect it. The user's reaction seems reasonable because the situation wasn't clearly outlined. \n\nAlso, the user's intention to decline future invitations if charged again shows they feel the arrangement isn't friendly. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the costs, making it feel like a business transaction rather than a social visit. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They had a valid expectation that the dinner was a favor, and the friend's approach might have been too transactional. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
