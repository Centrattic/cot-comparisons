It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when friends have dinner, it's common to assume that the host provides the food as part of the social visit. Charging for ingredients might not be the norm. The friend charged $13 for pasta ingredients. That seems high unless they're using expensive, specialty items. Maybe the ingredients are basic, so $13 could be overpriced.\n\nThe person writing the post didn't object at the time but felt uncomfortable later. They're considering not attending future dinners. The key points here are about social expectations and fairness. If the friend had mentioned splitting costs beforehand, that would be clear. But since it came up later, it might feel like an afterthought or a way to cover extra costs, which can be awkward.\n\nAlso, splitting Uber rides is different from charging for groceries. Uber is a shared expense, but food is part of the invitation. Charging for groceries could be seen as expected if agreed upon, but if not discussed, it's a surprise. The writer didn't react at the time, which might mean they felt pressured to pay without discussion. \n\nSo, the friend might have overstepped by charging for groceries without prior agreement. The writer's discomfort is understandable. They're not being petty; they're reacting to an unexpected charge. Declining future invitations is a reasonable response if they feel it's a recurring issue. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
