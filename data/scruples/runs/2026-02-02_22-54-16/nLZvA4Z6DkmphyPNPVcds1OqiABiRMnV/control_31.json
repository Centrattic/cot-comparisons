It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation involves a friend who invited them over for dinner, then later charged them for the ingredients. The friend also listed other expenses like Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually expected that they cover the cost themselves unless there's prior agreement otherwise. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as unexpected because the host typically pays for their own expenses when hosting. The author might feel that the host shouldn't pass on the cost to the guest unless it's a shared expense arrangement.\n\nThe friend charged $13 for ingredients. Let's think about whether splitting costs for a dinner is common. If the dinner is a social event, the host usually covers it as a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest could be seen as transactional, which might make the interaction feel less friendly. The Uber charges are split, which is more understandable as shared expenses, but the food cost is the main issue.\n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but feels justified in declining future invites. The question is whether the author is at fault. The friend might not be in the wrong if she believed that expenses should be split, but the host usually covers their own costs. The author's reaction is about discomfort with being charged for something typically considered a favor. So the author isn't wrong for feeling that way. The answer should be B (No).\n"
