It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend made pasta dinner and later charged them $13 for ingredients. The user paid without objections but is now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary that they cover the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest for the ingredients might be seen as unusual. However, if the friend mentioned beforehand that they would split the cost, that's different. But in this case, they didn't. The friend listed the charges after the fact, including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients.\n\nThe user felt confused because they expected a smaller amount. The key points here are communication and expectations. The friend didn't clarify beforehand that the dinner costs would be split, which led to the user feeling charged unexpectedly. Charging for ingredients could be seen as a bit of a breach in social etiquette since guests aren't typically expected to contribute to the cost of the meal unless agreed upon in advance.\n\nThe user's reaction\u2014paying without argument but deciding to decline future invites\u2014is a common response when someone feels their expectations were not met. It's important to note that the user isn't being petty; they're adjusting their behavior based on this experience. The amount charged for ingredients ($13) might also be a factor. If it's a reasonable estimate of the cost, some might argue it's fair to split, but others might still think it's unusual unless communicated upfront.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's approach might be less social and more transactional. The author's feelings are justified because the expectation wasn't set beforehand. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
