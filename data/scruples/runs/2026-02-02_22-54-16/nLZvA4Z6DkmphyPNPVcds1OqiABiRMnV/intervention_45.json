It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for feeling weird that their friend charged them for dinner. The friend invited them over, made pasta, and later itemized the cost, including ingredients. The user thought maybe splitting Uber rides is normal, but being charged for the meal's ingredients is what's bothering them.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the friend make it clear beforehand that the dinner was a paid thing? The user didn't know they'd be charged for ingredients. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's a kindness, not a business transaction. If the friend had mentioned upfront that they'd need to split the cost of groceries, maybe the user would have been okay with it. But since it came up later as a surprise, that's where the issue lies.\n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients. Pasta isn't super expensive, so $13 seems a bit high. Unless they used a lot of specialty items, but the user didn't mention that. The friend might have miscalculated or included other costs. Either way, expecting the guest to pay for the ingredients might be unreasonable unless agreed upon beforehand.\n\nThe user paid it back without a fight, which is mature, but their reaction of not wanting to go again is understandable. The main question is whether the friend was wrong for charging for the meal. Since the user didn't know, and it's customary for hosts to cover the meal cost when inviting someone over, the friend's approach seems off. So the user isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Answer B.\n"
