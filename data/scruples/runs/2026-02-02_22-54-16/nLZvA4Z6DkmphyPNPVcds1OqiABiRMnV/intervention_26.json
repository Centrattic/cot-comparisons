It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The person expected to pay back around $10 for Ubers but was asked for $25, which included $13 for ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, it's usually considered a gesture of friendship. Charging for the ingredients might be unexpected because the cost of the meal is typically absorbed by the host as part of the hospitality. The Uber charges are more straightforward since those were shared expenses, but the $13 for ingredients feels like splitting costs for a personal expense that's part of the social event.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the amount. $13 for ingredients might be a lot, depending on the actual cost. If the pasta was simple, maybe that's overcharging. But if it used expensive ingredients, maybe it's just right. However, the key issue here is the expectation. The friend probably expected to cover the Uber, which is a shared expense, but the ingredients are part of the dinner they hosted. Charging for that could be seen as making the dinner a transactional thing rather than a friendly gesture.\n\nThe author didn't object and paid, which shows they might feel it's not worth the confrontation, but they're considering not accepting future dinner invites. Their feeling is about the unexpected and possibly excessive charge for a social meal. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. The friend's action is what's questionable here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
