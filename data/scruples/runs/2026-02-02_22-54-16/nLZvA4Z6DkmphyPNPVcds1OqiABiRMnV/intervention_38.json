It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner and later charged them for the ingredients used in the pasta, along with other expenses like Uber rides. The author feels it's weird and plans to decline future dinner invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered their treat. Charging for ingredients might not be typical. But maybe in some contexts, splitting costs is expected. The author didn't object but feels upset now. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend listed out the costs, including the pasta ingredients. The total was higher than expected. The author paid without protest but feels justified in their discomfort. The question is about rightness, not just if it's normal.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because expecting to be reimbursed for ingredients isn't standard. Friends might share expenses like Ubers, but food is often an exception. The author's reaction seems reasonable. However, maybe the friend had a different expectation. But the author's feelings are valid, so answer B.\n"
