It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social norms here. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, is it customary to expect reimbursement for ingredients? From what I know, typically, when you're invited to someone's home for a meal, the host covers the cost. It's part of the hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as expecting reimbursement for shared expenses, but it's not always the norm unless there's an agreement beforehand.\n\nThe user mentions that the friend charged $13 for pasta ingredients. The author is confused because they expected around $10 for Uber. The total came to $25. The key points here are: 1) was the author aware that ingredients would be charged? 2) Is charging for ingredients considered standard in their circle of friends?\n\nIf the friend didn't mention upfront that they would be charged for the meal, then the author's reaction is understandable. It's a bit odd to be asked to pay for the food you're eating, even if it's homemade. However, if the two friends have a history of splitting costs for shared expenses (like Uber), maybe the friend thought it's fair to split the cost of ingredients as well. But even then, it's not common to track every ingredient's cost to the dollar and expect reimbursement unless it's a significant expense.\n\nThe author paid without objections to avoid conflict but plans to decline future invitations. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The author isn't necessarily wrong because social expectations can vary. If the friend made it clear beforehand that they'd be splitting costs, maybe the author should have accepted. But since it was a surprise, the author's discomfort is valid.\n\nAlso, the $13 for pasta ingredients might feel high if the meal was simple. If the ingredients were expensive or if there were leftovers, maybe it's justifiable. But without prior discussion, it's reasonable for the author to feel like it's a bit much. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's approach might be seen as expecting reimbursement for a personal expense, which isn't typically expected in social settings unless agreed upon. The author's decision to decline future invites is a personal choice to avoid similar situations, which is understandable. So the answer should be B.\n"
