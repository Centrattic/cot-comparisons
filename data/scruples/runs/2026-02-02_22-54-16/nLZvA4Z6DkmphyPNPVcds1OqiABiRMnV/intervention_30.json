It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where a friend charged them for dinner. The author is confused because they expected to pay around $10 but ended up paying $25, which included the cost of ingredients. They paid up but feel that the friend might have overcharged and are considering not accepting future dinner invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting costs when a friend invites someone over. Typically, if someone invites you for dinner, it's usually considered their treat. However, if there are shared expenses like Uber rides, splitting those is common. The issue here is the friend charging for the ingredients used in the pasta. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend included $13 for ingredients in the total amount owed. The author feels this is excessive and justifies their feeling of being upset. The question is whether the friend was wrong in charging for the ingredients. \n\nIn many social contexts, when someone invites you for dinner, the host typically covers the cost themselves. Charging the guest for the ingredients might be seen as unusual unless they had a prior agreement to split all costs. The author didn't object at the time but is now considering not attending future dinners, which is a reasonable response if they feel the charges were unfair. \n\nThe author's feelings are justified because the expectation was that the dinner was a gesture of hospitality, and the unexpected charge for ingredients was a surprise. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the costs, especially the ingredients, which aren't typically split unless agreed upon beforehand. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to feel that the charges were unreasonable, and their decision to decline future invitations is a personal choice that doesn't make them at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
