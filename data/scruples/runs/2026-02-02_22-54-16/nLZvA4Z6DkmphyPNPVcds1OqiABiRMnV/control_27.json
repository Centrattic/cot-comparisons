It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after being charged for dinner by a friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author felt confused because they expected a smaller amount and now are considering not accepting future invites.\n\nSo, what's the standard here? If someone invites you over for dinner, is it expected that you pay for the ingredients? I think it's a bit of a gray area. Some people might split the cost of shared expenses, like Uber rides, which the author did. But charging for the food ingredients is another matter. If the friend made the pasta specifically for the dinner, is that considered a personal expense? Typically, when people host, they cover the cost themselves unless they're splitting the bill. Charging for ingredients might come off as being too literal or not considering that hosting is a social gesture where you don't expect reimbursement. \n\nThe author didn't object immediately but paid without complaints. Now they feel resentful. The key points are: 1) Charging for the pasta ingredients, 2) The amount being higher than expected. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend didn't clarify beforehand that they'd charge for the dinner, then charging afterwards could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and planning to decline future invites\u2014is a personal choice based on their discomfort. They didn't argue, just paid. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might have overstepped by expecting payment for the meal. \n\nBut maybe the friend thought they were splitting all shared costs equally. However, splitting Uber rides is common, but food is another matter. Since it's a personal meal, the host usually pays. The friend might have overcharged if they considered the meal a shared expense. So, the author's feelings are justified. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
