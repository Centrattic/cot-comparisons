It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. The friend invited them over and made pasta, then later included the cost of ingredients in the amount owed for shared Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around friends splitting costs. Typically, when friends get together, if one person invites another, it's often understood that the host is covering the meal as a gesture of hospitality. However, the author had already owed the friend money for Uber rides. The friend then added the cost of the pasta's ingredients to the total. The author is now conflicted because they expected the meal to be a kindness, not a debt. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to charge for shared meals. Some people split costs for things like gas or groceries, especially if they're roommates or in a group where everyone contributes. But in a casual friend setting, especially when one person is hosting, it might be different. The key here is the expectation set by the friend. If the friend didn't mention the cost of the meal beforehand, the author might have a right to feel it's unexpected. \n\nAlso, the amount in question is $13 for ingredients. That seems low, but the principle is about whether it's appropriate to charge for a meal when it's a social visit. The author might feel it's like charging for a favor, which could be seen as transactional rather than friendly. \n\nHowever, the author didn't object and just paid. Their intention to decline future invitations shows they're uncomfortable, but maybe they should have discussed it then. Was the friend's approach wrong? Possibly, because maybe they should have discussed splitting the meal cost beforehand. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to pay without argument but now feel the next time they'll decline. The author's feelings are about being charged for a meal, which they didn't expect. If the friend included the meal cost without prior agreement, the author isn't wrong for feeling that way. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had a reasonable expectation that the meal was a social gesture, not a charge. The friend's approach might have been inconsiderate, but the author isn't at fault for their reaction.\n"
