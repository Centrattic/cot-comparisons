It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses during a dinner. The writer is confused because they thought the amount owed was around $10 but it turned out to be $25, including the cost of ingredients for the pasta.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms regarding friends inviting each other over. Typically, when someone invites a friend for dinner, it's customary for the host to cover the cost unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Charging for the ingredients might not be expected unless discussed beforehand. The user paid without objections but feels uneasy about being charged for the meal.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Was there an expectation of splitting costs? 2) Was the friend's action of charging for ingredients reasonable? 3) Did the host overcharge?\n\nIn many cases, people invite friends over as a gesture of hospitality, expecting to cover the meal themselves. However, if there were shared expenses like Uber rides, splitting those makes sense. The issue here is the inclusion of the pasta ingredients. The friend might have felt that since they shared the rides, splitting the cost is fair, but the meal itself is another matter. The total amount being higher than expected could have caused the writer's discomfort.\n\nIs the writer wrong for feeling this way? Probably not. It's reasonable to expect that a host would cover their own meal when inviting someone. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting the cost beyond typical shared expenses. The writer's reaction is about feeling that it's odd to be charged for something that's part of the hospitality. Declining the next invitation is a way to set boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nOn the flip side, the friend might have thought it's fair to split all shared expenses, including the meal. However, the writer didn't specify if there was an agreement beforehand. The friend's action might not be wrong, but it's certainly a difference in expectations. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling this way; they're reacting to unmet expectations. So the answer is B (No).\n"
