It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author feels it's odd and might stop accepting similar invitations next time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites another for dinner, it's generally understood that the host is covering the cost. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as unexpected and possibly inappropriate. The friend itemized costs, which could come off as transactional rather than a friendly gesture. The author's reaction\u2014paying without objection but deciding not to attend again\u2014is reasonable as they might feel it's not a genuine social interaction anymore.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend had a different perspective, thinking they should split costs equally. But the key points are the context of a casual dinner and the amount charged for ingredients. Charging for ingredients isn't common unless agreed beforehand. The author isn't wrong for feeling it's odd and adjusting their behavior accordingly. So the answer is B.\n"
