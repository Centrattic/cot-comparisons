It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later when meeting up again, the friend listed charges for Ubers and ingredients. The author paid without complaints but feels it's a bit much and might decline the next invite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting expenses. When friends have dinner, especially when one cooks, it's common that the host might expect to be reimbursed for their expenses, especially if they mention it beforehand or if it's part of an agreement. However, in this case, the author wasn't informed beforehand that they would be charged for the ingredients. Charging for ingredients might be seen as expecting reimbursement for the cost of the meal, which is a bit different from splitting a shared expense like an Uber ride. \n\nSo, the key points here: the author was invited over for dinner, enjoyed it, but later was surprised by the charge for ingredients. The friend might have considered it as splitting the cost of the meal, but the author didn't expect that. \n\nIn many social contexts, when someone invites you for a meal, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless otherwise agreed. So the friend charging for the ingredients might be seen as going against that norm. However, if they had discussed splitting costs beforehand, maybe it's different. Since the author didn't expect it, their reaction is understandable. \n\nThe author's plan to decline the next invite is a bit of a red flag. Maybe they could have discussed it with the friend first instead of jumping to that conclusion. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about it. They paid the money but felt it was excessive. The answer here would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The friend might have miscalculated or expected reimbursement without prior agreement, which is the friend's issue, not the author's.\n"
