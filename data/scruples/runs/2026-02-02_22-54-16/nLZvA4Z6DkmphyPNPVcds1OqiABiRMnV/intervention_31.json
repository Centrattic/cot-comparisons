It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients. The writer is confused because they thought it was a friendly dinner, not a paid event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend invited the writer for dinner, which is typically seen as a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected. The user says they gave the money without objections but plan to decline future invites. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the writer have prior knowledge that they'd be charged for the food? If the friend didn't mention it beforehand, then the writer wasn't aware. The friend might have expected splitting costs for shared expenses like Uber, but charging for food ingredients is a gray area. \n\nIn many social situations, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The writer might feel it's unfair to charge for the food since it's part of the hospitality. The friend, on the other hand, might see it as splitting the cost equally, but the amount charged (13$ for ingredients) seems a bit high if it's just for one person. \n\nThe writer isn't in the wrong for feeling confused or upset. They didn't know it would be a paid dinner. They also didn't object immediately, which is understandable to avoid conflict. Their intention to decline future invites is a personal choice based on their discomfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They had a reasonable expectation, and the friend's approach was unexpected. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
