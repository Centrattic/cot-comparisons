It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for ingredients when they had dinner together. The key points here are the expectation when a friend invites you over for a meal.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you to dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. So charging for the ingredients might come off as unexpected. The friend split the Uber rides, which makes sense as they were shared costs. But the pasta ingredients were part of the dinner, which is typically the host's expense. \n\nThe author felt it was weird, especially because the total was higher than expected. The friend itemized the charges, which the author found odd. The author didn't object to pay but plans to decline future invites. \n\nI need to consider social norms. Charging for food at a dinner party isn't common unless prior arrangements were made. The host usually covers meal costs as part of the hospitality. The friend's approach might have been inconsiderate or not clear beforehand. \n\nThe author's reaction seems reasonable. They didn't argue but felt justified in feeling upset. Declining future invites is a personal choice and a way to avoid discomfort. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? No, because the friend's action was unusual. The answer should be B.\n"
