It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that a friend charged them for the ingredients used to make pasta during a dinner invitation. The author paid without a fight but feels weird about it and considers not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs for shared meals. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's expected that they cover the cost themselves, unless there's an agreement to split expenses. The friend here listed the cost of ingredients, which might not be something people usually expect to split unless it's a shared activity like cooking together. \n\nThe author might be overreacting if the friend clearly communicated the cost beforehand. However, in most social settings, unless specified, guests don't pay for the ingredients. The amount seems reasonable, but the act of charging for it could be seen as transactional, which might affect the friendship's dynamics. \n\nAlso, the author paid to avoid confrontation, but their discomfort is valid if the friend didn't clarify expectations. The friend's approach might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author's feelings are justified, making them not in the wrong. So, the answer would be B.\n"
