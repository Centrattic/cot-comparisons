It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it was weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author paid without a fight but feels it was a lot and might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you to dinner, they cover the costs, and it's not expected to split the bill unless it's a shared expense. Charging for ingredients might not be common, especially in a casual friend setting. The friend might have had a different expectation, thinking it's fair to split costs if they split the meal, but the author didn't expect that.\n\nThe friend listed out specific amounts for Ubers and ingredients. The Uber part is understandable if they shared rides and split the cost, but the ingredients are tricky. If the author didn't help with shopping or cooking, charging for ingredients might come off as unexpected. The total being higher than expected could be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the author paid without objection to avoid conflict, which is mature, but their feelings of being overcharged are valid. The friend might not realize the social norm here. The key points are expectations and communication. The author didn't agree beforehand to split the meal costs, so the friend should have asked or considered it a gift. The author isn't wrong in feeling the charge was unwarranted. So, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
