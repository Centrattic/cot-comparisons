It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong when their friend charged them for food. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and the evening was nice. Then later, when they met up, the friend asked for 25 dollars, including 13 dollars for the pasta ingredients. The author expected around 10, but was confused. They paid without objections but are now considering not accepting future dinner invites.\n\nThe main issues here are whether it's reasonable to charge for shared meals and the amount charged. Let's consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you for dinner, especially as a friend, it's an act of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected and could make the guest feel like they're paying for something that was supposed to be a friendly gesture. \n\nThe amount for ingredients is 13 dollars. How much does pasta really cost? Maybe a couple of dollars for noodles, some sauce, maybe some cheese. 13 seems high unless they used expensive ingredients. The author might feel it's excessive, especially since the main purpose of the dinner was social, not a business transaction.\n\nAlso, the author paid without objections because they didn't want to be petty. But their feelings are valid because they expected a different amount. Declining future invites is a reaction to feeling uncomfortable about being charged for a meal they were invited to. \n\nAnother angle: splitting costs for shared Ubers is common, but splitting food costs when you're a guest is less so. Friends might split costs for shared expenses, but when one is hosting a meal, it's considered a favor. Charging for ingredients might be seen as transactional, which could strain the friendship. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend was just being honest and wanted to split all shared expenses equally. If both agreed beforehand to split all costs, that's different. But since the author didn't expect being charged for the meal, maybe the friend didn't communicate clearly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend might not be in the wrong if they wanted to be strict about splitting all shared expenses. But the author's feeling that it's weird is also valid. It's a bit of a grey area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is not in the wrong because expecting a friend to pay for a hosted meal is part of social norms, and the friend overstepped by charging for ingredients. So the author's reaction is justified.\n"
