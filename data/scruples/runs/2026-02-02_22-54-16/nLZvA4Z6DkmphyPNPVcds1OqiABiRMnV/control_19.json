It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author felt it was weird because they expected to pay for shared Uber rides but not for the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs when someone invites you over. Typically, when someone invites you for dinner, it's considered a favor, and the guest isn't expected to pay for the meal unless it's part of a specific agreement. However, the friend here broke down the costs into Uber rides and ingredients. \n\nThe Uber rides part makes sense because those are shared expenses. But charging for the ingredients used in making the pasta is where it gets tricky. In many social contexts, when someone prepares a meal for you at their home, it's understood that the host covers the cost of the meal as part of hospitality. Expecting the guest to pay for the ingredients might be seen as unusual because the host is providing the meal as a gesture of friendship, not a service where costs are passed along.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on this understanding. They didn't object out of politeness but felt it was strange. The next step is to determine if the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. Since the norm is that the host covers the meal unless it's a specific arrangement (like potluck where everyone brings something), the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the friend explained beforehand that they would split the costs, maybe it would be different. But in this case, the friend added it later without prior discussion, which could be seen as taking advantage of the guest's good faith.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether expecting to be charged for the meal is reasonable. Since it's not customary to split food costs in such a scenario unless agreed upon beforehand, the author's discomfort is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
