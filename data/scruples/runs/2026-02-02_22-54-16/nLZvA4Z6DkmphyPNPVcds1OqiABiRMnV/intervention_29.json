It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objection but now feels conflicted and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you for dinner, it's typically understood that the host is covering the costs as a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients isn't a common practice. The friend here itemized the costs, which might indicate they expected reimbursement for all expenses, including the meal. That could come off as a business transaction rather than a friendly gesture.\n\nThe author's reaction seems reasonable. They paid up to avoid conflict, but their discomfort is valid. The key points are: the dinner was an invitation, the charge for ingredients was unexpected, and the total was higher than anticipated. The friend's approach might not be malicious, but it's unusual and could strain the friendship. The author isn't obligated to pay for the meal unless it was a prior agreement. Declining future invites if the friend continues this practice is a logical step to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
