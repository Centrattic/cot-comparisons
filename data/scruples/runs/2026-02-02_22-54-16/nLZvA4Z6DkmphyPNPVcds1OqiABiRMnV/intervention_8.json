It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses. The author mentions that after a dinner where they were invited, their friend later asked for $25, which included Uber rides and the ingredients for the pasta. They felt confused because they expected around $10, but ended up paying without objections. Now they're wondering if they were right to feel that way and if they should decline future dinner invites.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social norms here. When someone invites a friend over for dinner, is it expected that the guest pays for the ingredients? Typically, when you host a dinner at your home, the host covers the costs of the meal, right? So the Uber rides might be a separate matter if they were shared, but charging for the ingredients seems odd. The author didn't help prepare the meal, didn't mention contributing, so the host covering the meal is normal, but itemizing and charging the guest for the ingredients might be seen as keeping track of expenses too closely, which could make the guest uncomfortable.\n\nThe friend listed all the expenses, which includes the Uber rides and the ingredients. The author might feel that the dinner was a favor or a social event where the host's cost is their own, not something to be reimbursed. Charging for the pasta ingredients might be crossing a line because the host usually absorbs the cost when hosting. The amount seems a bit high for just the ingredients, maybe more than what's typical for a meal. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points are: the host charged for ingredients, the author was confused, paid without complaint, but feels justified in declining future invites. The question is about whether the host's action was wrong or if the author overreacted.\n\nIn many social situations, hosting a meal is a gesture of friendship, and the host doesn't expect reimbursement unless it's a specific agreement. The Uber rides could be split if they were shared and both used them equally, but the pasta ingredients are part of the meal the host is providing. The author not being in the wrong would depend on the context. If there was no prior agreement about splitting costs, then the host's approach might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the friend felt it was necessary to track all shared expenses, maybe the issue is more about the approach than the act itself.\n\nThe friend itemizing the charges could come off as transactional rather than friendly. The author might feel that the dinner was meant to be a social, not a business, interaction. So the friend's action of charging for ingredients could be the issue here, not the author. The author's reaction is understandable; they don't want to be seen as a burden and are choosing to avoid future awkwardness by declining. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's feelings are justified. The friend's approach was probably inconsiderate, making the author feel like they were being charged for a meal they were invited to. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
