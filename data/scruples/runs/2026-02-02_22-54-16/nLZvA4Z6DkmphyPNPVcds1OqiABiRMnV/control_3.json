It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food and other expenses. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend invited them over for dinner, which included a pasta meal. Later, when they met up again, the friend asked for $25 to cover Uber rides and the ingredients for the pasta. The author expected around $10, so they were surprised by the higher amount. They paid without complaint but feel uncomfortable and might decline future invitations.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's understood that they're covering the meal unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs, but it's unusual. Similarly, Uber rides are a bit different because those are shared expenses, but splitting the exact cost is common. However, adding the cost of ingredients for the meal could be seen as expecting reimbursement, which isn't typical.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on the idea that the friend charged a lot, especially for the ingredients. They paid without arguing but feel justified in their feelings. The key points here are expectations. The author might not have expected to be charged for the meal's ingredients, which is a gray area. \n\nIn many social situations, friends don't charge each other for meals unless it's a specific arrangement. So, if the friend expected reimbursement for ingredients, maybe they should have mentioned it beforehand. The author didn't do anything wrong by not paying upfront, especially since it was a social gathering. \n\nThe friend's approach of itemizing the expenses might come off as expecting payment for the meal, which isn't standard. The author's discomfort is valid because it's unusual and could make them feel like they're being charged for a favor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions might be questionable for charging for ingredients without prior notice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
