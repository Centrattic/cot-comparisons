It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a friend charged them for ingredients used to make pasta during a dinner. The author felt it was weird and expensive, so they're considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually expected that the host is covering the costs as part of the hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting hairs or being too transactional. The friend listed specific amounts for Ubers and the pasta ingredients, which adds up to more than the author expected. \n\nThe author didn't object and paid, but still feels it's too much. The key points here are the expectation of the guest when being invited and whether it's reasonable to charge for the dinner itself. In many cultures, if you invite someone over for a meal, it's customary to provide the food without expecting them to pay, unless there's a prior agreement. The Uber part is a shared expense, which makes sense, but the ingredients part is the issue. \n\nThe author is feeling justified in their reaction but also wondering if they're overreacting. The friend's action of charging for ingredients might create a sense of discomfort, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand. The author's decision to decline future invites is a response to feeling taken advantage of or uncomfortable with the transactional aspect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend didn't mention charging for ingredients upfront, the author could argue that it was unexpected. However, the author might be in the wrong if they agreed to split costs or if the friend has a habit of expecting reimbursement. But the story doesn't indicate prior agreement, so the author's reaction is probably valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
