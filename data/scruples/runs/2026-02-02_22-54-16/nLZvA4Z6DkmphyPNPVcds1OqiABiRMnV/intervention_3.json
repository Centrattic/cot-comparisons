It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author feels this is weird and over the top, leading them to consider not attending future dinners. They want to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend charged for Uber rides and ingredients. The author expected around $10 but was asked for $25, with the breakdown including $13 for pasta ingredients. The author paid but feels uncomfortable and plans to decline future invites.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. When someone invites another for dinner, especially as a friend, it's usually considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as turning a social visit into a transactional one. People typically don't expect to be reimbursed for the cost of cooking unless it's agreed beforehand. The Uber charges are for shared rides, which makes more sense to split, but the ingredients might be different. \n\nIs there an expectation here? If the friend mentioned beforehand that they'd want reimbursement for ingredients, maybe. But since it was after the fact, the author feels it's unexpected. The amount for the ingredients is also high\u2014$13 for pasta? That seems like a lot for a single meal, but maybe depending on where they are. However, the main issue is the principle: is it reasonable to charge a friend for food made during a social visit?\n\nAlso, the author's reaction is to decline future invites. That's a personal choice based on their discomfort. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nFrom a social perspective, the friend might have been trying to be fair with shared expenses, but including the cost of the meal could be seen as crossing a line. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about it. They handled it by paying without objection, which is polite, but their feelings are valid. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's action of charging for ingredients was unexpected and possibly inconsiderate, and the author's reaction is justified.\n"
