It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. The friend made pasta and then later charged them $13 for ingredients, plus Uber rides. The author paid but is now considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the social norms here. When someone invites you over for dinner, especially a homemade meal, is it expected to split the cost? Some people might split the cost of shared expenses, but others might see it as a gesture of hospitality. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author didn't expect to be charged for the ingredients. If the friend didn't mention splitting costs beforehand, then the author's reaction is understandable. Charging for ingredients could be seen as splitting costs, but if it's a regular thing, maybe that's part of the social arrangement. However, $13 for pasta ingredients seems a bit high. How much does pasta and sauce really cost? Maybe it's expensive, but if the friend didn't specify splitting the cost beforehand, that's a problem.\n\nThe Uber rides being split is more straightforward because it's a shared expense. But the ingredients part is tricky. If the friend had said, \"Hey, we can split the cost of dinner if you're okay with it,\" then the author would have known. But since it came up later without prior communication, the author's confusion is valid. The author didn't object because they didn't want to be petty, but their feeling that it's weird is justified.\n\nThe author plans to decline future invites, but maybe they could have discussed it before. However, since the friend didn't set expectations, the author isn't at fault for feeling that way. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
