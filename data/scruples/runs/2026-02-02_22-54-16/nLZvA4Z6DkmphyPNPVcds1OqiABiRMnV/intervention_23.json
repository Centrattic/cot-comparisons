It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for being upset that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them $13 for the ingredients. The person feels it's weird and expensive, so they're considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually their way of showing hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected. The friend itemized the charges, including Uber and groceries. The person didn't object but feels it's too much.\n\nIn many cultures, when you host a dinner, the host covers the costs as a gesture of friendship. Asking for reimbursement for ingredients could be seen as making a financial transaction out of a social event. The amount feels high for a casual gathering. The person didn't argue because they didn't want to be petty, but their feelings are valid. Deciding to decline future invites is a reaction to feeling uncomfortable with the financial expectation.\n\nThe friend's approach might have been to split costs equally, but the way it's presented (listing every expense) could come off as keeping track strictly, which might not align with the usual social expectation of the host covering the meal. The person's reaction is about feeling that the friend is monetizing a social activity, which isn't typical. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer should be B.\n"
