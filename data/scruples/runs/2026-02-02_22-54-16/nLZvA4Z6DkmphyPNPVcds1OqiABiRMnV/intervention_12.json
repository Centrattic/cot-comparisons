It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for ingredients used in a dinner. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the author over for pasta dinner. The author enjoyed it. Later, when settling shared expenses, the friend included the cost of the pasta ingredients. The author thought it was weird to be charged for that and now might avoid future invites.\n\nHmm, charging for ingredients... That's a bit unusual. Usually, when someone hosts a dinner, they cover the costs themselves as a gesture of hospitality. Splitting shared expenses like Ubers is common, but expecting guests to pay for food might not be standard. The friend itemized everything, which makes the author feel like they're being charged for something that was supposed to be a friendly gesture.\n\nThe author didn't object at the time but is now considering not going again. Is the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend didn't mention the cost beforehand, it's a surprise. The author probably expected the dinner to be a gift, not a billable expense. The friend's approach might come off as transactional, which could hurt the friendship. The author's feelings are valid because they might feel it's inconsiderate to charge for hospitality.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend felt it was fair to split all shared costs, including ingredients. But usually, when you host someone, you don't expect reimbursement unless it's a potluck or a specific agreement. The amount charged here is significant\u2014$13 for ingredients. That's a big chunk, so the author's reaction makes sense.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to feel upset about being charged for a dinner that was meant to be a friendly social event. The answer should be B.\n"
