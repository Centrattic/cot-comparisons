It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them $13 for pasta ingredients. The writer feels it's weird and might decline future dinner invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the expectations here. When a friend invites you over for dinner, is it customary to split the cost of ingredients? Sometimes people do, sometimes they don't. It depends on the context and prior agreements. The friend here listed the expenses, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The writer was expecting around $10 but was asked for $25, which included $13 for ingredients. \n\nThe main points are: The friend charged for ingredients, and the writer thinks it's a lot. The writer paid without a fight but is considering not attending next time. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nLooking at the possible answers, A says yes (author is wrong), B says no. I need to determine which. \n\nIn many social situations, when you're invited over for a meal, the host typically covers the cost unless it's a prearranged potluck or splitting expenses. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected. However, the friend also had Uber rides to split, which are more commonly shared. The $13 for ingredients could be seen as the main issue here. If the meal was a regular occurrence or if they had a habit of splitting costs, maybe it's reasonable. But if it's an occasional dinner, expecting reimbursement for ingredients might be considered odd by some. \n\nThe writer's reaction is to feel it's weird and maybe decline in the future. That's a personal choice based on their discomfort. The friend might have thought it's fair to split all shared costs, but the writer finds it unnecessary. Since the writer didn't argue but just paid, there's no direct conflict. The question is about the writer's feelings and actions. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the writer's discomfort is valid, especially if there was no prior agreement. Charging for ingredients isn't a standard practice in most social gatherings, so the writer's reaction makes sense. They handled it politely by paying but choosing not to attend next time, which is their right.\n"
