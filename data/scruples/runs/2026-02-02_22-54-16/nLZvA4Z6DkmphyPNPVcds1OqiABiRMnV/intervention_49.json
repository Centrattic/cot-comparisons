It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was invited for dinner, enjoyed it, and later when paying back shared expenses, the friend added the cost of the pasta ingredients. The author expected around $10 but got a $25 total with a breakdown including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. They paid without objection but feel it's a bit much and plan to decline future invites if this continues.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about splitting costs and expectations. When someone invites you for dinner, it's common for them to prepare the meal as a gesture of hospitality. Charging the guest for the ingredients might not be standard unless there was an agreement beforehand. Shared expenses like Uber rides are more straightforward because they are out-of-pocket costs. However, charging for the food itself could be seen as splitting costs 50-50, which might not be expected unless both agreed to contribute. The author didn't object, which might indicate they're agreeable, but their feelings of being uncomfortable are valid if they weren't aware of the expectation to split food costs. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing the pasta cost, making it feel like a business transaction rather than a friendly gesture. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They have the right to set boundaries if they feel the charges are unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
