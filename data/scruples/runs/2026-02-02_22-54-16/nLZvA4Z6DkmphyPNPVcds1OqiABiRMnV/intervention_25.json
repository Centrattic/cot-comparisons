It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who charged them for ingredients used in a pasta dinner. The author paid without objection but feels uncomfortable and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered their hospitality. Charging for the cost of ingredients might not be the norm unless there's prior agreement. The friend listed out the costs, including the Uber rides, which the author was already paying back. The main issue is the 13 dollars for ingredients. \n\nThe author didn't object but feels it's a lot. So, is the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, it's common to expect that when you're invited to dinner, you're not supposed to pay for the food unless it's a paid event or agreed beforehand. The friend might have expected splitting costs, but the author wasn't aware. \n\nThe author's reaction is to decline future invites, which is their right. They didn't argue, just paid. So, their feelings are valid. The friend's action might be seen as overcharging or not considering social etiquette. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't at fault for feeling the charge was too much. The friend might have misinterpreted the arrangement. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
