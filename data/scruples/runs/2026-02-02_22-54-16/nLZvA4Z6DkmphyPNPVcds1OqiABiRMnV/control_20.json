It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without objection but feels weird about it and might not accept future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually a gesture of friendship, not an expectation to split costs unless agreed beforehand. The friend charged for the ingredients, which isn't typical. People often cook for friends without expecting payment for ingredients. So maybe the friend overstepped.\n\nThe author paid because they didn't want to be petty, but they're now feeling resentful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend didn't clarify before the dinner that they would charge for ingredients, so the author had no chance to agree or disagree. Charging for basic ingredients might be seen as unexpected and possibly inconsiderate, especially if the meal was meant to be a friendly gesture.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend had expenses and thought it fair to split them. But usually, in such cases, friends might split the cost of the meal if they're sharing, but ingredients are part of the host's responsibility unless specified. The friend listed the costs after the fact, which could be the issue. The author didn't agree to this beforehand, so the friend might have been unreasonable in expecting payment for ingredients.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their feelings are justified because the friend charged for something that wasn't discussed beforehand. Declining future invites is a valid reaction if they feel uncomfortable with that arrangement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
