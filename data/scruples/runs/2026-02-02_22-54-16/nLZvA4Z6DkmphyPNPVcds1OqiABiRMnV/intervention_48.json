It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients and shared Uber rides.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The friend invited the person over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. Also, there were Uber rides shared. The friend calculated the owed amount as $25, including $13 for the pasta ingredients. The person feels it's a lot and plans to decline future invitations.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was it appropriate to charge for the dinner ingredients? How about splitting Uber rides? And is the person overreacting?\n\nIn many cultures, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally understood that they're covering the costs as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the ingredients might come off as unexpected or impolite. However, if the friends had an agreement beforehand where they split all expenses, maybe it's different. But in this case, it seems like the dinner was a social event, so expecting reimbursement for ingredients isn't typical. \n\nRegarding the Uber rides, splitting costs for shared expenses is reasonable. If they used each other's company and shared rides, splitting the Uber fees makes sense. The issue is more about the dinner ingredients. The person might feel it's unfair because it's part of the hospitality. \n\nThe person didn't object and paid, but feels justified in declining future invitations. They might be upset because the friend didn't mention the charges beforehand, leading to a surprise bill. The friend's expectation of being reimbursed for the pasta ingredients isn't in line with standard social norms in many cases. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They felt the charges were excessive and unexpected. The friend's approach might have been inappropriate. The author isn't at fault for feeling that way. Declining future invites isn't a bad response if they feel comfortable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
