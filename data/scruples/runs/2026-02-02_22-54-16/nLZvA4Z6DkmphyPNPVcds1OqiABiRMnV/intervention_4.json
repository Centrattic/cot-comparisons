It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author feels this is odd and decides to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected. The friend listed expenses, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author thinks the total is too high (25 instead of expected 10) and feels charged for the meal.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Typically, when someone hosts a dinner, they don't expect reimbursement unless it's a potluck or a specific arrangement. Charging for ingredients might be seen as turning a social event into a financial transaction. The author didn't object at the time but feels justified in being upset. They plan to decline future invites, which is their right.\n\nThe key points are: the unexpected charge for the meal, the amount being higher than expected, and the author's reaction. The question is if the author is in the wrong. The friend might argue that they're covering costs, but the author sees it as a social gesture. Since there's no prior agreement about splitting costs, the friend's action could be seen as inappropriate. The author isn't wrong for feeling that way. So the answer is B.\n"
