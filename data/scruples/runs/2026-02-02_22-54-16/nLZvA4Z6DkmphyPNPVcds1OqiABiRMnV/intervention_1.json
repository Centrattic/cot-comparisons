It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner and made pasta. Later, when they met up, the friend asked the author to pay back $25 for shared Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author thought it was around $10, but the friend added up the rides and the ingredients, totaling $25. The author paid without objections but feels weird about being charged for the dinner. Now they're considering not going to future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally considered a favor, not a service to be billed. So charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected. However, if the Uber rides were shared, splitting those costs makes sense. The confusion comes from the ingredients part.\n\nThe author didn't object because they didn't want to be petty, which is understandable. But their discomfort is valid. Charging for groceries used in a friendly meal is not typical. The amount charged for ingredients ($13) might be a bit high if it's just pasta, which could be a simple meal. Maybe the friend was trying to split costs evenly, but the approach felt off.\n\nThe author's reaction of declining future invitations if asked again is a bit harsh? Maybe, but it's their way of setting a boundary. They might feel that the friend didn't consider their feelings in charging for the meal. Friends usually don't charge each other for such things unless it's a specific agreement beforehand. The friend might not have realized how the request could be perceived.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend could have just asked if the author wanted to contribute for the ingredients, rather than itemizing it like a bill. The way it was presented might have made it feel transactional instead of a friendly gesture. The author isn't wrong to feel that. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The friend's approach was the issue, not the author's reaction.\n"
