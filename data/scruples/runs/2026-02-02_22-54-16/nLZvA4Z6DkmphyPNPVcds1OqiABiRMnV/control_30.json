It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for food. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The writer is confused because they expected a small amount for Uber rides, but the friend added 13 dollars for the pasta ingredients. They paid without objection but are considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the friend's actions were wrong or if the writer is overreacting. Charging for ingredients when hosting a meal can be a point of contention. Some people see it as fair to split costs if they're sharing expenses, while others consider it a gesture of friendship and not something to be paid back. The key here is whether splitting the cost of ingredients is a common practice between the two friends. \n\nIn many social contexts, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's customary not to charge the guest for the food, unless there's a prior agreement or it's part of a shared expense setup. The friend might have expected a split of costs, but 13 dollars for ingredients might seem steep if the meal was a simple pasta dish. The writer might feel it's unreasonable because the meal was a friendly gesture, not a business transaction. \n\nAlso, the writer's reaction\u2014paying without objection but planning to decline future invites\u2014shows they didn't want conflict. Their hesitation is about feeling it's too much, which is a valid personal boundary. The friend's approach could have been more considerate by not itemizing the charges so precisely, which might come off as keeping strict account. \n\nSo, considering the social norms and the context, the friend's action of charging for ingredients, especially in a detailed manner, might be seen as inappropriate. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
