It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients plus Uber rides. The author paid without objections but is now considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you for dinner, it's generally expected that they cover the cost unless there's an agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless they had a prior discussion about splitting expenses. The Uber part is a bit clearer if they had shared rides, but even then, splitting the cost is common. However, adding the food cost could be seen as unexpected. \n\nThe author didn't object immediately, which might suggest they felt awkward or didn't want to argue. But their feelings of being upset are valid because there was no prior agreement. Friends are supposed to socialize without expecting payment for meals. The friend's action might be seen as treating it like a business transaction rather than a friendly gesture. \n\nHowever, the author could have brought up the issue at the time. By not doing so, maybe they contributed to the situation. But the main point is the friend's action, not the author's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling it was wrong. They are justified in their feelings, especially if there was no prior agreement. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
