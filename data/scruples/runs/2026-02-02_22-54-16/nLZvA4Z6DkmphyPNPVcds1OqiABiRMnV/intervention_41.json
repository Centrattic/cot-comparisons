It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without argument but is considering not accepting future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When a friend invites you over, it's usually expected that the host covers the meal as a courtesy. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs in a literal way, but it could come off as inconsiderate. The friend listed out the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients, totaling $25. The author expected around $10, so the discrepancy is part of the issue.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Charging for a hosted meal, 2) The amount being higher than expected, 3) The author's reaction of paying but planning to decline future invites. \n\nIn many cultures, when you host someone, the host typically doesn't expect reimbursement for the meal unless it's a shared expense arrangement beforehand. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing and charging for each part, including the pasta ingredients. The author's discomfort is understandable because it's not customary to charge for a meal unless there's a prior agreement. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. They handled it gracefully by paying without argument but are setting boundaries by declining future invites. The friend's approach might be seen as transactional rather than friendly, which could explain the author's justified feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
