It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for dinner ingredients. The writer is confused because they expected a smaller amount but were charged $13 for the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When someone invites you for dinner, it's common to split the bill or cover your own share. But charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting hairs. The writer didn't mention contributing to the meal, so maybe the friend expected them to cover the cost. However, $13 for ingredients could be a lot depending on what was bought. If it's just pasta and sauce, that's expensive. Maybe the friend overestimated or included unnecessary costs.\n\nThe writer paid without objection but plans to decline future invites. Their feelings are valid if they feel it's unfair. The key points are: 1) Is charging for ingredients typical? 2) Was the amount reasonable? 3) Did the writer have prior agreement?\n\nThere's no mention of prior discussion about splitting costs. Friends sometimes cover their own expenses, but expecting reimbursement for ingredients isn't standard unless agreed beforehand. The writer's reaction\u2014feeling it's odd and deciding to decline next time\u2014is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. They didn't argue or cause conflict, just paid and moved on. \n\nThe friend's approach might be seen as keeping track too meticulously, which can strain friendships. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. So the answer is B.\n"
