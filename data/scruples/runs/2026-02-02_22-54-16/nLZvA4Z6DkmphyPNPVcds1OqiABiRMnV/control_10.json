It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their friend was wrong to charge them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner and later charged them for ingredients, which the author found odd. They paid up but now feel it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites someone over for dinner, it's understood that the host covers the cost unless there's prior agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs when there's a shared expense, but expecting the guest to pay for the meal could be unusual unless they had discussed it beforehand. The author's confusion makes sense because it's not typical unless they were splitting expenses equally.\n\nThe friend listed specific amounts: Uber rides and ingredients. The Uber part is clearer since shared rides are usually split. But the ingredients part is where the tension is. If the pasta was part of the dinner invitation, the host usually pays. The author might feel it's an unnecessary split, especially if the meal was a gesture of friendship rather than a shared expense scenario.\n\nAlso, the amount charged for ingredients ($13) seems high for a casual dinner. Maybe the friend felt they needed to recover costs, but the author wasn't expecting that. The key here is whether there was an understanding beforehand. Since there wasn't, the author's reaction is valid. They didn't object to avoid conflict, but their feelings are justified because the expectation wasn't clear.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The friend might have been unreasonable by not clarifying the cost-sharing upfront. The author's decision to decline future invites if the same happens is a personal choice, not a mistake. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
