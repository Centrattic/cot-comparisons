It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author expected to pay back around $10 for shared Uber rides but ended up paying $25 because the friend added $13 for the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients might not be typical unless both parties agreed beforehand that the guest would contribute. \n\nThe friend listed out the expenses, including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part makes sense if they shared the cost, but the ingredients? That seems odd. Pasta is usually a personal expense of the host. The author felt it was a bit much and decided to pay without argument but plans to decline future invites. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, the friend might have expected a split of all expenses, but the host is usually responsible for their own meal costs. The author didn't agree to splitting food costs beforehand, so being upset about it makes sense. The amount charged for ingredients is high, and the author's reaction is about feeling the charge was unwarranted. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for thinking it's weird. They were polite, paid without argument, but their feelings are valid. The friend might have miscommunicated or had different expectations, but the host should have covered their own meal costs. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
