It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nSo, the friend made pasta and later charged the author $13 for ingredients among other expenses. The author paid without objection but is now considering not attending future dinners. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. If friends split expenses, it's common to cover shared items like Uber rides. But charging for groceries used in a dinner might be seen as unexpected. People usually don't split the cost of ingredients unless it's agreed beforehand. The author might feel it's unfair because there's no prior agreement. \n\nThe friend listed the charges, including the pasta ingredients. The author paid but is now upset. The key points here are whether there was an expectation of splitting grocery costs. If the friendship involves splitting all shared expenses, maybe the friend is within her rights, but if it's a dinner invitation, charging for groceries might be considered unusual. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling it's weird to charge for food, especially without prior discussion. Declining the next invite is a possible response. In most social settings, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's implied they're covering the cost themselves. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if not discussed beforehand. \n\nAlso, the amount seems a bit high for ingredients. Maybe the cost is reasonable, but the principle is the issue. The author isn't at fault for feeling that way. The friend might have overstepped by charging for groceries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend might have handled it differently. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
