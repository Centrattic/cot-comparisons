It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25 back, including $13 for ingredients. The author is conflicted because they think charging for the ingredients is odd, even though they paid up and don't want to be petty. They're considering not accepting future dinner invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the expectations around social gatherings and splitting costs. When friends get together, it's common that if someone hosts, they might cover the food as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unusual because people usually don't expect to pay back for the food when they're invited over. \n\nThe friend listed specific expenses, including the Uber rides and the ingredients. The Uber part is more straightforward because shared rides are often split. But the ingredients? That's where the conflict is. The author might feel it's part of the host's expense, not something they should be responsible for. \n\nThe author didn't argue and paid, but their feeling of being upset is valid. It's about social norms. If the friend had said \"let's split the Uber and maybe I'll get back the cost of ingredients,\" that might be different. But the way it was presented as a total owed, including ingredients, might make the author feel it's unexpected and possibly unfair. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. It's their reaction to a situation where the friend's approach might not align with common social expectations. However, the friend might have a different view, thinking they should recover costs. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their feelings and potential future actions. Since the author didn't act out of anger or rudeness but just paid and might decline future invites, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
