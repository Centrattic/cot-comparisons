It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling that their friend charged them for food during a dinner invitation. The friend itemized costs for Uber rides and ingredients for pasta. The author paid without objections but feels it's a bit much and might not accept future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you for dinner, it's generally expected that the host is covering the costs as part of hospitality. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as unusual unless there was prior agreement. The Uber rides are shared expenses, which can be split, but the ingredients being charged seems out of place here. \n\nThe friend listed the expenses, but maybe didn't consider that the pasta dinner was a social event where the host typically absorbs the cost. The author's reaction is understandable because expecting to be reimbursed for food in such a context isn't standard. The amount charged might also be a factor\u2014$13 for ingredients could be seen as high if the meal wasn't particularly extravagant. \n\nThe author didn't object, which shows they're trying to be polite, but their hesitation to attend future dinners is a natural response. They aren't being petty; they're reacting to an unexpected financial request in a social setting. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was an agreement beforehand to split costs, the friend might have a point. But since the story doesn't mention that, it's likely the friend overstepped. The author's feelings are justified, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
