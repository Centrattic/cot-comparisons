It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner and later charged them for the ingredients used in the pasta. The author ended up paying back $25, which included $13 for the ingredients. They feel it's wrong to charge for dinner and are considering not attending future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if charging for ingredients in a shared dinner is acceptable. Typically, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's understood that they're covering the cost as a gesture of friendship. Charging for the ingredients might make others uncomfortable because it turns a social gesture into a transactional one. However, if the friend had mentioned upfront that they'd split the costs, maybe it's different. But in this case, the author wasn't informed beforehand.\n\nThe author paid without objection to avoid conflict, which is a mature move. But their feelings of being upset are valid because it's unexpected to be charged for a meal. The question is whether that makes the author in the wrong. The friend's action of charging for ingredients seems to be the main issue here. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected or taken advantage of, which isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, looking at the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The author's feelings are justified, so the answer should be B.\n"
