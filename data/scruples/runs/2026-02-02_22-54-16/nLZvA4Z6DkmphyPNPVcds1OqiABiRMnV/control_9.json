It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author was expecting a small amount for Uber rides but was surprised by a higher total that included the cost of the pasta ingredients. The author paid without argument but is now considering not accepting future invitations. \n\nThe key points here are about social expectations and reciprocity. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's generally understood that the host covers the meal costs as a gesture of friendship. Charging a guest for ingredients might be seen as transactional rather than a social gesture. The friend itemized the costs, which could make the situation feel more like a business arrangement than a friendly get-together.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on feeling that the friend shouldn't charge for the meal. The friend might have a different view, considering shared expenses or wanting to split costs, but the act of charging for the meal itself could be off-putting. The author isn't necessarily at fault for feeling this way. They handled it by paying without confrontation, which shows they're not being petty in the moment, but their decision to decline future invites is a personal boundary.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the friend was just covering actual expenses, and splitting costs is fair. The author might have assumed the meal was a gift, but the friend had a different expectation.\n\nHowever, in many social contexts, hosts don't expect guests to pay for the meal unless it's a special arrangement. The author's discomfort is valid if they expected the meal to be free. The amount charged (13$ for ingredients) seems like a significant portion of the total, which adds to the feeling of being charged for social interaction.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction. They have the right to set boundaries based on their expectations of friendship. The friend might be acting unilaterally without considering the social norms the author expects.\n"
