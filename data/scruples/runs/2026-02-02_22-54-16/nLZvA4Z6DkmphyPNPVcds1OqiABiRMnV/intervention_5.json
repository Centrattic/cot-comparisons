It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's common to assume that the host covers the cost of the meal. Charging the guest for ingredients might be unexpected. The friend listed specific amounts for Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The user felt it was a lot and might not attend future dinners.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Usually, when you're a guest, you might offer to help with the bill, but splitting the ingredients cost could be seen as unusual. The friend might have a different perspective, thinking they should share the cost, but the user was confused. The user paid without protest but is now considering not accepting future invites.\n\nThe key points are the expectation of the host covering the meal costs and the amount charged. The user isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being charged for ingredients. They handled it by paying but are setting boundaries now. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
