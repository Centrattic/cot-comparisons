It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The scenario is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients plus other shared expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around splitting costs. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's often seen as a gesture of friendship, not an expense to be split. However, if there were shared rides, maybe splitting those costs is reasonable. But charging for the ingredients might be where the issue lies. \n\nThe author felt it was too much because they expected around $10 but it came to $25. The friend itemized the charges, including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author paid without objection but now feels the friend is unreasonable and might decline future invites.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are: 1) Charging for the meal ingredients, which is not typical in social settings unless agreed beforehand. 2) The amount being higher than expected. \n\nIf the friend didn't mention up front that they would be splitting the cost of the meal, then the author's reaction is understandable. Friends sometimes cover costs for shared experiences, but meals are usually the host's expense unless it's a potluck or everyone contributes. Charging for ingredients might be seen as itemizing a social expense, which can feel transactional and hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if there was prior agreement or if the friend is just calculating their expenses, maybe it's fair. But the way the friend presented it (listing all items including the meal) might have been unexpected for the author. The author's decision to pay but then decide not to attend future dinners is their choice, but the feeling of being wronged isn't necessarily justified if the friend was honest about the charges. However, the friend's approach could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because the friend's action of charging for the meal ingredients is questionable. The author's reaction is a personal choice based on their comfort, and they aren't in the wrong for feeling that way."
