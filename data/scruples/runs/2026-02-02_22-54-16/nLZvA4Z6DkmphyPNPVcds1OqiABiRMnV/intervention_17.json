It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that a friend charged them for dinner. The situation is that the friend invited them over, cooked pasta, and later itemized the cost for ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a gesture of friendship, and you aren't expected to pay unless it's a prior agreement. The friend here didn't mention charging beforehand, which might be the issue. The author felt it was unexpected and possibly excessive, especially since the initial expectation was around $10 but the total was $25, including $13 for ingredients.\n\nThe friend's action of charging for ingredients could be seen as splitting costs equally, but maybe the author expected the dinner to be a free meal with shared rides. The fact that the author didn't object but plans to decline future invites shows they didn't want to cause conflict. \n\nIs the author at fault? Probably not. It's common to expect hospitality without being charged unless agreed upon. The friend might have miscommunicated their intention, leading to the author's discomfort. The key points are the lack of prior agreement and the unexpected charge for ingredients. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
