It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for dinner and other shared expenses.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the person over for dinner, which is typically an informal social gathering. The key issue here is that the friend charged the person for the ingredients used in making the pasta. Normally, when someone invites you for a meal, they do it as a gesture of hospitality, not expecting to be reimbursed for the food. Charging for ingredients might feel unexpected and unwelcome.\n\nThe person felt confused when the total came to $25 instead of the expected $10. They paid without protest to avoid conflict but are now considering not accepting future invitations. The question is whether the friend overstepped by charging for the dinner, and if the person is wrong for feeling upset about it.\n\nIn many social contexts, splitting costs for shared expenses like Ubers is standard. However, charging for a meal that was an invitation is less common. The friend might have meant to split the cost of the rides, but including the pasta ingredients as part of the debt seems like an overreach. The person is justified in feeling that the friend is treating the dinner as a transaction rather than a friendly gesture.\n\nThe person didn't object at the time to avoid being petty, which is considerate, but their hesitation to attend future dinners is a natural response to feeling uncomfortable about being charged for a meal. They're not in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend's approach might be seen as transactional, which isn't what one expects from a social invite. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
