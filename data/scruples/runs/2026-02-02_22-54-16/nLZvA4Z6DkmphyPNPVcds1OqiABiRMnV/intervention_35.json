It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling it's weird that their friend charged them for food and other expenses.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's common to assume that the host is covering the cost as a gesture of hospitality. Charging for ingredients like pasta might come off as unexpected, especially if it's not previously discussed. The friend itemized the costs, including Ubers and ingredients. While splitting shared expenses like Uber rides is reasonable, adding the cost of groceries for the meal might be seen as splitting the hospitality.\n\nThe author paid without objection to avoid conflict, which is mature, but their decision to decline future invites if the same happens is understandable. The key points are: 1) Charging for groceries wasn't expected, 2) The amount was higher than anticipated, and 3) The author's reaction is based on feeling it's not customary to charge for such things.\n\nCultural norms vary, but in many contexts, hosts don't expect guests to pay for food unless it's a shared expense or a specific agreement. The friend might have seen it as splitting costs equally, but the author felt it was unwelcome. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. So the answer is B.\n"
