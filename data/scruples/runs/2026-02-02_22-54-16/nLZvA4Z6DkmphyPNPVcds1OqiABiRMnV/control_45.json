It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food during a dinner invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The friend invited the author for dinner, they had a nice evening. Later, when settling shared expenses, the friend included the cost of the pasta ingredients. The author expected around $10 but got $25, which included two Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author felt charged too much for the dinner and plans to decline future invites.\n\nNow, the key points here. In social settings, when someone invites another for a meal, it's usually understood that the host covers the cost. Unless there's prior agreement otherwise, expecting the guest to pay for the meal might be unusual. The Uber rides are more straightforward; splitting shared expenses is common. But the ingredients for the meal might be different. The host typically covers their own cooking costs, so adding that to the guest's debt isn't standard. \n\nThe author didn't object at the time, out of politeness, but felt justified in their feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. \n\nLooking at social norms, guests aren't usually expected to pay for the meal itself unless they agreed otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be overreaching. The author's reaction could be seen as reasonable because the friend didn't clarify beforehand. Declining future invitations is their choice if they feel uncomfortable with the arrangement.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the friend's action was out of the norm, and the author's feelings are valid.\n"
