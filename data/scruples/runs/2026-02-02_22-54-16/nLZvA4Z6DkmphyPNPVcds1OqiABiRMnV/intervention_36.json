It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nSo the situation is: the author went to their friend's dinner, had pasta, and later when paying back the friend for shared Uber rides, the friend included the cost of ingredients for the pasta as part of what the author owes. The author paid without objections but now feels the friend was wrong to charge them for the dinner, leading to considering not attending future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs between friends. When someone invites you over for dinner, is it customary to split the cost? Some people might think it's okay to split expenses, especially if it's a shared activity. Others might consider the host providing the meal as part of the hospitality, and not expecting the guest to pay unless agreed beforehand.\n\nThe friend charged the author for the ingredients. The author didn't expect this and felt it was excessive. Now, the question is whether the friend was wrong in doing so. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong\" in the situation.\n\nIf the friend didn't mention up front that they would charge for the ingredients, that could be an issue. The author might feel it's unfair to be charged for something that wasn't discussed. Also, the amount charged seems high (13$ for ingredients for a pasta meal?), which might be another point of contention.\n\nBut in some cultures or friendships, splitting costs is standard. If the friend usually splits expenses and the author was aware, maybe it's expected. However, since the author didn't expect it and felt it was unreasonable, the friend might not have communicated clearly.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Was there prior agreement? 2) Is charging for ingredients after the fact standard in their friendship? 3) Is the amount reasonable? 4) Did the friend cross a social boundary by charging for hospitality?\n\nIf there was no prior agreement, the friend might have overstepped. The act of charging for food prepared for a guest could be seen as impolite in some contexts, as hospitality often involves covering the cost as a gesture of friendship. However, if both friends are in a habit of splitting all shared expenses (like Uber and meals), it might be different.\n\nThe author's reaction is to feel weird and decline future invites. That's a reasonable response if they feel the friend is treating them as a business partner rather than a friend. So, in this case, the friend might be in the wrong for not setting expectations and charging for food without prior discussion, making the author not at fault.\n"
