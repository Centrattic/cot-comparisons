It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's usually considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unexpected, especially since the main purpose of the dinner was to socialize, not to have a shared meal where costs are split. \n\nThe friend listed out specific amounts for Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber charges might be more understandable if they were shared, but the pasta ingredients seem like a personal expense. It's common to share costs for shared rides, but buying groceries for a dinner at someone's home is typically their own expense. \n\nThe author felt it was a lot and decided to pay without objection but plans to decline future invites. Their feelings are valid because the expectation when invited over is usually that the host covers their own costs. Charging the guest for ingredients could be seen as unfair, especially if the guest didn't agree to split the cost beforehand.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have been too direct about charging for personal expenses, which could be why the author is hesitant to accept future invites. The answer should be B.\n"
