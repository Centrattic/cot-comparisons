It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong for being upset that a friend charged them for dinner. The situation is that the friend made pasta and later asked for $13 for the ingredients, which the user found surprising because they expected only around $10 for Ubers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites someone over for a meal, it's usually not expected to charge for the food unless it's a business arrangement or a specific agreement beforehand. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting hairs, especially if the meal is a friendly gesture, not a service. The user might feel that the friend overcharged, especially since $13 for ingredients could be more than necessary. But maybe the friend actually spent that amount and just wants to be reimbursed.\n\nThen there's the user's reaction. They paid without objections but plan to decline future invites. That shows they're not trying to avoid paying but are upset about being charged for something they didn't expect. The user could be overreacting if the friend was clear about splitting costs, but if it wasn't discussed beforehand, the user's feelings are valid.\n\nAlso, the friend might have a different perspective, thinking that sharing expenses is fair, especially if they contribute more to the shared costs. However, including food in a casual dinner might not be standard. The key here is whether there was prior agreement. Since there wasn't, the user's discomfort is understandable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in feeling that charging for dinner wasn't expected in a casual friend setting. The answer is B.\n"
