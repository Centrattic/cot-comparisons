It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went to a friend's dinner where pasta was made. The friend later asked for $25, which included Uber rides and ingredients. The author expected around $10 for the Ubers but was charged an extra $13 for the pasta ingredients. They paid without complaint but feel uncomfortable and plan to decline future invites.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). My initial thought is B, but let me think through the nuances.\n\nWhen someone invites you to dinner, it's customary in many cultures that the host covers the cost. Charging a guest for ingredients might be seen as unusual unless it's a business setting or a specific agreement. The author's confusion is valid here. The friend itemized the charges, which the author found odd, especially the $13 for ingredients. \n\nHowever, the friend might have considered splitting costs for shared expenses, like Ubers. But charging for ingredients used in a casual dinner isn't standard. The author's discomfort isn't petty; they're reacting to an unexpected and perhaps unreasonable charge. Declining future invites is a reasonable response if they feel their friend is keeping track of expenses in a way that's uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points are the cultural norm of hosts covering their own meal costs, the unexpected itemization of ingredients, and the friend's approach to splitting shared costs. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way. Their reaction is about personal boundaries and expectations in friendships. So, the answer is B.\n"
