It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for $25, including $13 for ingredients. The person paid without objections but is now considering not accepting future invites because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. When you're invited for dinner at someone's home, especially a friend, it's usually expected that the host covers the cost as part of hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The friend listed out specific expenses, which adds to the confusion. The person might feel it's excessive because it's not common to split ingredient costs unless it's a shared responsibility or a business arrangement. \n\nThe key points here are social norms. In many cultures, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's a gesture of friendship, not a transactional exchange. Charging for ingredients could be seen as making the guest pay for the meal, which might feel odd. However, if the cost was for specific, shared expenses like Uber rides, splitting those is more common. The $13 for ingredients is the main point of contention here.\n\nThe person didn't object at the time, which might suggest they felt it was better to just pay rather than argue, but their feelings of being upset and planning to decline future invites indicate they felt wronged. The question is whether the friend was wrong to charge for the ingredients or if the person is overreacting.\n\nI need to consider if there's a standard practice here. If the friend made the pasta specifically for them and included the cost of ingredients, that's different from a shared meal where everyone contributes. Since it was a dinner invitation, the host typically covers the cost. Charging the guest could be seen as expecting reimbursement, which might not be customary unless it's a business context or there's an agreement beforehand.\n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
