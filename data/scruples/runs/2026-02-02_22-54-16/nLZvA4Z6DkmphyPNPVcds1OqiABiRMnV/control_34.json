It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later asked for money back for the ingredients, Ubers, etc. The writer expected around $10 but was asked $25. They paid without objection but are now considering not attending future dinners.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's typically considered a social gesture, not a business transaction. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless there was prior agreement. The writer feels it's wrong because it's unexpected and perhaps excessive. \n\nI should consider cultural factors too. In some cultures, splitting costs is normal, but in others, the host covers expenses as a gesture of hospitality. The friend listing out each expense, including the pasta ingredients, might come off as keeping score, which can strain friendships. \n\nThe writer didn't object when paying, which shows they might not want conflict, but their hesitation to attend future dinners indicates they feel the situation was unfair. The friend's actions might have crossed a line by itemizing the costs, making it seem transactional rather than a kind gesture.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend's approach was unexpected and could be seen as inappropriate. The author's reaction is a valid response to feeling taken advantage of, even if they paid up. The friend might have overstepped by charging for the meal, which is usually a host's expense unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
