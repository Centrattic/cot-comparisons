It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author feels it's a lot, expected about $10 but was asked for $25, which included Uber rides and the ingredients. They paid without objections but now feel hesitant to accept future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's expected that they're covering the cost as part of the hospitality. Charging the guest for ingredients might be seen as unusual unless there was prior agreement. The Uber part is a bit different because shared expenses are common, but combining it with the meal might be a stretch.\n\nThe author's reaction seems reasonable. They didn't object to pay back the Uber rides, which are shared expenses, but charging for the pasta ingredients feels off. It's about expectations. If the friend had mentioned beforehand that they'd expect reimbursement for ingredients, maybe the author would have understood. But since it was a surprise, the author's discomfort makes sense. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're reacting to an unexpected billing for a social gesture. The friend might have overstepped by expecting payment for the meal, which is typically a kindness. The author's decision to decline future invites is their right, as they feel it's not worth it. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
