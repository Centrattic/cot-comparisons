It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a favor and not an exchange where you have to pay for the ingredients. Charging for the food might come off as transactional, which can feel odd in a friend's dinner. So, the author's discomfort is understandable.\n\nNext, the amount in question is $13 for ingredients. That might not seem like a lot, but if the friend didn't mention it beforehand, that could be a problem. People usually expect to pay for shared expenses like Uber rides, but charging for the cost of making a meal that was meant to be a gesture of friendship is different. \n\nThe author paid without objections to avoid being petty, which shows they don't want conflict. However, their feeling of being charged for a meal that was supposed to be a friendly gesture is valid. Charging for the ingredients might be seen as expecting reimbursement, which isn't typical in such situations. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was fair to split the costs since they shared other expenses too. But the key point is whether the friend communicated this expectation upfront. If they didn't, it's reasonable for the author to feel it's unexpected and maybe even unwelcome.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The friend might have overstepped, especially if there was no prior discussion about splitting the cost of the meal. The author's reaction is justified because it's a social norm to invite friends over without expecting them to pay for the food. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
