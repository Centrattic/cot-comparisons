It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them $13 for the ingredients. The author thought the dinner was nice but felt charged an unexpected amount. They planned to pay back $10 for Uber but ended up paying $25. The friend listed the breakdown, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author now feels conflicted but didn't object and plans to decline future invites.\n\nSo, the main points here are whether it's acceptable to charge a friend for dinner. Let me think about social norms. Typically, when friends invite each other over for meals, it's considered a gesture of hospitality. Charging for the food might be seen as turning a social event into a transactional one. However, if there was prior agreement or if the cost is split, that's different. But in this case, the friend didn't mention splitting costs beforehand. The author was surprised when the friend listed the ingredients cost. \n\nThe amount charged for ingredients might be questionable. If the pasta was made with ingredients the friend already had, charging the full cost might not be fair. Usually, people might split the cost if they're sharing a meal, but expecting someone to pay for all the ingredients could be seen as unreasonable. The author might be right to feel uncomfortable because it's not customary to charge a friend for the full cost of a meal unless it's a business arrangement or a specific agreement.\n\nAlso, the friend's approach of listing the expenses after the fact without prior discussion could have been confusing or off-putting. The author's reaction is understandable because it's a social interaction, not a business transaction. The fact that the author paid but now plans to decline future invites shows they're upset but don't want to be confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend felt they should recover the costs, especially if they had to buy ingredients specifically for the dinner. However, the expectation of splitting costs isn't universal. Some people might split the cost of shared expenses, but the ingredients for a meal are part of the host's usual responsibility when inviting someone over. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's feelings are justified. Charging for the ingredients wasn't the norm in a social setting, and the amount might have been too high. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
