It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for food during a dinner invitation.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, especially a friend, it's generally expected that they're doing it as a gesture of friendship, not as a business transaction. Charging for the ingredients used might be seen as expecting reimbursement for costs, which is not uncommon in some contexts, like splitting shared expenses. However, the main issue here is the dinner itself. If the friend made the pasta specifically for the dinner, it's a personal expense to host a friend. Charging for that could be seen as inappropriate because the dinner was the purpose of the gathering, not a service rendered for payment.\n\nThe user mentioned the friend also added Uber rides, which is reasonable if they split costs. But adding the pasta ingredients seems off. The friend might have considered splitting all shared expenses, but the dinner itself wasn't a shared expense; the friend was hosting. The user felt it was too much because the dinner was part of the invitation, not an extra charge. \n\nAlso, the user gave the money without objection but plans to decline future invitations. This shows they didn't want conflict but still felt the charge was unreasonable. The key points are the expectation when being invited for dinner and whether charging for the host's own meal is acceptable. \n\nIn social contexts, unless it's a potluck or a dinner where everyone contributes, the host usually covers their own costs as part of the hospitality. Charging for the meal might cross a line into expecting payment for the social event, which is where the user feels wronged. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way.\n"
