It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The writer thought it was weird and overpriced but paid up to avoid conflict and now might decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you for dinner, it's usually expected that they cover the costs as part of the hospitality. Charging back for ingredients might be seen as unexpected or awkward. The friend itemized the costs, which might make it feel like a business transaction instead of a friendly gesture.\n\nThe amount mentioned is $13 for ingredients. If the pasta meal cost $13 in ingredients, that's actually a bit high. Let's break it down. A box of pasta is maybe $2, some sauce could be $3-4, vegetables maybe $5, meat maybe a bit more. But maybe they used more expensive ingredients or bought in bulk. However, the total of $25 for shared Ubers and ingredients might seem excessive to the writer, but the Ubers are $12 total. The main issue is the $13 for the ingredients.\n\nThe writer didn't object but felt conflicted. Is it wrong to feel that way? Probably not. Social situations involve expectations, and if the friend had a different expectation than the writer, it's a miscommunication. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They handled it politely by paying, but their hesitation to accept future invites is understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
