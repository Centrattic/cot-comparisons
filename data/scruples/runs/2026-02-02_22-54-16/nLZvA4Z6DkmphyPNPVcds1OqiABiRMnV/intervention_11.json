It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid without argument but is now considering declining future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the social norms here. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a favor, and you don't expect to be charged unless you've agreed beforehand. The friend added the cost of ingredients to the Uber rides, which the author found unexpected. \n\nCharging for food might depend on the relationship and the context. If they're splitting costs for shared expenses like Uber, that's common. But adding the cost of ingredients to that? That seems odd because the dinner was a hospitality gesture, not a business transaction. The author's reaction might be justified because the friend didn't clarify beforehand that they'd be charged for the meal. \n\nAlso, the amount was higher than expected. The friend listed all the expenses, which could make the friend seem like they're keeping strict account. The author might feel that the friend is being too transactional, which could affect their friendship. \n\nThe author didn't object at the time, which shows they're considerate, but their hesitation to attend future dinners is understandable. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid feelings about being charged for a meal they were invited to. The friend might have overstepped by not being clear upfront. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
