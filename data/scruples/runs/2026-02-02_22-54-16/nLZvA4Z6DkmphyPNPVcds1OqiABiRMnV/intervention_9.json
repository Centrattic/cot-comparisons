It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients, along with Uber rides. The person ended up paying back $25, but feels it's weird and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to recall common social norms around splitting costs. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's considered a social gesture, not a transactional one. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected unless it's a shared expense. The Uber rides are more straightforward if they shared rides and agreed to split costs.\n\nThe friend listed out the expenses, which adds up to $25. The person expected around $10, probably just for the Uber. The issue here is the charging for the pasta ingredients. Social norms might suggest that the host covers the cost of the meal unless it's a specific agreement. Charging for ingredients might come off as keeping track of every penny, which can make people uncomfortable.\n\nThe person didn't argue but gave the money, but now feels justified in declining future invites. They're questioning if they're at fault. The key is whether charging for the meal was reasonable. If the friend had mentioned the cost beforehand, maybe it's different, but since it was after the fact, it might be seen as unexpected. \n\nSo, the author's feelings are valid. They felt the friend was being too calculating, which isn't typical in casual friendships. The friend might have overstepped by itemizing every expense, including the meal. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
