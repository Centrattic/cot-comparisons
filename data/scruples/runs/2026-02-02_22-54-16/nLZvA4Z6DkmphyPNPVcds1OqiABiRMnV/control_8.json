It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend charging them for ingredients used in making pasta during a dinner. The author paid but feels it's weird and might decline future invitations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend invited the author over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The total came out to $25, with $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author expected around $10, thinking only of the Uber rides. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's appropriate to charge a friend for the cost of food when hosting a dinner. Let's break it down. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture. Charging for the ingredients could be seen as transactional rather than a friendly gesture. However, if the two friends had a prior agreement or if there's a culture where splitting costs is customary, maybe that's different. \n\nBut in most cases, hosting a meal is a way to show hospitality. Expecting the guest to pay for the ingredients might come off as expecting reimbursement for the cost, which can feel uncomfortable. Especially if there's no prior discussion about splitting expenses. The friend listed the charges, including the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber part is more about shared expenses, which is common, but the ingredients part is the sticking point here.\n\nThe author paid without objection but feels justified in declining future invites. The friend might have thought they were just splitting the Uber costs, but adding the pasta ingredients was unexpected. The question is about whether the author is wrong for feeling that way. \n\nIn terms of social norms, charging a friend for food when you're the host is not typical. It's usually the host's choice to cover the costs as part of being hospitable. If the friend expects the guest to contribute, it's better to discuss that beforehand. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling it's odd because the friend didn't clarify that they wanted payment for the meal. \n\nAlso, the amount seems a bit high. $13 for ingredients for pasta might be a bit much if it's just a casual dinner. Maybe the friend overestimated the cost or included other expenses. The author's hesitation to attend future dinners is a natural reaction if they feel the friend is more focused on splitting costs than enjoying each other's company. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's feelings are valid. They aren't in the wrong. The friend might have been too direct in charging for the ingredients without prior agreement, which made the author uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
