It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for dinner. The situation is that the friend invited them over for pasta and later charged them for ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a favor and part of the hospitality. Charging for the food might be unexpected. However, if there was an agreement beforehand about splitting costs, maybe it's different.\n\nThe friend listed specific costs: Uber rides and ingredients. The author thought the total would be around $10 but it was $25. The issue here is the ingredients. Is it normal to charge someone for the ingredients when you cook for them? Sometimes people might split costs if they're splitting expenses for shared items, but in a dinner scenario, unless it's a group activity where everyone contributes, it might not be standard.\n\nThe author paid without objections to avoid conflict, but the next time they might decline. Their feeling of being justified is part of the question. The key points are whether charging for the pasta ingredients is reasonable and if the amount was excessive. The author might feel it's a personal expense, while the friend saw it as something to be shared.\n\nI think it's more about differing expectations. The author didn't expect to be charged for the meal, so they're not in the wrong. The friend might have thought it's fair to split all shared expenses, but that's a misunderstanding. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
