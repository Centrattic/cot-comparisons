It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food. The friend made pasta and then later charged the author for ingredients. The author paid without objections but is considering declining future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The main issue is whether charging for ingredients is reasonable. When someone invites you for dinner, it's generally expected that they cover the cost themselves unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected, especially if the guest didn't offer to help cover costs beforehand.\n\nThe friend listed specific amounts for Ubers and ingredients. The Uber part is more about splitting shared expenses, which is common. But the ingredients part is where it gets tricky. If the author wasn't asked to contribute or if it wasn't discussed beforehand, the friend charging for that could be seen as unreasonable. The author felt it was a lot, so their reaction is more about feeling charged for something they didn't anticipate being responsible for.\n\nThe author didn't object then but is now questioning their feelings. Declining next time is a possible reaction, which is their right. The question is whether the author is at fault. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and expectations. In many social contexts, the host covers the meal costs. Charging a guest for ingredients without prior discussion might be seen as the friend's mistake, not the author's.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the friend's actions might be at fault for not communicating the expectation of payment beforehand. The author's discomfort is justified.\n"
