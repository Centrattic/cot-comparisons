It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is wrong for thinking it's weird their friend charged them for food.\n\nSo, the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The person expected maybe $10 but got $25, including $13 for ingredients. They paid without a fight but plan to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider norms around splitting costs for shared expenses. Uber rides are usually split if you share, so that part makes sense. But charging for groceries used in a dinner invite is different. Typically, when someone invites you for a meal, they cover the cost as part of the hospitality. Unless there's an agreement beforehand to split costs, charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected.\n\nThe person might feel it's odd because it's not customary to charge a guest for the meal. The friend might have thought they should split all shared expenses, but the guest wasn't expecting that. The person isn't wrong to feel that way. They didn't object because they didn't want to be petty, which is mature. But planning to decline future invites is their right if they feel uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings. They might need to clarify expectations with the friend if they want to continue the friendship, but their reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
