It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they were invited over for dinner, and later charged for the ingredients used to make the pasta, along with other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to recall common social norms about splitting costs. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, they don't expect you to pay for the food unless it's a shared arrangement or agreed upon beforehand. The friend here listed specific amounts for Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The Uber charges might be more acceptable if they were shared and agreed upon, but the ingredients part is questionable.\n\nThe writer felt it was a lot, especially since the original expectation was around $10. Charging for ingredients could be seen as unexpected unless it's a common practice between them. The writer didn't object and paid, but their discomfort is valid. Declining future invitations is a reasonable response if they feel taken advantage of.\n\nI should consider cultural differences too. In some places, splitting costs is normal, but in others, the host covers everything. Since the writer didn't agree to pay for ingredients upfront, the friend might have overstepped. The key points are prior agreement and whether the charges were reasonable. The writer isn't at fault for feeling wronged here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
