It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food. The situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them not just for shared Uber rides but also for the ingredients of the pasta.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting expenses. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's understood that the host covers the cost unless there's an agreement to split. The author felt it was odd to be charged for the ingredients. That's a common viewpoint because people often see hosting as a gesture of friendship, not a transactional exchange. \n\nThe friend listed all the expenses, including the pasta ingredients. Charging for the meal itself might come off as transactional, which could be seen as inappropriate in a friendly setting. The amount was higher than expected, leading to the author's discomfort. \n\nThe author paid without objection to avoid conflict but plans to decline future invites. Their feelings are justified because expecting to be reimbursed for the meal's cost can feel like the friend isn't considering it a kind gesture but a service provided. However, the friend might have had a different perspective, maybe thinking they were splitting all shared expenses fairly. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend's approach might be at fault for making the interaction too transactional. The author's reaction is about feeling that the friend didn't consider the social norm of hosting. So the answer would be B.\n"
