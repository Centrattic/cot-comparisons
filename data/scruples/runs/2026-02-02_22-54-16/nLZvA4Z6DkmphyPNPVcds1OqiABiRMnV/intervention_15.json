It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend charging them for ingredients used in making pasta during a dinner. The friend listed out the costs, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for a meal, it's generally expected that the host covers the costs unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Charging a guest for ingredients might be unusual, as the host typically absorbs the cost. The amount charged here was higher than expected, which added to the confusion.\n\nThe guest didn't object and paid the money but felt it was odd. The question is whether the guest's feelings are justified. The key points are the expectation of the host covering meal costs and the lack of prior communication about splitting expenses. \n\nCharging for ingredients could be seen as splitting costs in a way that's not customary. The friend might have had a different perspective, but the guest's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and deciding to decline future invites\u2014is a personal choice. There's no clear wrongdoing on the guest's part; they simply didn't agree with the cost-sharing method and chose not to confront it directly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the host's approach to charging for ingredients isn't the norm and wasn't discussed beforehand. The answer should be B.\n"
