It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the scenario is that a friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The friend also charged for Uber rides they shared. The total came out to $25, which was higher than expected. The writer paid without objection but feels it's weird and might not accept future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually not expected to charge for the meal unless there's a prior agreement. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting the cost, but the amount here is $13 for ingredients. That seems like a lot for a home-cooked meal. Typically, people might cover expenses if they're splitting costs for shared activities, like splitting an Uber, but charging for the food isn't standard unless discussed beforehand.\n\nThe writer didn't object at the time, which might be because they didn't want to cause tension. However, their feelings are valid. The friend might have overstepped by charging for the meal, especially if it wasn't discussed beforehand. The key issue here is the expectation of hospitality versus splitting costs. Charging for ingredients could be considered if they had agreed to split expenses for events, but it's less common unless the cost is significant or there's a shared activity where splitting costs is customary.\n\nThe user is questioning their own reaction. They feel justified but might think they're overreacting. But based on common social expectations, the friend's action of charging for the pasta ingredients might be the issue. The writer isn't in the wrong for feeling it's odd; they're within their rights to feel that way and decide to decline future invites if they're uncomfortable with being charged for meals.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions might be the point of contention here, not the writer's feelings about it.\n"
