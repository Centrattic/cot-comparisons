It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nSo, the situation is: the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for ingredients. The person thought it was strange because they expected to split costs like Uber rides, but not food. They paid the money but feel it's a bit much and might avoid future dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. When friends get together, sometimes they split expenses if they're doing things like sharing rides or going out. But when someone invites you over for a meal, the host usually covers the cost of the meal as part of the social gesture. Charging for ingredients might come off as transactional instead of a friendly gesture.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The host charged for ingredients, which is unexpected. 2) The amount was higher than expected. 3) The person paid to avoid conflict but feels it's wrong. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling that way? Well, social norms often dictate that when you're invited over for a meal, the host covers the cost. Charging for ingredients could be seen as not considering the dinner as a friendly get-together but more as a business transaction. The author's reaction is reasonable because they felt it was unexpected and possibly too much. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't communicate this beforehand. If they had agreed to split all expenses, then it's fair. But since the author didn't expect it and it wasn't discussed, the friend might have overstepped. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, especially since they paid without a fight but now have reservations about future plans.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate expectation based on social norms and their reaction is justified.\n"
