It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's common to assume that the host is covering the costs as a gesture of friendship. Charging for ingredients might be seen as unexpected, especially if there was no prior agreement. The friend listed the expenses, including Ubers and pasta ingredients. The author felt it was too much, around $13 for ingredients. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and prior expectations. If there was no discussion about splitting costs beforehand, the host might be overstepping by itemizing and charging for everything. Declining the next invite isn't necessarily wrong if they feel uncomfortable, but maybe there's room for communication. However, the act of charging for a shared dinner without prior agreement could be seen as the friend being inconsiderate, not the author. The author's reaction is understandable given the social context. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
