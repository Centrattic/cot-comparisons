It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the friend invited the author over for dinner and made pasta. The author enjoyed the evening. Later, when the friend asked for payment, including $13 for ingredients, the author felt it was excessive and decided to decline future invitations. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nIn social settings, expecting reimbursement for shared expenses can be subjective. Splitting Uber rides is common and straightforward. However, charging for the cost of food and ingredients might be less typical unless it was pre-arranged. If the friend didn't mention charging for groceries beforehand, the author could feel it's unexpected. The amount charged here, $13 for ingredients, might seem high if the meal wasn't particularly expensive or if it wasn't discussed. The author might perceive it as splitting the cost unevenly, especially if they didn't contribute to the cooking or shopping. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel it's fair to split the cost of groceries if they're being shared. However, it's important to consider social norms. Friends often cover meals without splitting costs unless specified. The friend's approach could be seen as micromanaging expenses, which might lead to discomfort. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. They didn't want to cause conflict, so they paid but decided to avoid future invitations. This isn't necessarily wrong; it's about personal boundaries. The key issue here is the lack of prior communication about splitting grocery costs. If the friend had mentioned it beforehand, the author might have been more prepared. Since it wasn't discussed, charging for ingredients could be seen as unexpected, making the author's feelings justified. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem arises from the friend's approach to charging for groceries without prior agreement, not from the author's reaction.\n"
