It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that a friend charged them for food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend invited the author for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for ingredients. The author felt it was a lot more than expected and decided to decline future invites. They're questioning if they're at fault.\n\nSo, charging for ingredients. Normally, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's customary that the host covers the cost unless agreed otherwise. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless it's a business arrangement or there's some prior agreement. The friend listed specific amounts, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author expected around $10 but was charged $25. The friend's reasoning is that they split all expenses incurred during the shared time.\n\nThe author didn't argue but feels it's justified to be upset. The key here is social norms. In most friendships, splitting costs for shared activities like an Uber is common, but charging for the ingredients used to make a meal might not be. It could be seen as unexpected or unwelcome, especially if the meal was part of the social visit. The author's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and planning to decline future invites\u2014is a personal choice, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nThe friend might have a different perspective, thinking they're splitting expenses fairly. However, charging for ingredients used in a meal isn't standard. Unless there was a prior agreement to split all expenses, the author's discomfort is understandable. The problem is that the friend didn't communicate the expectation beforehand, leading to confusion. The author's reaction is about the social expectation vs. the friend's approach. Since the author didn't object and just paid, maybe they felt it was better to avoid conflict. But the underlying feeling is that the friend's action was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend may have been unreasonable in charging for the meal, and the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
