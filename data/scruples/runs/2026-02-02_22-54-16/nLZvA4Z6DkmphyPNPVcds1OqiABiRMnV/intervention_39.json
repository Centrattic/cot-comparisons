It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend charging them for a meal and other expenses. The author feels it's weird and plans to decline future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Usually, when someone invites you over for dinner, they don't expect to be reimbursed unless it's a specific arrangement. Charging for ingredients might be unusual unless there was a prior agreement. The author didn't anticipate being charged for the pasta ingredients, which could be seen as unexpected. \n\nThe amount charged for the ingredients is $13, which seems high for pasta. That part might be questionable. Also, splitting Uber rides is common, but the total ended up being $25, which the author found excessive. The author paid without argument but is now conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are whether there was an agreement beforehand about splitting costs and whether the charges were reasonable. If the friend didn't mention charging for ingredients in advance, that's a problem. The author's reaction is understandable if they felt it was unfair. \n\nHowever, the author didn't object and paid, so maybe they're overthinking it. But the fact that they're considering not attending next time shows they feel wronged. \n\nIn many cases, people don't expect guests to pay for the meal unless it's a potluck or a specific arrangement. Charging for ingredients without prior discussion could be seen as unexpected. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's approach might be the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
