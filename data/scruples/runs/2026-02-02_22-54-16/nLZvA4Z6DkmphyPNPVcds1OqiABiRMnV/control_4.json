It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking it's weird that their friend charged them for food.\n\nSo, the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and later charged them for the ingredients. The author expected to pay back around $10 for Uber rides but ended up paying $25, with $13 for the pasta ingredients. The author feels that charging for the food is odd and might decline future invites. They're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the friend did something wrong by charging for the ingredients. Typically, when someone invites you for dinner, it's usually an offer of hospitality, and expecting the guest to pay for the meal isn't common unless it's a specific arrangement. However, some people might consider splitting costs if there are shared expenses beyond the meal, like Uber rides.\n\nThe friend included the cost of ingredients as part of the amount owed. The question is whether that's acceptable. If the friend had mentioned in advance that they would split the cost of the meal, maybe it would be different. But the author didn't expect it. Charging for the ingredients could be seen as being strict about splitting every expense, which might be perceived as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's reaction is to feel justified in their discomfort and to consider not attending future dinners. The key points here are: the friend didn't specify beforehand that the guest would pay for the meal, the amount for the ingredients seems high (13$ for pasta ingredients?), and the author felt it was unexpected. \n\nIn many social contexts, it's customary for the host to cover the cost of the meal unless there's a prior agreement to split costs. Charging for the ingredients without prior discussion might come off as stingy or not understanding social norms of hospitality. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They didn't do anything wrong by not anticipating the charge. The friend's action might be the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
