It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user asked if the author is in the wrong when they found out their friend charged them for dinner ingredients.\n\nFirst, the friend invited them for dinner, which is typically seen as a social gesture where splitting costs isn't always expected. However, the friend later itemized expenses, including Uber rides and the cost of pasta ingredients. The author felt it was excessive and now might avoid future invites.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider social norms. When someone invites you for a meal, it's common that they cover the cost as part of the hospitality. Charging for ingredients might be seen as splitting costs too literally, especially if the invite was meant to be a friendly gesture. The Uber charges could be split, but the ingredients part might come off as unexpected or overly calculated. The author's reaction is understandable because the dinner was an invitation, not a business transaction. They didn't object at the time, which is polite, but their hesitation to attend again makes sense given the situation. The friend might have set an unclear expectation, but the author isn't in the wrong for feeling it's odd. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
