It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their friend charged them for the ingredients used in a dinner.\n\nFirst, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a social gesture, not an exchange. Charging for ingredients might be seen as expecting repayment, which can feel transactional. That could make the guest uncomfortable, as the author did.\n\nThe friend added up expenses like Uber rides and the cost of pasta ingredients. While splitting shared expenses like Uber makes sense, charging for the food might not be standard. People usually don't charge guests for the cost of the meal when hosting.\n\nThe author didn't object immediately but felt upset afterward. Their reaction is about the principle of being charged for a social event. Deciding to decline future invites is a personal choice to avoid discomfort, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author's feelings are valid. The friend might have overstepped by charging for ingredients. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Answer B (No) makes sense here.\n"
