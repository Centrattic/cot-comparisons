It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author thought it was weird and now is considering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. When someone invites you over for dinner, it's usually considered a kindness, not something to be billed. Charging for ingredients might come off as transactional, which could be unexpected. Friends often cover small expenses together, like splitting an Uber, but charging for the cost of a meal might be seen as not trusting the other person to pay back any debt, or maybe expecting that the meal is a separate thing from any other shared costs.\n\nThe friend listed out the Uber rides and the pasta ingredients. The author was expecting around $10 but was asked for $25. The $13 for ingredients seems high for a pasta dish. Maybe the friend calculated the cost of groceries, but if the pasta was made for a dinner party, the cost should be split between guests. However, if there was only one other person (the author), then charging half might be reasonable. But maybe the friend didn't split it and charged the full amount, which could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the author paid without objections to avoid being petty, but they feel justified in declining future invites. The key here is whether expecting repayment for the meal's ingredients is socially acceptable. Some might say that if you invite someone over, you cover the meal as a courtesy, and any additional expenses should be discussed beforehand. Others might argue that if you're covering shared expenses, it's fair to split the costs, but maybe the meal itself isn't part of that unless agreed upon.\n\nThe author's feelings seem valid. Being asked to pay for the meal after the fact might feel like the friend is treating the friendship in a businesslike way. The fact that the author is questioning if they're overreacting suggests that there's some gray area, but the act of charging for a meal without prior agreement could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions might be inconsiderate, and the author's reaction is reasonable.\n"
