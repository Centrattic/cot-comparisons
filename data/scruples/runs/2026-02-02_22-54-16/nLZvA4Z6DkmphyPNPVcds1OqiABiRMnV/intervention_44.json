It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset that their friend charged them for ingredients used in a pasta dinner. The friend listed out the costs, including Uber rides and the pasta ingredients.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when someone invites you over for dinner, it's understood that the host covers the cost. Charging guests for food can be seen as unusual unless there's a prior agreement. The author expected around $10 but was charged $25, which includes $13 for ingredients. That's a significant jump. \n\nThe friend's approach might be seen as splitting costs too literally. While sharing Uber costs is common, charging for ingredients could be unexpected. The author's reaction\u2014feeling it's weird and planning to decline future invites\u2014is a personal choice but might stem from feeling taken advantage of. \n\nHowever, the author didn't confront the friend, just paid and moved on. That shows maturity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's action is the main issue here, the author isn't at fault for feeling upset. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
