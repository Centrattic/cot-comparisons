It was a nice evening and I enjoyed every second of it. A couple of days later, we met up again. I was owing her money because of some Uber rides we shared etc. and was planning on paying her back that day. When she told me how much I owed her, I was a bit confused. I expected it to be around 10 Dollars. Instead, she said it was 25 Dollars. When I asked why, she listed it up: \"7$ for our Uber ride to x, 5$ for our Uber ride to y and 13$ for the ingredients I used for the pasta.\"\n\nIt's not only the fact that she charged me for dinner, it's also that she charged me a lot for it imo. I gave her the money without any objections because I didn't want to be petty. But honestly, the next time she invites me over for dinner, I'll probably decline.\n\nPart of me thinks that the way I feel is justified but I also might just be overreacting. What do you guys think?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their friend was weird for charging them for food. So the situation is that the friend invited them over for dinner, made pasta, and then later charged them for the ingredients. The author paid up but feels conflicted and is considering avoiding future invites.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out whether the author's feelings are justified. Charging for food at a friend's dinner isn't a common practice. Usually, when someone invites you over for a meal, it's considered a favor or a social gesture, not a business transaction. So the friend charging for ingredients might be seen as inappropriate. The author didn't object, which is why they're questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the context of the dinner (a social visit), the nature of the charge (ingredients), and the amount. The friend listed specific costs, but charging for ingredients used in a hosted meal is unusual unless prior agreement. The author's reaction\u2014paying to avoid conflict but feeling uneasy\u2014is common. Declining future invites as a response is a personal choice, but the feeling of being wronged might not be justified if the friend didn't communicate her expectations beforehand.\n\nHowever, if the friend expected to be reimbursed and didn't mention it upfront, that's on her. The author isn't obligated to pay unless there was a prior understanding. So the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction. The answer should be B (No).\n"
