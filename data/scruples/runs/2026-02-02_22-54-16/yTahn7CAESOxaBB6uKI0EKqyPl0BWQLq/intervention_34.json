I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a man was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look at his own reflection, and then staff took her side instead of the man, who claimed she bullied him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is creepy and makes her uncomfortable. Her reaction was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. Then, when he reported her, staff didn't fully support her, but another staff member confirmed the man had a history of such behavior.\n\nThe key points here are harassment, self-defense, and appropriate response. Harassment is not acceptable, and the man's actions were inappropriate. The author's response was a direct confrontation, which might have been unorthodox but was in self-defense. However, using a derogatory comment might not be the best approach in a public place where staff can get involved. But considering the man's history and the staff's eventual confirmation of his behavior, the author's intent was justified.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks she's not, but I need to be objective. Her action was a response to harassment. The staff initially took the man's side, but another staff member validated her. So, while she could have used a different approach (like reporting first), her reaction was in response to harassment. In many cases, people are advised to confront harassment, but the method can vary. Her words were direct and maybe a bit harsh, but given the context, she's not entirely at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
