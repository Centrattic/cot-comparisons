I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman at the gym dealing with a man who's staring at her inappropriately. She responds by telling him to look at his own reflection, which causes him to leave. However, gym staff then confronts her, taking the man's side, and she learns later that the man has a history of such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and decided to confront him directly. Her response was a bit confrontational but not physically aggressive. The staff's reaction seems to side with the man, possibly due to the way she addressed him, even though his actions were problematic.\n\nLegally and socially, harassment is a serious issue. The woman's reaction was a self-defense measure to stop the harassment. However, using a confrontational approach might have led to the staff's mixed response. But given the situation, her intent was to stop the unwanted behavior. The staff's failure to address the man's history and taking her words as bullying might indicate a flaw in their judgment. \n\nThe key points are: the man's inappropriate behavior, the woman's right to feel unsafe, and her attempt to address it. While her wording was direct, it was a response to harassment. The staff's handling was poor, not necessarily the woman's actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
