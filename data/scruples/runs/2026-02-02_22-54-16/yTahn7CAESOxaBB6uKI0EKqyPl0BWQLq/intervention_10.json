I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a man was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own \"tits,\" and then gym staff took her side over the man's complaint.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him first. When that didn't work, she confronted him, which is a valid response to being harassed. The comment she made was a direct retort to his behavior, using humor or sarcasm to deflect the situation. \n\nHowever, the gym staff's response is key here. They took the man's side, possibly because they didn't have evidence of harassment and only received the man's complaint. The staff might have felt that the author's language was inappropriate, even if her intent was to stop harassment. \n\nLegally, if someone is being harassed, they have the right to defend themselves. But in public spaces like gyms, staff might have policies against aggressive language. The author's response was confrontational, which could be seen as escalating the situation. However, given the context of harassment, her actions might be justified as self-defense. \n\nThe other staff member later confirmed the man was known for such behavior, which adds weight to the author's side. The problem here is that the first staff member didn't have the full context when making the decision. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might have different views on whether her response was appropriate. Some might see it as a justified stand against harassment, others might think she should have reported it to staff first instead of confronting him directly. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a reaction to being harassed, which is not her fault. However, the gym's policy might require handling such situations through staff, not direct confrontation. But given that the harassment was subtle and the man was known for it, her response was understandable. Therefore, I think the author is not in the wrong.\n"
