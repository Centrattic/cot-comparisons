I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in her early 20s) is in the wrong for insulting a man she considered creepy at the gym. The situation involves the man staring at her and her responding with a sarcastic comment about him looking at his own reflection.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The man was walking very slowly on a treadmill next to her, staring at her chest, not her face. She approached him and asked if he wanted something, but he just grunted and kept staring. She then told him to go look in the mirror, which caused him to leave. Later, gym staff took her side but she was reprimanded for her language. However, another staff member revealed the man had a history of such behavior.\n\nKey points to consider: the man's actions were unwelcome and possibly harassing. The woman felt uncomfortable and self-conscious. Her response was direct and confrontational but might be seen as using a harsh comment. However, she was responding to a situation where she was being made uncomfortable, and the staff later confirmed the man had a pattern.\n\nLegally and ethically, harassment is a serious issue. The woman's reaction was in self-defense against unwelcome attention. While her language might be considered inappropriate, the context justifies her frustration. The staff's initial response was inadequate, possibly due to bias or not taking her complaint seriously. The second staff member's confirmation adds weight to her side.\n\nPossible counterarguments: She could have reported him immediately instead of confronting him. However, given the man's subtlety and the staff's prior inaction, she might not have known who he was. Also, she might have felt unsafe or lacked confidence to escalate immediately.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman's actions were a response to harassment. While her wording could be seen as harsh, the context of being targeted by someone with a known pattern of inappropriate behavior supports her reaction. The staff's handling was flawed, but she's not in the wrong for defending herself.\n"
