I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at a gym where a woman is being stared at by a man, and she responds with a comment about him looking at his own reflection. Then the gym staff took the man's side, but later found out he's known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was staring at her inappropriately, and she felt uncomfortable. She confronted him, which led to him leaving. However, the staff then reprimanded her for talking to him that way. The author is questioning if her reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being stared at inappropriately is creepy and unwelcome. The woman's right to feel safe and to respond to harassment is important. But the way she responded might be an issue. Using a confrontational remark, even if it's a put-down, could be seen as aggressive. However, given the context of harassment, her reaction might be a form of self-defense against someone violating her personal space and comfort.\n\nThe staff's response is problematic because they took the harasser's side without understanding the context. The fact that the man was known for this behavior adds more weight to the woman's actions being justified. The staff's failure to address the harassment properly is part of the problem here.\n\nIn terms of rules, gyms often have policies against harassment, but if the staff is inadequately handling reports, it's their fault for not protecting members. The woman's response was a reaction to ongoing harassment, which could be seen as reasonable given the lack of support from the staff. However, in some places, direct confrontation might not be advised, and reporting through proper channels is better. But in the moment, when the staff isn't immediately available, her reaction makes sense.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The man was the aggressor, and her comment was a response to his behavior. The staff's failure to support her is a separate issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
