I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look in the mirror at his own body, and then got reprimanded by staff.\n\nFirst, the guy's behavior was inappropriate. Staring at someone's body without consent, especially when it's obvious and uncomfortable, is a problem. The author tried to ignore him but eventually felt the need to act when he didn't stop. Her response was direct, but maybe a bit confrontational. She used a sarcastic retort, which might have been meant to get him to leave quickly. \n\nThe staff took her response as bullying, even though the guy had a history of such behavior. The other staff member later validated her by saying he's known for this. So, the staff didn't take her side initially, which is a problem. The author's intent was to stop harassment, which is justified. However, the way she did it could be seen as aggressive. Some might argue she should have reported him immediately instead of confronting him, but in the moment, people might react spontaneously. Considering the guy was being subtle and the staff had failed to address it before, her action might be seen as self-defense. \n\nOn the other hand, using a derogatory comment could escalate the situation and might not be the best approach in a public setting. However, given the context, her reaction was in response to harassment. The key here is that the other party was the one initiating the inappropriate behavior. The author's action was in self-defense, and the staff's failure to address it properly adds to the complexity. So, I think she's not in the wrong because she was responding to harassment, even if the method could be debated.\n"
