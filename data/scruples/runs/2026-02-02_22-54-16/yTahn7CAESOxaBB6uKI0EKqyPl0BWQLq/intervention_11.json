I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves the author being stared at in a creepy way by a man, who then gets insulted and leaves, but the staff sides with the man.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where someone was making them uncomfortable with inappropriate staring. The man's behavior was subtle but clear\u2014staring at her without engaging in the treadmill, not even looking at her face. The author tried to ignore it at first but then confronted him when it became obvious he wasn't going to stop. Her response was to tell him to look at a mirror and stare at his own, which led to staff intervening.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's intention was to stop someone who was making her uncomfortable. Her response was direct and aimed at ending the harassment. However, using a derogatory comment might have escalated the situation or left a negative impression. But given that the man was being inappropriately stare at her, her reaction could be seen as a form of self-defense in a social context.\n\nThe staff's reaction is also interesting. They took the man's side, which might indicate a bias or lack of proper training in handling harassment complaints. The fact that another staff member later confirmed the man's history of inappropriate behavior supports the author's claim that he was the aggressor.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's not appropriate to use insults, the situation might have justified a strong reaction given the harassment. The author was in a vulnerable position, trying to exercise in a space where she felt unsafe. Her response, while maybe not the most tactful, was a way to assert herself against someone who was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, there's also the consideration of workplace policies and how gym staff handle such incidents. The author might have been in the wrong if the gym's code of conduct prohibits verbal confrontation, even in cases of harassment. But given the context, it's more about the staff's failure to address the harassment properly rather than the author's actions.\n\nSo, weighing the facts, the author's action was a reaction to being harassed, and while the method might not be perfect, the underlying issue is the harassment. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
