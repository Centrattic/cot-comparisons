I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman at the gym confronts a man who is staring at her, and she tells him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff then sides with the man, reprimanding her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The man is described as a creep, in his late 30s/early 40s, staring at her and not using the treadmill properly. The woman, feeling uncomfortable, confronts him. Her response was to tell him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. The staff then sides with him, leading to her leaving the gym.\n\nThe key points here are the man's behavior, which is likely inappropriate and harassing. The woman's reaction is a defense against that harassment. However, the question is whether her response was in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she was being harassed, and her reaction was direct but not violent. She was trying to put an end to the uncomfortable situation. On the other hand, her response involved a crude and potentially offensive remark that could be seen as aggressive. Staff might have seen her words as inappropriate, especially if they were supposed to maintain a respectful environment.\n\nBut considering the context, she was reacting to being stared at in a way that made her uncomfortable. She didn't initiate the harassment. The staff's response seems to side with the harasser, which is problematic. However, the woman's use of a confrontational and possibly vulgar comment might be seen as crossing a line, even if it was in self-defense. The staff might be enforcing a policy that prohibits such language, regardless of the provocation.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the man was clearly in the wrong for the staring and harassment. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most appropriate method, was a reaction to being harassed. The staff's handling of the situation is questionable, as they should address the harassment rather than side with the aggressor. \n\nSo, considering that she was the victim of harassment and her response, while maybe not the best approach, was a direct confrontation of the issue. The real fault lies with the man and the staff's inadequate response. Therefore, the woman isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
