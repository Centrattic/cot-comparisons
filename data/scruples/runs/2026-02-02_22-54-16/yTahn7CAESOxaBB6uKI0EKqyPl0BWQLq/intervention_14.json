I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a man staring at her, which she confronts by telling him to go look at his own reflection. Staff then side with him, but another staff member reveals he's known for such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him, then asked him what he wanted, but he continued. Her response was to tell him to look in the mirror. That's a confrontational but not physically aggressive reaction. \n\nLegally, she wasn't violating any laws by speaking to him. The issue is more about social norms and how the gym handles such situations. The staff took his side initially, which might indicate some bias or poor judgment. But she did use language that could be seen as offensive, even if in response to harassment.\n\nOn one hand, she had a right to feel unsafe and respond to unwanted attention. On the other hand, her approach might not have been the best method, as it led to conflict with the staff. However, the fact that another staff member confirmed the man's history suggests her actions were justified in protecting herself.\n\nThe key points are: she faced harassment, responded in a way to end the situation, and the gym's handling was inadequate. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
