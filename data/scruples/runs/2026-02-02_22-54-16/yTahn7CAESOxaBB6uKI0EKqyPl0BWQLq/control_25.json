I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman was at the gym, and a man was staring at her inappropriately. She confronted him and told him to look at his own reflection. Then, staff took her side and told her to stop. But later, another staff member revealed the guy was known for such behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether her reaction was justified. She was dealing with harassment, which is a serious issue. The man's actions were inappropriate, and she felt threatened. Her response was to confront him in a way that was direct but maybe not the most staff-approved method. \n\nThe key points here are consent and harassment. The man was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable. She had a right to defend herself. However, using a confrontational approach might not be the best way to handle it, as it could escalate things. But in the moment, she might not have had the presence of mind to involve staff immediately.\n\nGym staff's initial response was to side with the harasser, which is problematic. But the woman's intention was to protect herself from harassment. The line between self-defense and aggression can be thin here. However, given the context of harassment, her reaction seems understandable. \n\nThe staff later confirmed the man was known for such behavior, which adds support to her side. So, she was justified in her reaction. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
