I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that a man was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look in the mirror, and then gym staff took her side. The author is unsure if her reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was described as acting inappropriately, staring at her, and being creepy. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him but eventually confronted him. Her response was direct and maybe a bit harsh, but it's clear she was in a stressful situation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone is being harassed or made to feel unsafe, they have the right to defend themselves. However, the gym's policy might require reporting incidents to staff first. The author didn't do that immediately, which could be why the staff took the man's side initially. But given that the man was known for such behavior, maybe the staff should have handled it differently.\n\nEmotionally, the author's reaction is understandable. Being stared at in a public place can be really unsettling, especially if it's persistent and unwanted. Her comment, while blunt, might be seen as a justified response to harassment.\n\nBut then, from a social or ethical perspective, using insults might not be the best approach. However, in the moment, people react based on their feelings. The key here is that the man was being inappropriate, and the author was defending herself against that.\n\nThe gym staff's response is also questionable because they sided with the man. If he's known for this behavior, the staff should have taken action against him. The fact that they couldn't ban him before might indicate that the gym isn't handling such issues properly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author was responding to harassment. Her reaction was a form of self-defense against unwanted attention. While the gym staff might have protocols, the man's known behavior adds context that the staff should consider. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The main issue is the man's behavior and the gym's handling of it.\n"
