I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves the author confronting a man who was staring at her, leading to a conflict with gym staff.\n\nFirst, the man's behavior: he's described as a creep, in his late 30s/early 40s, staring at the author's chest instead of her face, and being unresponsive when she asked what he wanted. The author felt uncomfortable and finally snapped with a sarcastic comment, which made him leave. Then, the gym staff took the man's side, saying she shouldn't have spoken to him that way. Another staff later confirmed the man had a history of this behavior but was hard to catch.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the right. Let me consider the angles. Confronting harassment is important. The man's actions were inappropriate, and the author had a right to feel unsafe. However, the method of confrontation\u2014insulting him\u2014might be seen as not the best approach. Gym policies often have specific procedures for handling issues, like reporting to staff immediately. But the staff didn't take her side initially, possibly because they didn't witness the harassment, only the verbal exchange. The author might have escalated the situation by responding with a joke rather than reporting it right away. However, given the man's subtlety in his behavior, it's hard to prove unless witnessed. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was a direct response to being harassed. She felt the need to protect herself in the moment. The effectiveness of her response is debatable, but her intent was to stop the harassment. The gym staff's initial failure to support her despite the man's history is a problem. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions were a reaction to being harassed. While the method could be questioned, the underlying issue is the man's behavior. The staff's handling of the situation also raises concerns. Overall, the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against harassment, even if the delivery was confrontational.\n"
