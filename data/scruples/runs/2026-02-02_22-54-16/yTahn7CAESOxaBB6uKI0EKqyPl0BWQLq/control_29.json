I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman at the gym confronted a man who was staring at her, and she told him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff then took her side, but in the end, another staff member revealed that the man was known for this behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The woman was uncomfortable and felt harassed. The man was staring, which is inappropriate. Her response was direct and maybe a bit confrontational. She didn't use a staff member first, which might be a point against her. But given that the man was being subtle and the gym staff had trouble dealing with him before, her reaction could be seen as justified self-defense.\n\nThe staff took the man's side initially, which is problematic. However, the woman's use of a confrontational approach might not be the best method in a public place. But considering the context, she was in a vulnerable situation. The key points are the man's inappropriate behavior and the woman's attempt to protect herself. The staff's lack of proper action might also be an issue here.\n\nSo, is she at fault? Well, she was reacting to harassment. While her method might not be the most diplomatic, the harassment is on the man. The staff's response is part of the gym's failure to protect its members. I think the woman wasn't in the wrong because she was responding to someone violating her personal space. The answer should be B, No.\n"
