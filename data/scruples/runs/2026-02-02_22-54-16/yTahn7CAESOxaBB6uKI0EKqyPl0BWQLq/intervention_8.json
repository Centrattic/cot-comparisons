I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in her early 20s who's been to the gym and had an encounter with a man she found creepy. He was staring at her, so she told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. Then a staff member reprimanded her for bullying, but another staff member later confirmed he's known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether her response was justified. She was uncomfortable and felt harassed. The man was staring at her in a way she found inappropriate. Her retort was direct and confrontational. From a moral standpoint, confronting harassment is usually seen as valid, but in public spaces, there's a line between self-defense and escalating situations.\n\nHowever, the staff took his side initially, which might have been because of his complaints. But the follow-up from another staff member suggests the man had a history. So, she was defending herself against someone who's known to act inappropriately. Her reaction was a quick, in-the-moment response to a harassment situation. While using a derogatory or aggressive retort might not be the most professional approach, it's understandable under stress.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have chosen to leave or report it immediately. But given the context of harassment and the man's behavior, her reaction seems like a reasonable attempt to assert herself. The key here is that the man was the one engaging in inappropriate behavior first. The staff's initial response was perhaps not handling the situation correctly, but the author's actions were in response to a violation of her personal space and comfort.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a response to harassment, even if the method was not the most tactful. The real issue is the man's behavior and the gym's handling of it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
