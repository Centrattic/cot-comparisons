I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy man at the gym. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe woman was at the gym, the gym was empty, and a man started staring at her. She turned off her treadmill, asked him what he wanted, but he kept staring. She got annoyed and told him to look in the mirror. He left, but then staff came and said she bullied him because he claimed she didn't want him using the treadmills. She left, but another staff member told her that the guy was known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man was being creepy and inappropriate. She responded by telling him to look at his own reflection. The staff took his side, possibly because they didn't want to escalate or because they were using a policy that prohibits confrontations, even if the initial behavior was wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. On one hand, using a rude comment might not be the best approach in a professional setting where staff might have rules about how members interact. On the other hand, she was being harassed, and her reaction was in self-defense. However, the staff might not be in a position to take sides without more evidence, so they might have to follow a strict policy to maintain order.\n\nIn some cases, workplaces have zero-tolerance for aggressive or disrespectful behavior from customers, even if the customer was being harassed. But the staff also has a duty to address harassment. However, if the staff member didn't witness the harassment, they might not have enough information to take her side immediately. The second staff member did know about the guy's history, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the woman's approach was direct and confrontational, which could be seen as inappropriate in a public setting, especially where there are protocols for handling such situations. She might have been better off reporting it to staff immediately instead of confronting him directly. However, given the man's behavior, her reaction was understandable as a way to protect herself in the moment.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the staff's policy prioritizes customer safety over maintaining a non-confrontational environment. If the staff's job is to prevent harassment, then they should support her. But if their policy is to avoid confrontations, they might side with the man to prevent escalation. However, in many places, harassment isn't tolerated, and the staff should address it. The fact that another staff member later told her about the man's history suggests that the staff wasn't entirely unbiased.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman was in a stressful situation. While her response was direct, it led to a conflict with staff. If the staff's primary role is to handle such situations, then the woman might be seen as in the right for defending herself, but their policy might have forced them to take a neutral stance. However, the man's behavior was clearly inappropriate, so the woman's reaction was a response to harassment.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she was responding to harassment. But the staff's policy might have made them take the man's side to avoid liability. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether the staff handled it correctly. The woman's actions were a reaction to harassment, which is a valid reason, so she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
