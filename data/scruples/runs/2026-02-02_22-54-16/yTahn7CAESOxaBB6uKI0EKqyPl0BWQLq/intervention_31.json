I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her inappropriately. The situation is that the man was on a treadmill next to her, moving very slowly, and staring at her chest. She confronted him, and when he didn't respond appropriately, she made a sarcastic comment, which made him leave. Then a staff member told her to stop, but another staff member revealed the guy had a history of such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman felt uncomfortable and was being objectified or harassed. Her immediate reaction was to confront him. The man's behavior was inappropriate, and she tried to handle it herself. The key points here are intent and proportionality. \n\nWhen she asked, \"Can I help you with something?\" and he just grunted, that's a clear sign of not engaging. Then her response, while direct and perhaps a bit harsh, was in response to his inappropriate behavior. The humor or sarcasm in her comment might be a defense mechanism. \n\nBut the staff took his side, which is concerning. Maybe the gym's policy is strict about how members interact, even if one person is being harassed. However, another staff member confirmed the guy's history, so maybe the first staff was misjudging the situation. \n\nIs she in the wrong for using a verbal retort to stop harassment? Arguably, she's defending herself. However, if the gym's policy is to report such incidents to staff, there might be a procedural issue. But the man was being subtle about his behavior, making it hard to report without direct confrontation. \n\nAlso, the comment she made could be seen as a humorous jab, but depending on the gym's environment and policies, it might not be the recommended approach. However, given that the man didn't respond to her initial question and was persistent, her escalation might be understandable. \n\nIn similar situations, sometimes people are advised to report rather than confront directly, but that's easier said than done, especially in a public setting where the person might not take the complaint seriously. The author's intent was clearly to stop the man's behavior, which she succeeded in doing. \n\nThe staff's reaction to take his side is problematic, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since her actions were in response to harassment, I think her reaction is justified. The gym should have handled it better, but the author isn't at fault for defending herself. \n\nSo, the answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
