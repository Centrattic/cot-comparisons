I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for insulting a man who was staring at her inappropriately at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The woman was at the gym, which was mostly empty. The man was on the treadmill next to her but moving so slowly it wasn't really exercise. He was staring at her, specifically at her chest, not her face. She asked him what he wanted, he just grunted and kept staring. She felt uncomfortable and told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own \"tits.\" Then a staff member accused her of bullying, but another staff member later confirmed that the man was known for this subtle inappropriateness.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense and appropriate response. The woman felt harassed. The man's behavior was inappropriate, and she was trying to protect herself. Her response was direct and confrontational, which could be seen as justified given the situation. However, using a sarcastic or insulting remark might be considered provocative, depending on the context and the policies of the gym. \n\nGym policies often have guidelines about interactions between members. If the staff took the man's side initially, maybe they have a strict policy against confrontational language, even if the underlying behavior was wrong. But the second staff member validated her concern, indicating the man had a history. \n\nI need to weigh whether her response was reasonable. She was in a situation where she felt threatened and used a direct response to end the harassment. Even though her words were harsh, the intent was to stop the unwanted behavior. The second staff's confirmation suggests that the man's behavior was indeed problematic. \n\nSo, considering she was defending herself against harassment, even if her method was not the most polite, it might not be her fault. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
