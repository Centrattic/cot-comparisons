I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation involves the guy staring at the author, which she finds uncomfortable. She confronts him by telling him to look at the mirror instead, and then gets reprimanded by staff who took the guy's side.\n\nFirst, the guy's behavior is a key point. He's described as staring at her chest, not trying to make eye contact with her face, and being slow on the treadmill. That sounds like harassment or at least inappropriate behavior. The staff later confirms he's known for this kind of stuff, which adds context. \n\nThe author's response was to insult him. She could have called staff immediately, but she chose to confront him directly. Confronting someone in a public place with a sarcastic remark might be seen as a low-level response, but it's not physical or violent. The problem arises when she's told by staff to stop, which implies she violated gym rules by speaking to him in that manner. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong: If the gym's policy prohibits harassment but also has rules about how members should handle conflicts, maybe she should have reported the guy instead of confronting him. However, the staff's initial response of taking the harasser's side is problematic. The author was defending herself against unwanted attention, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe line between self-defense and bullying can be thin here. She used a sharp comment, which might be considered appropriate in the moment for her comfort. But if the gym has strict codes of conduct, her response could technically be against the rules. The staff's subsequent info that the man was known for this behavior complicates things. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a mix. Legally, she might not be at fault because the man was the aggressor. However, procedurally, if the gym requires reporting issues to staff rather than handling them directly, then maybe she violated that. But given the circumstances, her actions were reactive to harassment. The answer might depend on the gym's specific policies. Since the staff later admitted the guy was a known problem, the gym's handling is also questionable. \n\nOverall, the author's reaction was a form of self-advocacy in a situation where she felt targeted. While she could have handled it differently, her intent was to stop harassment. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nAnswer: B\n"
