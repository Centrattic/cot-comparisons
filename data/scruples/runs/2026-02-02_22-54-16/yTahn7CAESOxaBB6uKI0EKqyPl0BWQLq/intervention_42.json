I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is a young woman at the gym, which she's just started going to. She's self-conscious but trying to be consistent. Then a man comes to the treadmill next to her, walks very slowly, and stares at her breasts instead of her face. She asks him what he wants, he grunts and keeps staring. She feels uncomfortable and tells him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own \"tits,\" which shocks him into leaving. Later, staff confronts her for bullying him, but another staff member confirms he's known for this behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are harassment, the man's behavior being inappropriate, and the author's response. The author's insult was a direct reaction to being stared at in a creepy manner. The gym staff initially took the man's side, but it's later revealed that he's a known harasser.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The man was violating the author's personal space and privacy by staring inappropriately. That's a form of harassment, even if it's not physical. The author's response was to confront him with a sarcastic remark. While the language used might be considered harsh or offensive, the context is a clear case of someone being creeped out. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the harassment. The method she used, while perhaps not the most professional or polite, was a self-advocacy action in an uncomfortable situation. The staff's initial reaction seems to have been biased, possibly not recognizing the harassment. The fact that another staff member later confirms the man's history supports the author's claim.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author was defending herself against an unwelcome and creepy behavior. While the gym's policy might require reporting through official channels, the author's immediate reaction was to address the situation in the moment. It's important to balance personal safety and comfort with institutional policies. The author's action was a response to a violation of her personal space, and in such cases, people often act instinctively to protect themselves.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions were a legitimate response to harassment, even if the method was confrontational. The gym's staff should have supported her after understanding the context. Answer B.\n"
