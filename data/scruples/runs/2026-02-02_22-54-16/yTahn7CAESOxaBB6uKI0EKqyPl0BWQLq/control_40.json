I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that the author was working out, and this older man was on the treadmill next to her, very slowly moving, and staring at her. She asked him if he needed help, he just grunted, and she then told him to look at his own reflection. The staff took his side, saying she shouldn't talk to people that way. Another staff later told her the guy was known for that behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author felt uncomfortable and threatened. The man was being inappropriately attentive, which is a form of harassment. She tried to ignore him initially but then confronted him when he kept staring. Her response was direct but maybe not the most appropriate in terms of gym policy. However, the staff's reaction seems to have been biased, taking the man's side despite his repeated behavior. \n\nLegally and ethically, harassment is not acceptable. The man's actions were inappropriate. The author's response was a form of self-advocacy, but using a derogatory comment might not be the best approach in a public place, even if it's in response to harassment. The gym's policies probably encourage reporting such incidents to staff rather than direct confrontation. However, the staff's failure to address the man's prior behavior might indicate a lack of proper handling. \n\nSo, the author's main goal was to stop the harassment. Her method was direct but perhaps not the most effective or compliant with gym rules. However, given that the staff didn't back her up and the man was known for this, her actions can be seen as a justified reaction to harassment. The key point is whether her response was a reasonable self-defense against an uncomfortable situation. In many contexts, standing up against harassment is seen as right, even if the method isn't perfect. The gym's staff should have handled it appropriately by supporting the complainant. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the responsibility lies more with the gym and the perpetrator.\n"
