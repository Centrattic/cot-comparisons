I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by insulting a creepy guy at the gym. So, the situation is that the guy was staring at her inappropriately, and she told him to look in the mirror instead. Then the gym staff took her side, but another staff member later said the guy had a history of such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was uncomfortable and felt harassed. The guy was staring at her, not making eye contact, just focused on her body. She tried to ask him if he needed help, but he didn't respond appropriately. Then she made a sarcastic comment, which shocked him and made him leave. The staff initially took his side, but another staff confirmed the guy had a history.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the author justified in her reaction? In many places, harassment is a serious issue, and people have the right to feel safe in public spaces. The author was in a vulnerable situation, maybe self-conscious, and the guy's behavior was creepy. Her response was a direct but verbal confrontation. It's possible that she could have reported him immediately, but she might not have known the staff would be unhelpful. Also, the staff member later validated her concerns, which suggests the guy was indeed problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, using a derogatory comment like \"stare at your own tits\" might be seen as aggressive. However, in the context of being harassed, her response was a form of self-defense. The staff's initial reaction was to side with the harasser, which could indicate institutional issues rather than the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering the harassment she experienced and the lack of immediate support, her reaction seems justified. She was protecting herself from an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
