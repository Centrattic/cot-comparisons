I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong after insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The author is a woman in her early 20s who was uncomfortable with a man staring at her breasts. She confronted him, told him to look in the mirror for his own, and then the gym staff took her side. The question is if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy was staring inappropriately, and the author felt threatened. Her response was direct and confrontational. The staff took his side, which complicates things because their judgment might be biased or not understanding the harassment.\n\nLegally, public harassment is a concern. Staring in a sexually suggestive way can be considered harassment, especially if it's persistent and intentional. The author's response was an immediate reaction to being made uncomfortable. However, the way she responded might not be the most appropriate method. Insulting someone could lead to escalation, but in this case, it worked because the guy left. \n\nBut then, the gym staff's reaction is problematic. If they side with the harasser, that's a failure on their part to address the issue properly. The author might not have done anything wrong, but the staff's response could have been more supportive. \n\nThe key points are: the harasser's behavior is inappropriate, the author's response was a direct confrontation, and the staff's handling was inadequate. The author might not be in the wrong because she was defending herself against harassment. However, using that kind of language might be seen as aggressive, but given the context, it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the harassment was real, and her reaction was a response to that. The gym's failure to handle it correctly is their issue, not hers. She had a right to feel unsafe and took action to protect herself, even if the method could be debated. The core issue is the inappropriate behavior of the other person and the gym's lack of support.\n"
