I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is at fault for insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her. The situation involves the man staring at her chest, which she confronts by telling him to look in the mirror. The gym staff took the man's side, saying she bullied him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The man is described as an older guy in his late 30s/early 40s who was walking very slowly on the treadmill next to her, staring at her instead of his own treadmill. The woman turned off her treadmill to confront him, asking what he wanted. When he continued to stare, she made a sarcastic comment, which he left. However, the staff member believed the man's complaint over hers, leading her to leave the gym.\n\nThe key points here are harassment and appropriate responses. Staring at someone's body inappropriately is a form of harassment, especially if it's persistent and makes the person uncomfortable. The woman's response was direct and confrontational, which might be seen as a justified self-defense in a public space where she felt unsafe. However, using a derogatory comment could be considered aggressive or offensive, even if the intent was to stop harassment.\n\nIn many places, workplace harassment policies (which can apply to gyms as public spaces) encourage reporting incidents to staff rather than confronting perpetrators directly, to avoid escalation. The woman might have been advised to inform the staff first. However, she did report the behavior after the fact, and the staff's response was to take the man's side, which is problematic. Additionally, the second staff member confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior, implying the gym was aware but hadn't taken action.\n\nLegally and ethically, the man's behavior is the clear issue here. The woman's reaction, while perhaps not the most tactful, was in response to harassment. However, the way she addressed it might have crossed into aggressive behavior, depending on the context. The staff's failure to protect her and address the harassment is a significant factor. \n\nIn terms of fault, the woman isn't at fault for defending herself against harassment. The man's actions were the root cause, and the gym's staff handled the situation poorly by not supporting her. However, the woman could have chosen a different approach, like immediately reporting the behavior to staff, which might have been more effective and avoided the confrontation. But given the circumstances, her reaction is understandable and justified as a means to protect herself.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer leans towards the woman not being in the wrong. The choice is between options A (yes) and B (no). The correct answer is B.\n"
