I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a guy at the gym who was staring at her. The woman felt uncomfortable because the man was staring at her chest instead of his own face. She told him to look in the mirror at his own \"tits,\" and then gym staff got involved.\n\nFirst, the man's behavior is creepy and inappropriate. Staring at someone in a way that makes them uncomfortable is not okay. The woman had the right to feel unsafe and to want to address it. However, her response was an insult, which could be seen as verbal aggression. The gym staff took his side, which is frustrating, but maybe their policy is about handling conflicts without escalating them.\n\nBut wait, the woman was being harassed. The staff might be trying to mediate, but if they failed to protect her from someone known for inappropriate behavior, that's a problem. The woman's reaction was direct and maybe not the most constructive, but given the situation, it's understandable she felt the need to act. The staff's response seems to side with the harasser, which is wrong. So, is the woman in the wrong for speaking up, or is she reacting to harassment?\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to report harassment rather than confront it themselves. However, she might have felt no other option at the moment. The key issue is whether her response was disproportionate. Insulting someone, even if they're creepy, could lead to being reprimanded by the gym. But given the context, her reaction was a form of self-defense against harassment. The gym's failure to handle the harasser properly is also a point. So, I think the woman's actions were a justified response to harassment, and the gym's staff handling it poorly. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
