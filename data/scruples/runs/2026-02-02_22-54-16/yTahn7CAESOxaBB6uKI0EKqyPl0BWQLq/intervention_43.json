I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy gym-goer. The situation involves a woman confronting a man who was staring at her inappropriately.\n\nFirst, the man's behavior is clearly inappropriate. Staring at someone's body without consent is a form of harassment. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him initially, but when he continued, she confronted him. Her response was direct but not violent\u2014she used a sarcastic remark to tell him to look elsewhere. \n\nNow, the gym staff took the man's side, which is concerning because they failed to address his misconduct. The second staff member later confirmed the man's history, indicating a pattern of inappropriate behavior. This suggests the gym might not be handling such situations properly.\n\nThe key points here are the man's harassment, the author's reasonable reaction to a threat, and the gym's inadequate response. The author's words, while blunt, were a reaction to harassment in a public space. Legally, she might be within her rights to defend herself from harassment, especially in a situation where she felt threatened. However, the gym's rules might require reporting incidents to staff rather than confronting individuals. \n\nBut considering the man's known behavior and the lack of staff intervention, it's possible the author had valid reasons to act. The staff's initial response seems to side with the harasser, which could indicate a lack of proper training in handling harassment reports. The author's reaction, while not the most formal, was a response to an ongoing violation of her comfort and safety.\n\nIn terms of morality and social acceptability, the author's action was a justified response to harassment. The gym's failure to address the man's behavior is a bigger issue. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
