I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman at the gym is being stared at by a guy who's clearly looking at her inappropriately. She confronts him, tells him to look at his own reflection, and then a staff member takes her side over the creepy guy. But another staff member later tells her that the guy is known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the woman's reaction was appropriate. She was being harassed, right? Staring at someone's body without consent is a form of harassment. The woman tried to ignore him at first but then stood up for herself. Her comment was a bit confrontational but not physically aggressive. The gym staff, however, took the guy's side, which is concerning because he's known for this behavior.\n\nThe key points here: the guy's actions were inappropriate. The woman responded in a way that made him leave. The staff didn't handle it correctly, possibly due to the guy's history. The question is about whether the woman was in the wrong for her response.\n\nIn terms of legal or social norms, people have the right to be safe in public spaces. The guy's behavior was not okay. The woman's response, while direct, might be seen as a reasonable reaction given the situation. However, some might argue that she should have escalated it to staff immediately instead of confronting him herself. But considering the staff's failure to address it properly, maybe her action was justified.\n\nAlso, the staff's reaction is part of the problem here. If they side with the harasser, the onus isn't entirely on the victim. The woman's intent was to stop the harassment, which is valid. So, overall, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
