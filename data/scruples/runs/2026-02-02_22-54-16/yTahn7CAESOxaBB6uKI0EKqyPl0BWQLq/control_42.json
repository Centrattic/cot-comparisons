I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: a woman at the gym is being creeped on by a man who's staring at her. She confronts him, tells him to look at his own reflection, and he leaves. Then a staff member reprimands her for bullying, but another staff member later confirms the guy was known for this behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her response was justified. The woman was uncomfortable and used a sarcastic remark to get him to stop. The other staff member says the guy was a known creep, but the first staff took his side.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, she was defending herself against harassment. However, her method involved insulting him, which might be seen as aggressive. But considering the context, it's a self-defense reaction. The staff's response was inadequate, which complicates things.\n\nLegally and ethically, confronting harassment is understandable. The woman had a right to feel unsafe. However, gym policies might prioritize maintaining order, even if the staff's judgment was biased. But since the guy had a history, the gym's initial handling was flawed.\n\nSo, she isn't entirely at fault. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because her actions were a response to harassment, even if the method was confrontational. The real issue is the gym's failure to handle the situation properly.\n"
