I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman at the gym is being stared at by a man in his late 30s/early 40s. He's on the treadmill next to her, not really exercising, and staring at her. She turns off her treadmill to confront him, and when he doesn't respond appropriately, she insults him, telling him to look at his own reflection. Then, the gym staff sides with the man, saying she bullied him, but another staff member later confirms he's known for this kind of behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her breasts, which is a form of harassment. She tried to ignore it but eventually confronted him because it was making her uncomfortable. Her response was to tell him to look at his own reflection, which is a bit of a sarcastic retort. The gym staff took his side, possibly because of the way she addressed him. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she was a victim of harassment, and her reaction was a way to defend herself in the moment. On the other hand, using an insult like telling him to look at his own \"tits\" might be seen as aggressive or unprofessional, especially in a public place. However, given the situation, her response was a direct reaction to being harassed. Also, the staff's failure to address the man's behavior properly is problematic. \n\nBut the key point is whether her response was justified. Since the man was being inappropriate, her reaction was in self-defense. The staff's handling of the situation seems flawed. She might have handled it better by informing a staff member first, but given the circumstances, her reaction was a reasonable way to assert herself. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
