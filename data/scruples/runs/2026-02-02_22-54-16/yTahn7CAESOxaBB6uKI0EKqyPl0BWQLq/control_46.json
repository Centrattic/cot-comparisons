I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling a creepy guy to look at his own reflection. \n\nFirst, the context: the guy was staring at her breasts on a treadmill, she confronted him, he didn't back off, so she responded with a sarcastic comment. Then staff took her side but also told her to stop talking to people like that. Another staff member later confirmed the guy was a known creep.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy was being inappropriately invasive, which is harassment. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to address it. She used sarcasm as a response. The gym staff took his complaint more seriously than hers, which is problematic because he's the one who was harassing her. However, the author's response was verbal and not physical. \n\nNow, legally, in many places, verbal harassment is a thing, but the response can be tricky. If she used a derogatory term, even as a retort, that could be seen as harassment too. But in this case, she told him to look in the mirror, which is a humorous way to point out his own behavior. However, the exact wording might matter. \"Stare at your own tits\" is a bit crude but not necessarily abusive. It's a form of verbal confrontation, which can be self-expression but might be considered inappropriate in some settings.\n\nThe gym's policy might require reporting such incidents to staff rather than handling it oneself. But the staff didn't support her initially, which is a problem. The other staff member did validate her, so the gym's response was inconsistent.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? She was reacting to harassment. Her response was a verbal defense, which isn't physical. However, depending on the gym's rules, they might have wanted her to report instead. But the guy was the aggressor here. The staff's reaction was part of the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. She had the right to feel safe, and the guy was violating that. Her response was justified in terms of protecting herself. However, the method of confrontation might not be the most appropriate according to institutional policies. But the gym's handling was flawed. \n\nSo, is she at fault? Probably not. The main issue is the environment that allows harassment and doesn't support victims. Her response was a reaction to being harassed, so the answer is B.\n"
