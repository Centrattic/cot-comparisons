I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman at the gym who confronts a man she perceives as a creep for staring at her. She insults him, telling him to look in the mirror and stare at his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was self-conscious and went to the gym alone, which might make her more sensitive to unwanted attention. The man was on a treadmill next to hers, staring at her in a way she found uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him, turned off her treadmill to confront him, but he didn't stop. Then she made a sarcastic remark, which shocked him into leaving. However, the gym staff took the man's side, claiming she bullied him for not wanting him to use the treadmill. Later, another staff member reveals that the man is known for this kind of behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the woman is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, it's about personal boundaries and appropriate reactions. The man's behavior\u2014staring inappropriately\u2014is problematic. The woman was within her right to feel uncomfortable and to try to address it. However, her response was to insult him, which might be seen as aggressive, even if she felt threatened. Gym staff might not see it as harassment unless there's a clear policy in place. The staff's reaction could be based on maintaining order without escalating conflict. But the woman's intent was self-defense against harassment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man's actions were inappropriate, so the woman was protecting herself. The staff's response might be flawed because they didn't address the harassment but instead focused on her words. However, the woman could have reported him directly instead of confronting him. But given the situation, her reaction was a way to stop the harassment immediately. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, she's not violating any rules by defending herself, but the gym might have policies against confrontations. However, the man's behavior is the real issue here. The answer might hinge on whether the woman's response was reasonable given the harassment she experienced. If the gym didn't handle it properly, that's their fault. The woman's intent was to stop harassment, so she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
