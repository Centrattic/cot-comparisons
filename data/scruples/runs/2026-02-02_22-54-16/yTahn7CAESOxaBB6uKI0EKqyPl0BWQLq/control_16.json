I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The key points to consider are the context, the actions taken, and the gym's response.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is at the gym, feels uncomfortable because a man is staring at her inappropriately. She confronts him, he doesn't respond, so she retorts with a sarcastic comment. The gym staff then sides with the man, accusing her of bullying. Another staff member later reveals the man has a history of such behavior.\n\nNow, to assess if she's in the wrong. The man was being creepy, invading her personal space, and staring inappropriately. Her response was to tell him to look at his own reflection. While her wording might be considered harsh or inappropriate by some standards, her intent was to stop a harassing situation. However, from a strict policy perspective, gyms often have rules about how to handle conflicts\u2014reporting to staff rather than confronting individuals directly. So, even though she was defending herself, using insults might not align with the gym's procedures.\n\nBut then, the staff's reaction seems biased. They took the man's word over hers, which is a problem. However, the question is about whether the author was wrong, not the gym's handling. The man's behavior was clearly inappropriate, and she had a right to feel threatened. Her verbal response might be seen as a form of self-defense in an uncomfortable situation. \n\nIn many places, there's a legal concept called \"reasonable response.\" Her actions, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, could be considered a reasonable reaction to harassment. However, using a derogatory term might escalate the situation and could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate, depending on local policies. The staff's instruction to stop what she was doing suggests the gym prioritizes de-escalation methods over verbal confrontation, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was wrong to act in self-defense. \n\nOn the other hand, if the gym has a clear no-harassment policy and expects staff to handle incidents, then she might have acted against those policies. Yet, the man's behavior was the initial wrongdoing, and her reaction was a direct response to that. The fact that another staff member later confirmed the man's history complicates things, indicating the gym's initial response was flawed.\n\nSo, balancing the context: her reaction was a response to harassment. While not the most ideal approach, her intent was to end the uncomfortable situation. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where the method could be questioned. However, given the circumstances, the primary responsibility lies with the man's inappropriate behavior, and her response, while perhaps not the best, was a form of self-advocacy.\n"
