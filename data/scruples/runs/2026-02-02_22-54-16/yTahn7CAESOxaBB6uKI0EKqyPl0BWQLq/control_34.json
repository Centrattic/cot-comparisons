I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is at the gym, the man is nearby, staring at her breasts. She confronts him and says something sarcastic about mirrors and his own body. The staff then sides with the man, accusing her of bullying.\n\nSo, from my understanding, the key points here are the man's behavior and the woman's response. The man was clearly being inappropriately in his staring, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to address it directly. Her response was a bit confrontational, using a sarcastic remark. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, harassment is a problem, and the man's behavior is the issue here. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most professional way to handle it, was a reaction to being harassed. However, the staff didn't believe her and took the man's side, which adds another layer of injustice.\n\nEthically, when someone is being harassed, they have the right to defend themselves. The woman's statement was a form of self-defense in a way, but it might not be the best approach in a public setting with staff present. She could have reported him immediately, but she might not have thought of that in the moment. \n\nThe staff's response is also questionable because they didn't validate her experience. The second staff member later confirms the man's history, which shows that the first staff didn't handle it properly. So, the woman's actions were a reasonable reaction to harassment, even if the method was a bit confrontational. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man's actions are definitely wrong. The woman's response is a justified reaction to being harassed, even if the words she used could be seen as harsh. The staff's failure to support her is also an issue. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
