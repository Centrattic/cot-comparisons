I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a woman was at the gym, and a man was staring at her. She confronted him by telling him to look at the mirror and stare at his own body. Then the gym staff took her side based on the man's complaint, but another staff mentioned the man has a history of inappropriately staring at women.\n\nFirst, the man's behavior is definitely creepy and inappropriate. Staring in a way that makes someone uncomfortable, especially focusing on their body parts, is not acceptable. The author felt her boundaries were crossed, which is valid. \n\nNow, the question is whether her response was wrong. She used a sarcastic and possibly harsh comment. But given the context, she was in a stressful situation, trying to protect herself from harassment. The staff initially took the man's side, which might indicate some bias or failure to address the harassment properly.\n\nThe key points here are: the man's actions were inappropriate, the author's response was a reaction to being harassed, and the gym's response was inadequate. The author might have had better options, like involving staff immediately, but given the environment and the man's subtlety, she might not have had the chance. Her comment, while direct, was a way to defend herself in the moment. \n\nThe staff's reaction is also concerning because they prioritized the man's complaint over the woman's experience. This might imply a systemic issue where harassment isn't taken seriously. The author's reaction, while not the most professional, was a self-defense mechanism against harassment. So, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
