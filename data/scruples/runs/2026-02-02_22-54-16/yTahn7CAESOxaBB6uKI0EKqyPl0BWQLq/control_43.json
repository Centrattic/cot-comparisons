I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman at the gym who was being stared at by a man, who was looking at her inappropriately. She confronts him by telling him to look at his own reflection, which makes him leave. However, gym staff then approach her, take the man's side, and ask her to stop what she was doing. Another staff member later reveals that the man is known for such behavior but hasn't been banned because he's subtle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was appropriate. She was in a situation where she felt uncomfortable and unsafe. The man was staring at her in a way that was making her uneasy. Her reaction was direct but not violent. She used a sarcastic retort to confront him, which led to him leaving. The key question here is whether her words constituted bullying or were a justified response to harassment.\n\nIn many places, there are laws protecting individuals from harassment, and the man's behavior could be considered harassment. The woman's response might be seen as self-defense against his unwanted attention. However, the gym staff's reaction is also a point to consider. They took the man's side, possibly due to the perception that her language was inappropriate, even if her intent was to stop harassment. \n\nBut the staff's failure to address the man's known behavior is problematic. If they knew he had a history, they should have acted more decisively. The woman's response, while confrontational, was in reaction to a hostile environment created by the man. It's possible that her words, though harsh, were a necessary reaction to end the situation.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, using words to confront harassment might not be illegal, but in a public place like a gym, there might be rules against aggressive language. But given the context of harassment, her response could be seen as justified. The staff's failure to support her might be due to bias or not handling harassment reports properly.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the woman was defending herself against unwanted attention. Her response was direct but not physically harmful. The staff's side-taking might be due to misunderstanding the situation or not prioritizing the harassment complaint. Therefore, she is not clearly in the wrong.\n"
