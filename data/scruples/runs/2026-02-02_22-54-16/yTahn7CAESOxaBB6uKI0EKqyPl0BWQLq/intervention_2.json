I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves harassment, so first, I need to consider the context of the harassment. The guy was staring at her in a creepy way, which is a form of unwanted attention. She tried to ignore him but when he didn't stop, she confronted him. Her response was to tell him to look in the mirror and stare at his own, which shocked him into leaving.\n\nNow, the staff took his side, which is a problem because they should have addressed the harassment. The other staff member later confirmed that the guy was known for such behavior. So, the main issue is whether her response was justified. \n\nIn many places, there are laws against harassment, and victims are allowed to defend themselves. However, the way she responded might have escalated the situation. While her intent was to stop the harassment, using a derogatory comment could be seen as inappropriate, but considering the context, it's a direct response to harassment. The staff's failure to support her is another layer here. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The key points are that she was being harassed, her response was to stop the harassment, and the gym's staff didn't handle it properly. While her words might be seen as confrontational, the situation justifies her reaction as self-defense against harassment. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
