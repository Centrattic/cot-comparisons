I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a guy at the gym. The situation is that a man was staring at her, so she told him to look at his own reflection. Then, gym staff took her side? Wait, no, actually the staff member took the creepy guy's side. Wait, the user wrote that the staff member said she can't talk to people like that. Wait, but another staff member later told her that the guy was known for this behavior.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman was in a public place, the gym. The man was staring at her inappropriately. She felt uncomfortable, asked him what he wanted, and when he didn't respond appropriately, she retorted with a sarcastic comment. Then, the gym staff took the guy's side, which confused her. But later, another staff member confirmed the guy was known for such behavior.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, in many places, harassment is illegal. However, the woman's response was verbal. She used a sarcastic or insulting remark. But was her response appropriate? \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is harassing you, responding in a firm way to deter them is often considered reasonable. However, the line between self-defense and aggression can be blurry. The woman used a direct and confrontational approach. But was that aggressive? The comment was a bit provocative, but given the context, it's a common retort when someone is being objectified.\n\nThe gym staff's reaction is also a point. They asked her to stop, implying that her response violated gym policies. But if the gym is aware that the man has a history of inappropriate behavior, maybe they should have handled it differently. \n\nAnother angle is whether her response escalated the situation. However, in this case, the man left after the comment, so maybe it didn't. She didn't physically confront him, just used a verbal retort. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that she should have reported him immediately instead of confronting him. But given that she was in an isolated area and the man was being overtly inappropriate, her immediate reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were in response to harassment. Her reaction might not be the best approach in terms of following gym rules, but morally, she was defending herself against unwanted attention. The gym's staff response seems inadequate, as they didn't address the harassment but instead reprimanded her. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her reaction was a form of self-defense against harassment. However, there's a nuance in that the gym's policies might have been clear about how to handle such situations, but that's more about the gym's failure than the author's. So, answer B (No).\n"
