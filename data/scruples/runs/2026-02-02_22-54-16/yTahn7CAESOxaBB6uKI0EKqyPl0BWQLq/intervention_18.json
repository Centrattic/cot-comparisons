I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The story is about a woman who felt uncomfortable because a man was staring at her, and she responded by telling him to look in the mirror. The gym staff then reprimanded her based on the man's complaint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him, but when he continued, she confronted him. Her response was a sarcastic comment that made him leave. However, the staff took the man's side, leading her to question if her reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the man's behavior is clearly inappropriate. Staring at someone in a sexualized manner without consent is harassment. The woman's right to feel safe in a public space like a gym is important. Her response, while direct, was a reaction to being harassed. However, the way she addressed it might have been unprofessional or not the best approach, but given the circumstances, her intent was to stop the harassment.\n\nGym policies might prioritize maintaining a respectful environment for all members, but in this case, the staff didn't address the underlying harassment. The woman was defending herself against someone who was violating her personal space and comfort. While her language might be seen as harsh, the context of harassment could justify her reaction. It's a tricky balance between respecting others and protecting oneself from misconduct.\n\nIn conclusion, while the woman's method of confrontation could be debated, her intent was to stop harassment. The man was in the wrong for his behavior, and the staff's response seemed to overlook that. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
