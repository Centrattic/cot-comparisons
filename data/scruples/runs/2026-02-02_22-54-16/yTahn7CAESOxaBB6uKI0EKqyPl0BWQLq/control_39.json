I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy man at the gym. The scenario is that the man was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look at the mirror, then staff took his side. The user wants to know if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is at the gym, dealing with a man who's staring at her inappropriately. She confronts him, which he doesn't respond to, so she uses a sarcastic comment to get him to leave. Then, when staff comes in, they side with the man, but another staff member later tells her that this guy is known for such behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man's inappropriate behavior, her response, and the gym staff's handling. The author is conflicted\u2014she feels justified but also wonders if she should have handled it differently.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Legally, there's a line between free speech and harassment. If she made a comment that was aggressive or threatening, maybe, but in this case, she made a sarcastic remark. However, the gym's policy might prioritize de-escalation. But morally, she was responding to harassment. The staff's initial reaction seems to have misjudged the situation, but the second staff member validated her.\n\nEthically, she's defending herself against unwanted attention. While her response was direct, it's a common way people handle such situations. The gym's policy might not account for the harassment aspect. The man's behavior was the initial wrongdoing. So, the woman's reaction, though perhaps not the most professional, was a response to harassment. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's in a public place where she's supposed to follow certain rules, maybe using a more direct report to staff would be better. However, given the man's subtle harassment, she might not have had the chance to involve staff before confronting him. The fact that another staff member later supports her shows her actions were warranted.\n\nSo, considering all, the answer would be B (No), because she was responding to harassment, and while her method might be debated, the blame isn't on her.\n"
