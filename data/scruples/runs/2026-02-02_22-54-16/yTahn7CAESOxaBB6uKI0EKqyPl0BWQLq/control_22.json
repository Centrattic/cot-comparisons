I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. The woman was at the gym, and a man was staring at her. She asked him what he wanted, he didn't respond properly, and she told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own. Then staff came and took her side after explaining the man's history. \n\nSo, the main points are: was her reaction appropriate? She was dealing with harassment or unwanted attention. The man's behavior was creepy and inappropriate. She felt uncomfortable and tried to handle it herself. The staff initially took his side, but later another staff member informed her about his history. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about self-defense of her personal space and dignity. Insulting someone can be seen as a form of self-defense when someone is violating their personal boundaries. However, using potentially aggressive language might be a point of contention. But considering the context\u2014he was being creepy, and she felt threatened\u2014her reaction might be justified. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have involved staff immediately instead of confronting him herself. However, staff didn't act until after the incident. Also, given that the staff later confirmed the man's behavior was known, maybe they didn't take her complaint seriously at first. \n\nSo, the woman's actions were a response to harassment. She was in her right to protect herself from the unwanted attention. The staff's initial reaction was to side with the harasser, which is a problem. But the key is whether her insults crossed a line. The phrase she used was direct and confrontational, which might be seen as justifiable given the situation. \n\nIn such cases, people often debate between standing up for oneself versus following proper channels. Since the staff didn't act proactively, her direct action might be seen as necessary for her own comfort and safety. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
