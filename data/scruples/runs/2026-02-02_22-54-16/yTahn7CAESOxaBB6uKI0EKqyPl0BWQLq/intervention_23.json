I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that the author was being stared at by a man who was walking very slowly on the treadmill next to her. She confronted him, he didn't respond, and then she told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own body. The staff took his side, but later told her that he's known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where someone was harassing her. Being stared at inappropriately can make someone feel uncomfortable and unsafe. The author's response was direct and confrontational. But was it justified?\n\nFrom a legal perspective, public places like gyms have rules about harassment. The staff's initial reaction was to take the other person's side, which might be due to not seeing the full context. However, the author's insult could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive. But considering the harassment she was experiencing, her reaction was a form of self-defense in a way.\n\nSocially, there's a debate about how to handle harassment. Some might argue that the author should have immediately informed staff or left the area, rather than confronting the man directly. Others might say that she was within her rights to stand up for herself, especially since the staff later confirmed the man's behavior.\n\nThe key points are: the man was harassing her, she confronted him after he didn't respond to her question, and the staff's initial judgment was based on the man's complaint without full context. The author's response, while direct, was a reaction to being harassed. The staff later validated that the man had a history of such behavior, which complicates the staff's initial assessment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions were in response to harassment. While her language was strong, the context of being targeted might justify her reaction. The staff's failure to address the man's behavior appropriately also plays a role here. So, it's not entirely the author's fault. The man's behavior was the root issue, and the staff's handling of the situation was flawed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
