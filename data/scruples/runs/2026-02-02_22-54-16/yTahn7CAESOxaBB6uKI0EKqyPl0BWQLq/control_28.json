I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a woman who was being stared at by a man, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by telling him to look at his own reflection, which shocked him and made him leave. However, the gym staff then approached her, taking the man's side, and she ended up leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and decided to confront him. Her response was to make a sarcastic comment, which led to the staff reprimanding her, even though another staff member later confirmed the man had a history of such behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the man's inappropriate behavior and the woman's response. The man's actions are clearly wrong, but the woman's reaction could be seen as a form of self-defense in a way, since she was trying to protect herself from harassment. However, using a potentially aggressive or offensive comment might be seen as crossing a line, depending on gym policies. The staff's response was to side with the man, which is problematic, but the woman might have escalated the situation by her comment rather than reporting him immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, she felt threatened and acted to stop the harassment. The staff's failure to address the man's behavior properly is also an issue. The question is whether her response was justified. Legally and ethically, dealing with harassment can be tricky. While verbal confrontation is a personal choice, it might not be the best approach in a public space where staff need to handle such issues. However, given the context, her reaction is understandable as a way to reclaim her space and safety.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the woman's actions were a reaction to harassment. While her method might not be the ideal approach, the responsibility for the harassment lies with the man. The staff's handling of the situation was flawed, but the woman's intent was self-protection. Therefore, she's not in the wrong, but the answer might depend on cultural or institutional policies. However, from a moral standpoint, she's justified in defending herself against harassment.\n"
