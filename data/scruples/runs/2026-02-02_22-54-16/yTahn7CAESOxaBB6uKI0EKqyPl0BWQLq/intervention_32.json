I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a guy at the gym who was creepily staring at her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation as described. The guy was staring at her chest, not her face, which is clearly uncomfortable and harassing. She tried to ignore him but eventually confronted him. Her response was to tell him to look in the mirror and stare at his own. \n\nNow, the key points here are about harassment and appropriate responses. In many places, staring in a sexually harassing way can be considered a form of harassment, especially if it's persistent and makes someone uncomfortable. The author's reaction was direct, which might be seen as self-defense or standing up for herself. However, the staff took the guy's side, which is concerning, but maybe they have policies against personal confrontations.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of how she addressed the issue. Insulting someone could be seen as a form of bullying or verbal aggression, even if the other person was being inappropriate. Depending on the gym's policies, they might prioritize maintaining a non-confrontational environment, so the staff might have wanted her to report the harassment instead of confronting the man directly.\n\nOn the other hand, the staff later confirmed that the guy was known for such behavior, implying that the gym management might not have handled it properly. The author's reaction was a direct response to a situation that made her uncomfortable, and given the staff's lack of support, her frustration is understandable.\n\nI need to balance the harassment the author experienced against the method she used to address it. While the guy was clearly in the wrong for staring, the author's response was a direct verbal confrontation, which might not align with the gym's policies. However, in the context of self-defense and dealing with harassment, her reaction could be seen as justified.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the gym's policy states that members should report issues to staff rather than handle them personally, then she might be at fault. However, if the staff failed to address the harassment properly, that's on them. The author's primary action was defending herself against harassment, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, I think the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to harassment, and the gym staff's handling of the situation was inadequate. Her reaction, while direct, was a reasonable response to being made uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
