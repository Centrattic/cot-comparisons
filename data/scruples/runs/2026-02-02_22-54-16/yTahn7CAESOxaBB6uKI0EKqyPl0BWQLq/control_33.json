I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a woman in her early 20s at the gym. Another man is nearby, walking very slowly on the treadmill. She feels he's staring at her, specifically her chest. When she confronts him, he doesn't respond appropriately. She insults him by telling him to look at a mirror and his own chest. Then, gym staff sides with him, accusing her of bullying. Later, she learns that he's known for such behavior, but staff can't act because he's subtle.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man was allegedly harassing her by staring inappropriately. She responded with a verbal retort. The staff took his side, but another staff member later reveals he's known for this behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether her response was wrong. To determine this, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the man was being creepy, making her uncomfortable. On the other, she used an insult which might be seen as aggressive. However, the context is important. She was in a situation where she felt harassed. She tried to ignore him, then confronted him. When he didn't stop, she responded. But the gym staff didn't support her, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man was engaging in inappropriate behavior. The author's reaction was to stand up for herself. While the insult might not be the most professional approach, it's a reaction to harassment. The staff's response seems inadequate because they didn't address the real issue\u2014the man's behavior. The fact that another staff member confirmed the man's history of inappropriateness supports the author's perspective.\n\nBut legally and in terms of gym policies, maybe the staff is bound to maintain order, and if the author used a harsh insult, they might take that into account. However, the man's actions were inconsiderate and possibly illegal if harassment. The author's response, while not the most diplomatic, was a direct reaction to being harassed. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to harassment. The staff's failure to handle the situation properly is a bigger issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
