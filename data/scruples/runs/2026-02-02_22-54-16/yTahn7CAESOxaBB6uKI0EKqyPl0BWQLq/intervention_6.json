I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman at the gym who was being stared at by a man, and she responded with a sarcastic comment. The staff took the man's side, but another staff member later confirmed he's known for that behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman felt uncomfortable and was being harassed. She confronted him, which led to staff involvement. The question is whether her reaction was justified.\n\nThe author's argument is that her response was appropriate given the harassment. The other side might say she shouldn't have insulted him and should have reported it directly instead of confronting him. \n\nI should consider the context. The man was being creepy and not taking her initial question seriously. Her comment was a direct response to his staring. While using a derogatory remark might not be the best approach, the harassment was ongoing, and she felt threatened.\n\nAlso, the gym staff didn't handle it well. They believed the harasser over her. The other staff member confirmed the man had a history. So maybe the staff's response was part of the problem. The author's actions, while maybe not the most professional, were in self-defense against harassment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally, harassment is a serious issue. The woman was defending herself. However, using an insult might not be the best method. But considering the situation, her reaction was understandable. The staff's failure to address the known harasser is also a problem. So the author is not entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
