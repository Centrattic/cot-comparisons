I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her inappropriately.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a young woman, was at the gym. Another man was using the treadmill next to her but was walking very slowly and staring at her, specifically at her chest. She asked him what he wanted, but he didn't respond properly. Then she told him to look at his own reflection, which made him leave. The gym staff reprimanded her for \"bullying\" the man, but another staff member later confirmed that the man was known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man's behavior was creepy and inappropriate, the author felt uncomfortable and acted in self-defense, and the gym staff initially took his side due to her response. The staff later admitted the man had a history of such behavior but couldn't take action because he's subtle.\n\nNow, considering the ethics: The author was in a situation where she felt unsafe. Her response, while harsh, was a direct confrontation to a man who was making her uncomfortable. The problem here is whether her response was the right way to handle it. Insulting someone can escalate the situation, but in this case, the man left, so maybe it worked. However, using a derogatory comment might not be the best approach. The staff's reaction was to side with the man, possibly due to the nature of the comment, even though the man's behavior was wrong.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. Legally, she was within her right to ask someone to stop staring, but the way she did it involved a personal insult. Ethically, she had the right to feel safe, but the method might be debatable. The gym's response was problematic because they didn't address the man's behavior, which is more concerning. The author's action was a reaction to harassment, so while her method may not be ideal, the core issue is the man's inappropriate behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the staff's handling was flawed.\n"
