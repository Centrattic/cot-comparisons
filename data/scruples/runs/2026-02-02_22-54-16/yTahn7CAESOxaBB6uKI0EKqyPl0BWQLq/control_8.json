I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym who confronts a man who's staring at her. She insults him, tells him to go look in the mirror, and then the staff sides with him, making her feel she did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The woman was being stared at in a creepy way, which is uncomfortable and possibly inappropriate. Her reaction was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. The staff then reprimanded her, but later confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior. \n\nSo, the main points are: Is her reaction justified? Did she overstep by insulting him? Gym policies usually require members to report issues to staff rather than handle it themselves. If the staff told her not to speak to people that way, maybe she violated a rule. However, the man was being inappropriate, and she had a right to feel unsafe. \n\nThe staff's initial response seemed to side with the man, which is frustrating. But maybe the gym's policy is strict about how members interact. However, knowing the man had a history, the staff's later reassurance might mean the woman wasn't entirely at fault. \n\nSo, balancing the two sides: The woman had a right to feel uncomfortable, and the man's behavior was wrong. Her reaction was direct but maybe not the best approach. But given the context, her intent was self-defense. The gym staff's initial judgment might have been unfair. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman's actions were a reaction to harassment. The man was likely violating gym rules by staring inappropriately. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most tactful, was a way to address harassment. So, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But if the gym has strict rules about member interactions, she might be violating those. However, the staff later acknowledged the man's history, which complicates things. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because her reaction was to defend herself against harassment, and the man's behavior was the real issue. The gym's initial handling was flawed. So she's not in the wrong.\n"
