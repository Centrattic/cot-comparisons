I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves the author being stared at by a man, which made her uncomfortable, and she responded with a sarcastic comment. Then the gym staff took the man's side, saying she shouldn't have talked to him like that. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man was staring inappropriately, and the author felt threatened. Her response was to tell him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff sided with the man, which seems problematic. The author's main issue is feeling that her reaction was justified given the man's behavior.\n\nI should consider the context. The man's behavior was inappropriate and made her uncomfortable. The author tried to ignore him first but then confronted him when he didn't stop. The gym's response might reflect a failure to address harassment effectively. The author's comment, while perhaps not the most professional, was a direct response to being harassed.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she might not be at fault because the man was engaging in harassment. However, gyms often have rules about how members interact, so maybe the staff's reaction was based on those rules. But the staff also confirmed the man had a history of inappropriate behavior, which complicates things. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop the harassment, not to bully. The man's response to her was to report her, which is a common tactic in harassment cases where the victim is blamed. The gym's failure to address the man's behavior properly shifts the blame onto the victim in this scenario.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions were a self-defense measure against harassment. The gym's handling of the situation is questionable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
