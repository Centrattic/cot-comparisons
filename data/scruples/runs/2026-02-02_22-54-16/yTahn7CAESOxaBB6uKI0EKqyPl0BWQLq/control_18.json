I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman at the gym who felt uncomfortable because a man was staring at her. She responded by telling him to look at his own reflection, which led to staff taking her side initially but later finding out the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was in a public space, self-conscious, and faced with someone who was being creepy. Her reaction was direct but maybe a bit confrontational. The staff initially sided with the man, which is problematic because it suggests a possible bias. However, the key here is whether her response constituted bullying or was a justified reaction to harassment.\n\nThe man's actions of staring and not engaging in exercise were inappropriate. The woman's response, while using a bit of a harsh phrase, was a direct way to address the situation. The staff's initial reaction might indicate that they didn't take her complaint seriously, but later information reveals the man's history. So, the woman's intent was to stop the harassment, and her words, while possibly aggressive, were a response to being disrespected. \n\nIn such scenarios, the onus is often on the person being harassed to take action, especially if the environment isn't supportive. The woman's actions, while maybe not the most diplomatic, were a self-protective measure. The staff's failure to address the man's history might mean the woman had to take matters into her own hands. So, the answer would likely be B (she's not in the wrong) because she was responding to harassment, even if her method was a bit blunt.\n"
