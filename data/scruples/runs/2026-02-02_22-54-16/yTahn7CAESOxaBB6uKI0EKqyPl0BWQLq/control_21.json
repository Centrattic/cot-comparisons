I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being stared at by a man at the gym, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by telling him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. Then, she got reprimanded by staff for bullying, but another staff member later confirmed the guy had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are the man's behavior\u2014staring in a creepy way\u2014and the author's response. She was in a public place, which is usually a space where people should feel safe. The man's actions could be considered harassment or at least unwelcome attention. The author's reaction was direct and confrontational, which might be seen as justified given the situation. However, the staff took the man's side initially, which is problematic because they should address harassment issues. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The man was being inappropriate, and the author was trying to defend herself. Insulting him could be seen as a form of self-defense in that moment. However, using a derogatory term might be considered unprofessional or not the best approach. But given the context of harassment, it's understandable. Also, the second staff member's confirmation supports her side, implying the man had a history. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. While the method might not be the most appropriate (maybe reporting immediately would be better), her reaction was in response to being made uncomfortable. The staff's initial response was inadequate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because she was addressing harassment. The answer should be B (No).\n"
