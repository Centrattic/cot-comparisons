I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, she told him to look in the mirror, and staff took his side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable position, being uncomfortable and self-conscious. The man was staring inappropriately, which is creepy. She confronted him, which could be seen as self-defense. But staff took his side, which might be because they can't take verbal confrontations as evidence? Or maybe they have policies against aggressive language.\n\nThe key points: was the man harassing her? If he was, then her response could be justified. But the staff's reaction is also important. Were they protecting the man because they can't prove harassment? Maybe the staff can't just take sides without evidence. The author used a sarcastic remark, which might be considered unprofessional or escalating the situation. However, the man was being creepy, so her reaction is understandable.\n\nLegally and ethically, harassment is a problem. But how does the gym handle such situations? If the staff says they can't handle it because he's subtle, then the author might feel they didn't support her. But the author's response involved an insult, which might not be the best approach. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The man's behavior was wrong, but her method of confronting him might not align with the gym's policies. Maybe she should have reported him immediately instead of confronting directly. However, the staff later confirmed he had a history, so they should have acted. The question is whether her response was wrong. Since she was the victim, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the gym might have rules against aggressive language. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the man was harassing her. But if the gym has strict policies against verbal confrontations, then maybe A. Need to weigh both sides.\n"
