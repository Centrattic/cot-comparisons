I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy man at the gym. The scenario involves the man staring at her, and she responds with a sarcastic comment. Then staff took her side after he reported her. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The man was staring in a way that made her uncomfortable, which is clearly inappropriate. His behavior is a form of harassment, even if it's subtle. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which might be seen as aggressive in some contexts, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to being harassed.\n\nThe staff initially took his side, which is problematic because it shows a failure to address the harassment. However, another staff member later confirmed the man's pattern of behavior. This suggests that the gym's management might not have handled the situation correctly initially.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's response was justified. She was in a vulnerable position, facing harassment. Her comment was a direct response to the man's behavior, and while it's a strong retort, it's a form of self-advocacy. The main issue is that she should not have been in a position where she had to confront him herself. The responsibility lies with the gym to ensure a safe environment. However, her reaction is understandable given the discomfort and fear she experienced.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the man's actions are clearly wrong. The author's response is a reaction to his harassment. While her choice of words might be seen as rude, it's a form of self-defense in a social context. The staff's initial response was inadequate, but the author's actions were more about protecting her own comfort and safety.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a reaction to harassment, and the gym's failure to handle it properly isn't her fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
