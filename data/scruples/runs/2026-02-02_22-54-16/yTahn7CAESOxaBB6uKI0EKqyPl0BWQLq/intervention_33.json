I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a woman in her early 20s who's new to the gym and self-conscious. She's on a treadmill when a man in his late 30s/early 40s starts walking very slowly on the adjacent treadmill. He's staring at her, not making eye contact, and after she confronts him, he doesn't stop. She tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own \"tits,\" which shocks him into leaving. Then, staff comes and accuses her of bullying, taking his side, but another staff member later confirms the man has a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, the man's behavior is clearly inappropriate. Staring at someone in a way that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's directed at their body parts, is a form of harassment. The woman's reaction is in response to being made uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him, then asked him what he wanted, but he didn't stop. At that point, she used a sarcastic remark to get him to leave, which worked.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Gym policies might require staff to handle such situations, but the staff here didn't act until after the incident. The woman's response was a direct reaction to being harassed. While her language was confrontational, it was a form of self-advocacy in a situation where she felt unsafe. The other staff member later validated her concern, indicating the man has a history. So, the woman's action was a reasonable response given the circumstances. The gym's staff taking his side might reflect poor policy handling rather than her being wrong. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
