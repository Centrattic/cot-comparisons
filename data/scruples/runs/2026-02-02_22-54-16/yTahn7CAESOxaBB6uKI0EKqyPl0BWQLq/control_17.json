I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was at the gym, noticed a man staring at her, and responded with a comment about mirrors and his own body. The gym staff then took her side initially, but the main issue is whether she was wrong to confront him in that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was described as being in his late 30s/early 40s, staring at her breasts instead of her face, and not engaging in proper exercise. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him but eventually confronted him. Her response was sarcastic and aimed to stop his behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, there's a balance between self-defense and appropriate confrontation. The man was being inappropriately intrusive, which is a form of harassment. The author's reaction might have been a way to stop the harassment immediately. However, using a confrontational and potentially disrespectful comment could be seen as escalating the situation. \n\nBut considering that the man was being a creep and the staff later confirmed he was known for such behavior, the author's response was a direct reaction to harassment. The gym staff initially took his side, which complicates things, but the second staff member validated her experience. \n\nLegally, in many places, being subjected to harassment is unacceptable, and the victim has the right to defend themselves. However, the method of defense can matter. The author's response was verbal and might not have been the best approach, but given the situation, it's understandable. The key is whether her response was a reasonable reaction to harassment. \n\nThere's also the aspect of self-defense and de-escalation. Some might argue she should have gone to a staff member immediately, but others might say that in the moment, a direct response was necessary to stop the harassment. Since the other staff member later confirmed the man's behavior, the author's reaction was justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong because she was responding to harassment. Her reaction, while maybe not the most tactful, was a way to assert herself in a situation where she felt unsafe. The fact that the gym staff eventually validated her experience also supports that she had a legitimate reason to act as she did.\n"
