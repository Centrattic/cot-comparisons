I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The story is about a woman facing harassment from another man, and she responds by telling him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff then sides with the man, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The man was staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to address it. Her response was direct but maybe not the most appropriate method. However, the staff took the man's side, which is problematic because he was the one harassing her. \n\nLegally, the woman had the right to defend herself against harassment. However, her response involved an insult, which can be seen as aggressive. But considering the context, it's a form of self-defense in a non-physical sense. The staff's reaction is also questionable because they didn't address the harassment itself but instead reprimanded the woman for speaking out.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to be upset and want to stand up for oneself, the method of response might not be the most effective. However, given the lack of support from the staff, her reaction might be justified. The key point is that the man was violating her personal space and safety, and she acted to stop it. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the woman was responding to harassment, and while her method could be debated, the responsibility lies more with the harasser and the gym's failure to protect her.\n"
