I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look in the mirror at his own body, and then got reprimanded by staff.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The man was staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The author was uncomfortable and tried to ignore him first. When she confronted him, he didn't respond, so she made a sarcastic comment. The staff took his side, but another employee later informed her that the man was known for such behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether her reaction was justified. The key points here are her right to feel safe and the staff's handling. She was responding to harassment, which is a valid concern. However, the way she addressed it was by using an insult. Insulting someone, even if they're being inappropriate, might be seen as unprofessional or crossing a line, depending on the context. But in a situation where someone is making you uncomfortable and the staff isn't immediately helpful, self-defense in communication could be understandable.\n\nThe staff's reaction is also important. If they didn't believe her and only took the man's side, that's a problem. But the author might have been too harsh in her response. However, given that the man was being a creep and the staff didn't act properly, her reaction was a form of standing up for herself in a hostile environment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. Legally, if there was harassment, the staff should have intervened. Ethically, the author's response was a defense against harassment. However, the method she used\u2014insulting him\u2014might be considered unprofessional. But considering the context of harassment, her action is more about self-advocacy. So, likely not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any point I'm missing. The man might have escalated if she didn't respond, but she left after the confrontation. The other staff member later confirmed the man's behavior, which supports her claim. So the answer is probably B.\n"
