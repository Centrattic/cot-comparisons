I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman at the gym who confronts a man she perceives as creepy for staring at her. She insults him, which leads to staff taking her side initially but later confirming the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was uncomfortable with the man's behavior, which he was doing in a private area. She tried to address it directly by confronting him, which worked to some extent. However, when staff intervened, they took the man's side at first. The author is conflicted about whether her response was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the man's behavior was inappropriate, and the author felt harassed. Confronting someone in a public space can be tricky. While she had the right to feel uncomfortable, using a verbal jab might not have been the best approach in terms of gym policies. Gyms often have codes of conduct that prohibit harassment, but also expect respectful interactions. \n\nHowever, the man's actions were clearly the problem. The second staff member's confirmation that he had a history of such behavior suggests that the gym might not have handled it properly before. The author's response was a direct reaction to being harassed. While she could have reported him immediately, her action was an instinctive self-defense reaction to an uncomfortable situation.\n\nLegally and ethically, the man was violating her personal space and engaging in harassment. The author's response, while not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to being harassed. The staff's initial reaction might have been biased, but the second staff member's information supports her claim. So, she's not in the wrong for standing up for herself in that situation. The answer is B (No).\n"
