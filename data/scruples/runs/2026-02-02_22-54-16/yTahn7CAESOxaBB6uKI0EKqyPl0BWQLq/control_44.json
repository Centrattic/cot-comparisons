I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is at a mostly empty gym, on a treadmill. A man starts walking very slowly on the treadmill next to her and stares at her. She confronts him, and when he doesn't respond appropriately, she tells him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own body. Then, staff comes and sides with the man, accusing her of bullying. Later, another staff member reveals that the man is known for this behavior.\n\nThe key points here are about harassment and appropriate responses. The man was clearly making her uncomfortable by staring, which is a form of harassment. The woman's reaction was to confront him in a direct but disrespectful way. While the content of his behavior is wrong, her response involved using the same kind of language (insulting his appearance) to push him away. \n\nNow, the question is whether her response was justified. Legally and ethically, harassment is not okay, and victims should report it. However, the way she addressed it might not have been the best. Insulting someone in response could escalate the situation or be seen as aggressive, even if the initial action was inappropriate. The staff took the man's side, possibly because they saw her as the aggressor, but later found out the man had a history. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman was a victim of harassment. Her reaction was a form of self-advocacy, but the method might not have been the most appropriate. However, given the context, her actions were a reaction to being made uncomfortable by someone who was violating her personal space. The staff's handling of the situation was flawed, but the main issue is the man's behavior. \n\nTherefore, the woman isn't in the wrong because the harassment was the man's fault. Her response, while possibly not the best, was a reaction to an unwelcome situation. The answer would be B (No), as she's not in the wrong.\n"
