I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is at a mostly empty gym, working out on a treadmill. A man comes over and starts staring at her, not engaging in proper exercise. She confronts him but he keeps staring. She tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. Then, the staff sides with him, claiming she bullied him, even though another staff member later confirmed the guy's known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the main points here are about harassment and appropriate response. The guy's behavior is clearly inappropriate\u2014staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him, then confronted him directly when he persisted. Her response was to tell him to look at himself in the mirror, which seems like a direct but maybe not the most professional way to handle it. \n\nThe gym staff took his side initially, which is a problem because the guy's behavior is known. The staff's failure to address his behavior properly is part of the issue here. But the question is about the woman. Is her reaction justified?\n\nFrom a harassment perspective, the man was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable. She had a right to feel unsafe and to speak up. However, the way she responded could be seen as using a verbal attack, which might escalate the situation. But given that he was being a creep and she was trying to end the harassment, her reaction is understandable. Also, it worked\u2014he left.\n\nThe staff's response is another layer. They should have handled the situation more effectively, but that doesn't necessarily mean the woman was wrong. Her main goal was to stop harassment, which is a valid self-advocacy action. The question is whether her method was in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong (B), because protecting oneself from harassment is justified, even if the method was a bit confrontational. The staff's failure to support her adds to the context that her reaction was necessary.\n"
