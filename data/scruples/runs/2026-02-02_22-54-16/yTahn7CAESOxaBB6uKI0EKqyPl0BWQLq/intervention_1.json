I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym who was staring at her. \n\nFirst, the guy was walking very slowly on the treadmill next to her, staring at her breasts. She approached him, asked what he wanted, he ignored her and kept staring. She then told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own, which worked. But then staff came and took her side, supposedly taking the guy's side. Another staff later told her he's known for that behavior.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether her response was justified. She felt uncomfortable and was trying to defend herself against harassment. The guy was being inappropriate, and she used a direct, confrontational approach to stop him. \n\nNow, considering the context: she's in a public place where she has the right to feel safe. The man's behavior was invasive and unwelcome. Her response, while maybe not the most professional, was a direct way to address the harassment. The staff's reaction seems to have been biased, possibly due to institutional issues or lack of proper training in handling harassment. \n\nBut the question is if she's in the wrong. Legally, there might be a case of harassment, but the gym's staff didn't support her. Ethically, she's defending herself from unwanted attention. However, using a derogatory comment might not be the best approach in a public setting, but given the circumstances, it's understandable as a self-defense reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have involved staff immediately instead of confronting him directly, which could escalate things. But she did try to ask him politely and only escalated when he didn't respond. \n\nOverall, her actions were a response to harassment, and while the method might not be ideal, the intent was self-defense. So, the answer would be B.\n"
