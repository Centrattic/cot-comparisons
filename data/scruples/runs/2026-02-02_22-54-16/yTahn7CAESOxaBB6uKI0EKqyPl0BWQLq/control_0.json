I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a woman was at the gym, someone started staring at her, and when she confronted him, she told him to look at his own reflection. Then, the staff took the other guy's side, saying she bullied him. Now, we need to figure out if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is in her early 20s, self-conscious, and went to the gym. The other person was middle-aged, walking slowly, staring at her breasts. She confronted him, he didn't respond, so she made a sarcastic comment. The staff believed the man's side, which seems unfair, but the key is her actions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man's behavior was inappropriate. Staring at someone's body without consent is a form of harassment. The woman was trying to address it. However, the way she addressed it was by making an insult about looking at his own body. Insulting someone, even if they're a creep, could be considered harassment or bullying. But the situation is that she was the victim of harassment first.\n\nThe staff's response might be a problem because they took the man's side, but the question is about the woman's responsibility. If she used a verbal response that could be seen as aggressive, even if justified, maybe she's in the wrong. But if the man was harassing her, she had a right to protect herself.\n\nAnother angle: the woman was in a public space. How do people usually handle such situations? Reporting to staff is an option, but if the staff don't act, maybe confronting directly is understandable. However, the staff's reaction was to side with the man because of her words. So maybe her approach was not the best, but she had a valid reason. Alternatively, could she have handled it differently without being confrontational? Maybe, but she felt uncomfortable and acted in the moment.\n\nIn terms of laws or gym policies, maybe the woman violated some rules by confronting him that way. If the gym has a policy against inappropriate language or harassment, her comment might be against the rules. But the man's behavior was definitely against harassment policies.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she was responding to harassment. On the other, her response might have been inappropriate. But considering the context, her reaction was self-defense against harassment. The staff's failure to handle the creep properly is a problem, but the woman's actions might not be wrong if the man was the initial aggressor.\n"
