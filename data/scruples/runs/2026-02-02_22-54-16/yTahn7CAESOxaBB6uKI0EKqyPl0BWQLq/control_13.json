I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a woman at the gym who's being stared at by an older guy. He's on the treadmill next to her, not really doing much, and she notices he's staring at her chest. She confronts him, tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body, which shocks him and makes him leave. Then staff comes and reprimands her for bullying him, but another staff member later confirms that the guy has a history of this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's acceptable behavior. The guy's staring at her in a way that makes her uncomfortable, which is a form of harassment. She's within her rights to feel violated and react, especially in a public space where she should be safe to exercise. However, the way she reacted was by using a derogatory comment. Even if her intent was to shut down the harassment, the method might be seen as aggressive or inappropriate, even if she was the victim.\n\nThe gym staff took his side initially, which might be because they have a policy against personal confrontations. They probably want to prevent conflicts between members, regardless of the reason. But the second staff member confirms the guy's history, which complicates things. The author's reaction could be justified as self-defense against harassment, but the gym might have their own rules about how to handle such situations, like reporting it to staff instead of confronting directly.\n\nSo, the question is whether her reaction was proportionate. She was in a vulnerable situation, and her response was to use a sharp, maybe offensive comment. While the content of her message was about calling out his behavior, the manner might be seen as escalating the situation. However, given that the guy was being inconsiderate and harassing, her reaction could be seen as a reasonable response to protect herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the staff's role is to handle such issues, so maybe she should have reported him instead of confronting him directly. But she might not have had the time or opportunity to do so while the harassment was happening. The fact that the gym staff later confirmed the guy's history suggests that the initial staff wasn't aware, so maybe the author did what she had to do in the moment.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She was a victim of harassment and responded to protect herself. The gym's response might be more about following protocol than understanding the context. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
