This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being unresponsive to advice, and the parent eventually decided to send him to the shelter after selling the family home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They tried to encourage their son to get a job and consider trade schools. When that didn't work, they set a boundary by selling the house and moving away, giving him a clear ultimatum. When he still didn't change his behavior, they took drastic action. The parent's intention was to force independence, which they felt was necessary for his growth.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter, even if it's for their own good, is a severe measure. There might be ethical concerns here. While the parent wanted their son to learn responsibility, using a homeless shelter as a punishment could be seen as harsh. It's possible that there were other, less extreme ways to encourage independence, like helping him find a job or setting up a structured support system. Also, the son was an adult, so the parent's role might be more about guidance rather than control.\n\nThe son eventually did go to barber school and now lives independently, which suggests the action had the intended effect. However, the method used could be questioned. The key here is whether the parent's actions were proportionate and respectful. Some might argue that the parent overstepped by using a shelter, which is typically for people without any resources, whereas the son had his mother's support available. Others might see it as a necessary wake-up call.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most parents might not use such extreme measures, but each situation is unique. The parent's approach might be seen as tough love, but it's a thin line between tough love and being inconsiderate. The fact that the son didn't resist and eventually changed his behavior might support the parent's stance, but the method of sending him to a shelter could still be debated.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer isn't straightforward. However, given that the parent's goal was to push independence and it worked, but the method was extreme, there's a case to be made that the parent isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that there were better ways. But in this context, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to help their son grow, even if the method was harsh.\n"
