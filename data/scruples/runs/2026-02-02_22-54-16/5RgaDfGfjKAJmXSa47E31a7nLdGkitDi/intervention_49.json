This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 23, which is an adult. The parent tried multiple times to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school but he kept failing to commit. The parent tried moving away to push him out, but he didn't change. Finally, the parent sent him to a shelter to force independence.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once someone is an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. So the parent isn't in legal trouble here. But ethically? That's trickier. Some might argue that using a homeless shelter as a last resort is harsh, even if the parent feels it's necessary for the son's growth. Others might see it as a firm but necessary action to push the son towards responsibility.\n\nThe parent did give the son an opportunity after he went to barber school, which shows they care and want him to succeed. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter could have severe emotional impacts. There's also the question of whether there were other options\u2014like temporary housing, support programs, or mediation. The parent might not have considered those, but they mentioned they tried everything else.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's perspective is that they were trying to break the cycle of dependency. The son eventually succeeded, which supports the parent's approach. But it's a tough call. While the outcome was positive, the method was extreme. Different people might handle this differently. Some might say there's a better way, but given the parent's efforts over years, maybe this was their breaking point.\n\nI think the key points are the son's age, the parent's prior attempts, and the son's eventual success. The parent's actions were harsh but aimed at the son's betterment. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. However, considering the parent's intention and the positive outcome, B is likely the right choice.\n"
