This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe mom took her son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. He's 23, had a history of not keeping jobs, and was living with her. She sold her house and moved away, then sent him to the shelter. Eventually, he went to barber school and is now living on his own. The question is whether she was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone is an adult, parents aren't legally obligated to support them. So if the son is an adult, the mom isn't required to provide housing. However, sending him to a homeless shelter might be controversial. Was it necessary? There might be other options, like cutting him off financially or encouraging him to find his own place without using a shelter.\n\nAlso, the son's behavior: he was irresponsible, not keeping jobs, and not contributing. The mom tried to push him towards a trade, which he sort of did with bartending but didn't stick. Maybe there were underlying issues, like mental health or motivation problems, that weren't addressed. The mom might have thought the harsh action was necessary to make him become independent.\n\nBut sending him to a homeless shelter could be seen as overly harsh. There might be other ways to encourage independence without using a shelter. Some people might argue that this was a last resort after years of failed attempts to help him. The fact that he eventually succeeded in barber school and is now living on his own shows the method worked, even if it was extreme.\n\nOthers might say that even if the son was an adult, the mother's action of using a homeless shelter was too extreme. Maybe she could have given him an ultimatum to leave the house without involving the shelter. There's also the aspect of emotional harm. Was the son capable of handling life on his own after being sent to a shelter? What if there were other factors, like his willingness to change?\n\nThe mom felt guilty, which suggests she thought it was a tough decision. The community's response in an AITA scenario usually considers intent, alternatives, and outcomes. The outcome here is positive: the son is now working. However, the method might not be the best approach. There's also the question of whether she had to go through the homeless shelter specifically, or if she could have just cut him off and made him fend for himself without that step.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might view this as a tough love approach that worked, while others might see it as neglecting her role as a parent by not providing support. The answer might depend on the balance between accountability and support. Since the son is now doing well, maybe the method was effective, but perhaps not the only way. The question is whether she was wrong. If she had other options, then maybe yes. But if she felt it was the only way and it worked, maybe not.\n\nI think the key points are: the son was an adult, she tried to push him towards independence, the action was a last resort, and the outcome was positive. The AITA community often looks at intent and outcomes. So maybe she isn't in the wrong, but others might argue that the method was too harsh. However, since she's asking if there was a better way, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the outcome was good and she tried to help him, albeit with a tough method.\n"
