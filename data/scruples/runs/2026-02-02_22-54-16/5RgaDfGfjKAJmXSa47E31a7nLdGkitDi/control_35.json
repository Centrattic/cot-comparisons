This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The son was 23, didn't hold jobs, played games, and the mother tried to push him towards a trade. He worked a bartending job for six months, then other short-term jobs. The mother eventually sold the house and moved, then sent him to a shelter. He later went to barber school and is now on his own. \n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. Let's consider the possible arguments. On one hand, the mother is trying to push her adult son to become independent. At 23, he's an adult, so maybe she's within her rights to stop supporting him. The shelter was a last resort after years of not working. It did lead to him getting a job eventually. But on the other hand, sending someone to a shelter can be seen as harsh. Even though he's an adult, the mother is his parent, and some might argue that there are more supportive ways to encourage independence without such an extreme measure. \n\nAlso, the mother had given him multiple chances and opportunities\u2014trade school suggestions, allowing him to live at home. But when he didn't take responsibility, she had to take action. The shelter might have been a shock tactic to make him realize the need for change. However, using a homeless shelter could be considered inhumane or overly punitive. Are there other methods parents use? Maybe other forms of intervention, like cutting off financial support, requiring him to move out, or setting strict conditions for staying. \n\nThe mother's intention was to help him become self-sufficient, and it worked in the end. But was the method appropriate? Some might say that while the outcome is positive, the means were too harsh. Others might argue that it was a necessary step for him to learn responsibility. \n\nAlso, the son didn't resist when she took him to the shelter, implying he might have been expecting it. The mother felt it was the only way to force him to change. In the AITA context, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. If the son was an adult, the mother isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the emotional aspect is complex. \n\nI think the key points are: the son is an adult, the mother tried various approaches, the shelter was a last resort, and the outcome was positive. The question is whether the method was wrong. In AITA communities, sometimes the focus is on the action's harshness even if the outcome is good. But given that the son was an adult and the mother was trying to enforce independence, it's a gray area. \n\nPossible conclusion: The mother's actions were harsh but not necessarily wrong, as she was trying to encourage her adult son to take responsibility. The answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong), but some might argue A. However, considering the context and that the son eventually changed, the answer is more likely B.\n"
