This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author (a mother) is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and being unresponsive to her advice. She eventually decided to move away, sell the house, and when the house sold, sent him to a shelter. He later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, so he's legally an adult. Parents have a certain responsibility until a child is 18, but after that, it's more about guidance. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school, which is a reasonable approach. However, he didn't take it seriously, had short-term jobs, and wasn't responsible. The mother felt she had no other options and decided to take drastic action.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is harsh. Homeless shelters are for people in crisis, and using them as a punishment might be seen as crossing a line. Also, there might be other options, like giving him an ultimatum to leave the house if he doesn't get a job or pay rent. But she didn't do that; she sold the house and then sent him to a shelter, which could be seen as an extreme measure.\n\nOn the other hand, she did provide a condition for him to come back (barber school), which he accepted. The outcome was positive\u2014he became a barber and is independent. But the means she used might be questionable. Was there a more constructive way? For example, setting up a structured support system, helping him find a job or training program, or giving him a time limit to leave the house with certain conditions. Using a homeless shelter as a direct measure might not be necessary unless he's truly homeless and has no other support.\n\nAlso, the mother's motivation was to push him to become independent, which is understandable. However, the method could be seen as inhumane or excessive. Homeless shelters are for people without any resources, and she's his parent. There's a debate about parental rights versus the welfare of the adult child.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might suggest that while the intention was good, the action was too harsh. Other parents might use different methods, like setting boundaries with clear consequences (e.g., no financial support unless he gets a job) rather than sending him to a shelter. Also, the fact that she called the shelter every day until there was a spot might indicate that she knew it was a last resort but still proceeded.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's goal was to encourage independence, the method she used might be considered too extreme. The answer could lean towards her being in the wrong (A) because using a homeless shelter as a punishment isn't a standard or compassionate approach. Alternatively, if the shelter was the only option and she had tried everything else, it might be seen as justified (B). But considering typical parenting advice, the answer is likely A.\n"
