This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the son was 23 when this happened. He's an adult, so legally, he's an adult. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school. The son had a few jobs but didn't last long, and eventually, the parent had enough. They sold the house and moved, then sent the son to a homeless shelter. The parent's intention was to force the son to become independent. The son later went to barber school, became a barber, and is living on his own now.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent did take an extreme measure by sending the son to a shelter. But on the other hand, they were trying to push the son to become self-sufficient. The son was an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support him anymore. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be seen as harsh, even if it worked in the end.\n\nI need to consider the context. The parent had tried talking to the son for years, he wasn't taking responsibility. Moving away and cutting off support was a final measure. But sending him to a shelter could have been traumatic. However, the son eventually succeeded after this intervention. \n\nOther options might include cutting off financial support, not allowing him to live at home, but the shelter might be an extreme step. But the parent might not have had other options if the shelter was the only way to get him to leave. Also, the parent offered to take him back under the condition he goes to barber school, which he did.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, using a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. On the other, the parent was trying to force independence in an adult child. The parent's actions might be seen as necessary to teach a lesson, even if it was tough. But maybe there were other ways to handle it without involving a homeless shelter. However, the parent's goal was achieved, and the son is now independent. \n\nIn AITA threads, sometimes being strict with adult children isn't seen as wrong if it's for their own good. The parent's actions, while extreme, might be justified in the context of pushing an adult child to take responsibility. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
