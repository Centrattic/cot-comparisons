This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The parent's son was 23, wouldn't get a job, and they tried to push him into trade school. The son kept quitting jobs and not working. The parent sold their house and decided to send him to the shelter when he didn't move out. Now the son went to barber school and is living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once a child turns 18, they are legally adults. The parent isn't obligated to support them anymore. The son here was 23, so the parent isn't legally wrong for cutting off support. But the question is about moral or emotional wrongness, not legal.\n\nThe parent's actions were extreme. Sending someone to a homeless shelter without any prior support or resources might be seen as harsh. But the parent did reach out after a few weeks and offered help if the son went to barber school. That shows a willingness to support once the son started taking action.\n\nThe son's behavior was problematic. He wasn't working, staying with friends, and not contributing. The parent tried to talk to him and set up consequences. However, the method of sending him to the shelter might have been a last resort after other options failed. But are there other alternatives? Maybe setting up a structured support system, like requiring him to live elsewhere with a support network, or working with a counselor.\n\nThe parent's intention was to force independence, which is a parent's role. But the approach might have been too abrupt. However, given the son's history of not responding to other methods, the parent might have felt it was necessary. Whether it's right or wrong depends on cultural or personal values. Some might see it as tough love, others as abandonment.\n\nThe key points are the son's age, the parent's prior efforts, and the outcome where the son eventually improved. The parent did provide a condition for support, which helped the son turn his life around. So, while the action was extreme, it led to positive change. The parent might not be in the wrong, but there's room for debate on the method.\n"
