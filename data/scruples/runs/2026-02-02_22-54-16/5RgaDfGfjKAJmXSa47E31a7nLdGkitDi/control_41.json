This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to provide for him. But taking that step to a shelter might be seen as harsh. However, the parent did give him opportunities to get a job and set up trade school options, which he ignored.\n\nThe parent's actions were a last resort after years of the son not contributing or holding jobs. The parent even gave a condition for allowing him to come back, which he met. The key here is whether the parent had other options. Maybe the parent could have tried more supportive measures first, but given the son's consistent lack of effort, the parent might feel desperate.\n\nOn the other hand, sending an adult child to a shelter could be seen as using extreme force. The parent might have considered other options like cutting off financial support without the shelter step. However, the parent's intention was to push the son to become independent, and it worked. The son eventually got a job and is now self-sufficient.\n\nSo, the parent's actions were harsh but effective. It's a tough call, but since the son is an adult and the parent tried various methods before this, the parent might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), as the parent's actions, while extreme, were aimed at helping the son become independent, and there's no legal wrongdoing. Other parents might use different methods, but the outcome was positive.\n"
