This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. First, I need to consider the key points from the story.\n\nThe son was 23 when this happened. He had a history of not holding jobs, avoiding responsibility, and not contributing. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school, which he didn't pursue. When she decided to sell the house, she set a deadline for him to move out. Eventually, she sent him to a shelter. After that, he went to barber school and now lives independently.\n\nNow, the question is whether her actions were wrong. Legally, once someone is an adult, parents aren't obligated to support them. However, in this case, the mother is taking a drastic step. Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. But she did it to force him to become independent. The son didn't resist, which suggests he might have realized his behavior needed to change. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the mother was doing what was necessary to help him grow. Others might say that there were other, less harsh ways to encourage independence, like setting clear boundaries without using a shelter. The fact that the son eventually succeeded after this experience might support the mother's approach as effective. But the emotional impact on both of them is significant. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the shelter's capacity. The mother had to wait until a bed was available, which shows she planned this. She did offer a way for him to return under specific conditions, which shows she still cared. \n\nIn terms of alternatives, other parents might use eviction notices, financial consequences, or other forms of setting boundaries. The mother's method was extreme but effective. \n\nConsidering all this, the mother's actions are controversial but not necessarily wrong. She aimed to push her son towards independence after multiple failed attempts. The key points are intent, effectiveness, and the son's eventual success. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
