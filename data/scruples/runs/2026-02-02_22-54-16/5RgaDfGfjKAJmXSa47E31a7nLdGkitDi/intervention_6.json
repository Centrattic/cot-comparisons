This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA situation. So, the user's question is whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, which is an adult. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job and go to trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. He had jobs that didn't last, quit or got fired, and partied a lot. The parent felt they had to set a boundary by selling the house and moving, leading to the son being sent to a shelter. The son then eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they were wrong to send the son to the shelter. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parent wanted their son to become independent and took drastic measures to enforce that. The son was an adult, so the parent might be right to stop supporting him financially. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be seen as harsh. Some might argue that there are other ways to push for independence without resorting to homelessness, like cutting off financial support, setting clear consequences, or encouraging other forms of support (like government assistance, job training programs, etc.). \n\nBut the parent did try to push the son for years, and the son didn't change. The shelter was a last resort after the parent moved away, making it clear the son had to live on his own. The outcome was positive: the son got a job as a barber and is now independent. The parent's intention was to help, even if the method was extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a shelter could be seen as emotionally harmful or using fear as a motivator. However, since the son was an adult, the parent isn't legally responsible for him anymore. The parent's actions might have been a way to force the son to take responsibility without legal obligations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the outcome. The parent's intent was to help the son become self-sufficient, and the outcome was positive. Even though the method was drastic, it worked. The parent also offered a way to reconcile if the son complied with attending barber school, which he did. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent's actions, though extreme, were aimed at the son's independence, and the outcome was successful. Parents might have different approaches, but the parent's actions were within their right to set boundaries for their adult child.\n"
