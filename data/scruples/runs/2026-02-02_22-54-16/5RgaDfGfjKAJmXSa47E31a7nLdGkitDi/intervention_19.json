This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The parent's son was 23, not working consistently, and the parent eventually decided to move away and send him to the shelter. The son later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent tried multiple times to encourage their son to get a job and pursue a trade. The son didn't take their advice, which led to the parent taking drastic action. The parent's intention was to make the son independent, which worked as the son eventually found a job in barbering.\n\nBut is sending someone to a homeless shelter an appropriate measure? Ethically, it's a tough call. On one hand, the parent is trying to enforce accountability. On the other hand, using a homeless shelter as a \"lesson\" might be seen as harsh, especially since the son is their child and the parent could have other options, like temporary housing or support programs. However, the parent mentions that the shelter was full and they had to wait for a spot, implying they might not have other options at the time.\n\nAlso, the son's response was positive; he eventually got help and became independent. The parent's actions might not have been the only way, but they were effective. The question is whether the method was wrong. Some might argue that using a homeless shelter as a punitive measure is extreme and could be seen as neglectful or abusive. Others might say that the parent was within their rights to set boundaries for an adult child.\n\nLegally, parents are not responsible for their adult children, so the parent isn't legally in the wrong. But morally, it's subjective. The parent's approach might be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options. The key points are that the parent tried to communicate, set a deadline, and when that failed, took action. The outcome was positive, but the method was extreme.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention was to help their son become independent, the method might be questioned. However, given the circumstances and the son's eventual success, it's possible the parent isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that there were alternative ways to handle the situation without resorting to a homeless shelter.\n"
