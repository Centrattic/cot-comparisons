This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son wasn't working, staying at home, and not contributing. The parent tried to encourage him to get a trade, but he kept quitting jobs. The parent then decided to move away and send him to a shelter, which led the son to eventually go to barber school and get his own place.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age of the son (23, which is an adult), his responsibility to himself, and the parent's actions to enforce independence. The parent's intention was to push the son to become self-sufficient, which is a common concern for parents. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be extreme. \n\nBut wait, the parent mentions that they tried to talk to him, encourage trade schools, and even offered a condition for moving back in. The shelter was a last resort after years of the son not taking responsibility. The son eventually did take the trade school path and is now independent. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect, is it wrong to use such a drastic measure? Some might argue that the parent had the right to set boundaries, especially if the son was an adult. Others might say that sending someone to a shelter could be seen as harsh, even if the intent was good. However, the parent did provide a way out through the condition of attending barber school, which worked.\n\nThe question is whether there's a better way. Maybe alternatives like cutting off financial support without the shelter, but the parent's approach worked in the end. The son is now independent, which is the parent's goal. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions feeling guilty, which adds a layer of emotional complexity. But the outcome is positive. So, in terms of right or wrong, it's about intent and outcome. The parent's actions, while extreme, led to a positive change. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent's actions were aimed at fostering independence and the outcome was positive. However, some might argue the method was harsh, but the intent was good.\n"
