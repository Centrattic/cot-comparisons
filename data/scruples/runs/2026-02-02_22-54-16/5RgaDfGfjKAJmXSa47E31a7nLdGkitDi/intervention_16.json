This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent did the right thing by sending their son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The parent feels guilty but justified because the son eventually got a job after attending barber school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The son was 23, an adult, and wasn't contributing, quitting jobs, and not taking responsibility. The parent tried talking to him, pushing him towards trade school, but he didn't follow through. The parent decided to move away and then sent him to the shelter when the house sold. The key points here are that the son is an adult, so the parent might not have a legal obligation to support him anymore. However, parents often feel responsible for their children regardless.\n\nNext, the method of sending him to a homeless shelter. Is that an appropriate way to handle an adult child who's not taking care of themselves? The shelter was full, so the parent had to wait until there was an opening. The son didn't resist, so maybe he was expecting it. The parent's intention was to force independence. But is this fair? The parent had other options, like cutting off financial support, but maybe they felt this was necessary to shock him into action.\n\nThe outcome is positive: the son became a barber and is living on his own now. So the parent's strict approach worked in the end. But was there a better way? For example, could the parent have set other conditions, like requiring him to live elsewhere without being homeless, or maybe allowing him to stay but with strict rules? The parent might have felt that the shelter was the only way to make the son take responsibility.\n\nEthically, is it right to use homelessness as a motivator? It's harsh, but the parent's argument is that they have to let go for the son's growth. However, some might argue that the parent should have provided other forms of support or found alternative solutions without putting him in a homeless shelter. Also, the parent's guilt suggests internal conflict about the decision.\n\nAnother angle: the parent might not have considered the son's possible mental health issues or other barriers to employment. If the son had underlying issues causing his job instability, sending him to a shelter without addressing those could be problematic. But the parent described the son as just not motivated, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter a common or accepted practice? The parent says they've never heard of other parents doing that, which might imply it's extreme. However, the effectiveness here is clear, so the parent might believe it was necessary.\n\nOverall, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to push the son towards independence, and it worked. But the method is questionable. The answer might depend on whether the parent had other options and the potential harm caused by the drastic action. However, since the son is now successful, the parent might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that the parent should have handled it differently. The key is whether the parent's actions were proportionate and necessary.\n"
