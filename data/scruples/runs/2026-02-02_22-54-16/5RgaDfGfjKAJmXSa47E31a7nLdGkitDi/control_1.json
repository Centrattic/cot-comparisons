This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from the parent's perspective. The son wasn't holding down jobs, was resistant to working, and the parent felt they had to take drastic measures. The parent tried talking to him, suggested trade schools, but he kept quitting jobs. Finally, the parent sold the house and moved away, then sent him to the shelter when he didn't change his ways.\n\nBut wait, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult and responsible for his own actions. The parent might have felt they had no other options, but is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter really appropriate? There might be legal issues here. Also, homeless shelters are for people in immediate need, not as a punishment. \n\nThe parent's intention was to force the son to become independent. While that's a good goal, the method might be extreme. Are there other ways to encourage independence without using a shelter? Maybe giving him an ultimatum to move out on his own terms, or cutting off financial support. But the parent chose a public, harsh method which could be traumatic.\n\nHowever, the outcome was positive: the son went to barber school and is now independent. So, even though the method was harsh, it worked. But the question is about whether the parent was in the wrong. Ethically, using a homeless shelter as a punishment could be seen as wrong, especially if it wasn't the only option. The parent might not have considered other support systems or resources. Also, the shelter's purpose is to help the homeless, not punish adults.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might have felt desperate and did what they thought was necessary. They did give the son a chance to come back under conditions. The key points are the extreme nature of the action and the son's age. Since he's an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him, but the method used might cross a line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an extreme and potentially harmful measure that wasn't necessary. There might be better, less traumatic ways to push for independence without involving institutional settings meant for people in crisis.\n"
