This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother did the wrong thing by sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son was described as not contributing, quitting jobs, and not taking responsibility. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school, which he didn't pursue. After selling the house and moving, she sent him to a shelter to force independence. He eventually went to barber school and now lives on his own. \n\nThe key points here are the son's behavior and the mother's actions. At 23, he's an adult, so there's a line between parental responsibility and enabling. The mother's approach was extreme\u2014using a homeless shelter as a last resort. But was it wrong?\n\nSome might argue that while pushing independence is good, using a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh and potentially traumatic. It's important whether there were other options, like allowing him to live elsewhere with conditions, offering support, or seeking professional help. The mother did offer a conditional way back, which shows she wanted him to take responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, she did follow through on her ultimatum, which led to positive change. The son now has a job and lives independently. The question is whether the means justified the end. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The mother had no legal obligation to support her adult child. However, sending him to a shelter might have been a shock tactic. Alternative approaches could have been discussed, but she might have felt that was the only way he'd change.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while not common, some might see it as a necessary action for his growth. Others might find it too extreme. The answer hinges on whether the action was proportionate and if there were better methods. Since the outcome was positive, and the mother had given prior warnings, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
