This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The son was described as someone who didn't contribute, played games, had friends over, and couldn't hold a job. The parent tried to push him towards trade school but he didn't take it seriously. Eventually, the parent sold the house, moved, and when the son still wasn't working, sent him to a shelter. The son later went to barber school and is living on his own now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parent's actions and the son's age. The son is an adult, 23, which is an adult in most societies. Parents usually have a responsibility to care for their children until a certain age, but once they're adults, the expectations shift. The parent is trying to enforce independence, which is a reasonable goal. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. \n\nOn one hand, the parent is trying to teach responsibility and push the son to become self-sufficient. On the other hand, homeless shelters are meant for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure. Using a shelter in this way might not be appropriate and could be harmful. There might be other ways to encourage independence without resorting to such a harsh method. Also, the parent could have explored other options like temporary housing, support programs, or setting clear boundaries with consequences that are less drastic. \n\nThe parent's intention was to help the son learn to live on his own, which is valid. However, the method chosen was extreme. It's possible that the parent felt frustrated and didn't consider alternative solutions. The outcome was positive in that the son eventually got a job and moved out, but the means used to get there might be questionable. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's rare for parents to send adult children to shelters, it's also not uncommon for parents to struggle with enabling behavior in their adult children. The parent's approach might be seen as harsh but with the right intentions. However, there's a fine line between tough love and being inconsiderate of the son's well-being. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the method was justified. Since the son was an adult, the parent's approach could be seen as crossing a line, even if the goal was good. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there could be better ways to handle it. However, some might argue that the parent had the right to enforce independence. I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they were trying to help their son become self-sufficient, even if the method was extreme. But others might say that using a homeless shelter as a punishment is inappropriate. The final answer would need to balance these perspectives.\n"
