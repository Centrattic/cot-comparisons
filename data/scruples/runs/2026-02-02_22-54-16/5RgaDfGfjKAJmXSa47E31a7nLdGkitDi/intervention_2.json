This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's son wasn't working, was playing games, and not contributing. The parent tried to get him to go to trade school, but he didn't stick with it. Eventually, the parent sold the house and moved away, then sent the son to a shelter when he didn't change his ways. The son later went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent. The son was an adult, 23, so legally an adult. The parent felt it was necessary to take drastic action to push him towards responsibility. But is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter an appropriate method?\n\nHomeless shelters are meant for people who are homeless, not for disciplinary purposes. The parent might have thought this was a way to force responsibility, but using a shelter in this context could be seen as using a resource not intended for that purpose. Also, the son didn't have a place to go, and the parent had already moved away. The parent might have felt that this was the only way to make the son take action, but is there a better way? Maybe giving more warnings, setting other conditions, or seeking help from other resources like support groups or counseling?\n\nThe parent did try to get the son to attend trade school but the son didn't follow through. The parent's actions led to the son eventually getting a job as a barber. However, the method might be harsh. The parent could be criticized for not providing alternative support or for using a homeless shelter as a means of punishment. On the other hand, the parent's goal was to encourage independence, which is a valid concern for parents of adult children.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. It's uncommon for parents to send adults to shelters as a way to make them get their life together. It's more typical to have other strategies. The parent might have felt desperate, but the method used could be seen as extreme. However, the outcome was positive: the son became responsible. But does the end justify the means?\n\nAlso, the parent might have a legal responsibility if the son is a minor, but since he's 23, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. Still, sending him to a shelter might be considered neglectful or even abusive if it's done to harm or pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention was to help the son become independent, the method might be considered wrong because it involved using a homeless shelter inappropriately. There might be better ways to encourage responsibility without resorting to such extreme measures. So the answer would be A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
