This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The author tried various methods to encourage their son to find work and eventually felt forced to take this extreme step to push him to become independent. The son later went to barber school and is now doing well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once a child is 18, they are legally adults, and parents aren't obligated to support them. So the author isn't legally in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. The parent tried to intervene when the son wasn't taking responsibility, which might be seen as necessary for his growth. However, sending him to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. Some might argue that it's a harsh way to teach independence, especially if there are other options available, like temporary housing or support programs. But the author did mention they tried other methods first, like selling the house and setting a condition for the son's return through barber school.\n\nThe son's response was to comply and eventually become self-sufficient, which could be seen as a positive outcome. However, the method used could be seen as emotionally damaging. The question is whether there was a better, less harsh approach. The parent might have considered alternatives like cutting financial support, enrolling him in a program, or seeking professional help. But the parent felt that the shelter was the last resort, and it worked.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to use such drastic measures, which is why the author is questioning it. The key points are the son's age, the parent's previous attempts, the effectiveness of the action, and the potential emotional impact. While the outcome was positive, the method might be seen as too extreme by some. However, others might view it as a necessary step to ensure the son's independence. So, the answer might hinge on whether the action was proportionate to the problem and if there were viable alternatives.\n"
