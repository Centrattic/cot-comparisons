This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The parent has a 23-year-old son who was lazy, didn't hold jobs, and wasn't contributing. The parent tried to push him towards trade school, but he didn't follow through. After the house was sold, the parent sent the son to a homeless shelter as a wake-up call. Eventually, the son went to barber school and became independent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's actions. The parent wanted to force independence, which is a common concern for parents of adult children. But sending someone to a homeless shelter is drastic. Are there other ways to handle this? Maybe setting boundaries like requiring the son to move out after a certain period, cutting financial support, or working with a counselor?\n\nThen, the son's behavior. He wasn't working, skipping jobs, and not taking responsibility. The parent tried to set expectations, but the son didn't meet them. However, at 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally responsible for him anymore. But emotionally, the parent might still feel responsible.\n\nIs the parent overstepping by using the homeless shelter as a punishment? Maybe, but the parent's intention was to help the son become self-sufficient. The alternative was letting the son stay, which would have enabled his behavior. The result was positive: the son now works and is independent. But does the method matter? Even if the outcome is good, was the method appropriate?\n\nAlso, the parent mentions never hearing of other parents doing this. It's possible that other parents use different strategies. But in this case, the parent felt it was necessary. The son didn't resist, which might indicate he understood the consequences.\n\nThere's a line between tough love and being too harsh. The parent might have crossed that line, but in the context of the son's lack of progress, maybe not. The key here is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. Sending an adult child to a shelter could be seen as extreme, but given the son's situation, it might be justified as a last resort.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's intention was to foster independence, and the outcome was successful. Even though the method was harsh, it worked. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
