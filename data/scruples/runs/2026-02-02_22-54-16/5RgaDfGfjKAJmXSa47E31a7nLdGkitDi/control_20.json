This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent is the author of the AITA post.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The son was 23, didn't hold jobs, didn't take responsibility, and the parent felt they had to take drastic measures to push him to change. The parent sold the house, moved away, and when the house sold, sent the son to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own. The parent is wondering if there was a better way and if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is that they wanted their son to become independent. They tried talking, setting boundaries, and eventually took action when other methods didn't work. The son's behavior was problematic\u2014no job, not contributing, etc. The parent's action was extreme but led to a positive outcome, albeit through a harsh method.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter an acceptable form of tough love? Some might argue that the parent's actions were necessary to break the cycle of dependency and push the son to take responsibility. Others might argue that it's inhumane or that there are more constructive ways to handle it, like cutting off financial support without using a shelter, or seeking professional help.\n\nThe parent mentions that the shelter had limited beds, which might have been a factor. Also, the son didn't fight back, which could suggest he was already aware of the consequences. The outcome is positive in that the son changed his behavior, but the method was extreme.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to take such steps, which is why the parent is asking if others would do the same. However, the parent's intention was to help the son become independent, which is a valid goal. The question is whether the means justified the ends.\n\nI should also consider if the parent had other options. For example, could they have cut off financial support without using the shelter? Or perhaps helped the son find a job or trade school funding? But the parent tried to encourage trade school before, and the son wasn't cooperative. The parent might have felt that the shelter was a last resort after all else failed.\n\nThe key here is that the son is an adult. Legally, parents are not obligated to support adult children beyond a certain age, so this is more about ethical and moral responsibility. The parent might feel they did what was necessary for the son's growth, even if it was harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, using a homeless shelter as a means to force independence could be seen as cruel or neglectful. The shelter is a place for people without any support, and sending someone there might cause unnecessary suffering. But in this case, it worked\u2014maybe because the son was motivated by the situation to change.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method was extreme, the parent's intention was to help their son become independent, and it worked. However, the moral judgment might vary. If the parent had other resources or support systems to help the son without such a drastic step, that could be a point against them. But given the circumstances described, the parent might not be in the wrong.\n"
