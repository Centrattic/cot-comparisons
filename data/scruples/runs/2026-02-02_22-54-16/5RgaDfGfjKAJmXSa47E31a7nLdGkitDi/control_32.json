This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't hold a job. The parent tried to encourage their son to get a job or go to trade school, but he kept quitting or getting fired. After moving away and the house being sold, the parent sent him to the shelter. Later, the son went to barber school and is now independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, using a homeless shelter as a means to force independence might be seen as extreme. Shelters are for people in immediate need, not as a punishment. The parent's intention was to push the son to become self-sufficient, which is understandable, but the method could be questioned.\n\nNext, the alternatives. The parent mentioned not knowing other ways to handle it. Maybe they could have set stricter boundaries without involving the shelter, like cutting off financial support or requiring a job as a condition for living at home. Sending someone to a shelter might be traumatic and could be seen as abandoning them, even if the parent believes it's for their good.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the son's response. He eventually agreed to go to barber school and is now successful. That shows the method worked, but does the end justify the means? Some might argue that the parent overstepped by using a shelter, which is meant for those without support systems. The parent could have found other ways to motivate the son without causing that kind of distress.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The parent's goal was positive, but the method might be considered harsh. Other parents might use different strategies, like setting up structured support or requiring participation in responsibilities. However, the parent's actions led to a positive outcome, which complicates the judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the parent is in the wrong depends on the perspective. Legally, they aren't at fault, but ethically, using a homeless shelter could be seen as an extreme measure. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to help, but some might argue A due to the method used. However, given the positive outcome and the parent's efforts to push the son towards independence, the answer is likely B.\n"
