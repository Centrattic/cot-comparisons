This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's son was 23, hadn't held a job for long, and was resistant to getting a job. The parent tried various ways to encourage him, including suggesting trade school and even cutting him off financially by moving away. Eventually, when the house sold, the parent sent him to a homeless shelter. The son then went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nSo first, I need to assess the situation from different angles. The parent's actions were extreme but perhaps driven by frustration and a desire for the son to become self-sufficient. The son was an adult, so there's a line between parental support and enabling. The parent tried talking to him, getting him into a trade, and even moving away to push him out. When that didn't work, the shelter was a last resort. The outcome was positive though\u2014the son became independent. \n\nBut is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter considered wrong? Some might argue that while the parent had the intention to help, the method was harsh. Others might see it as a necessary measure to break the cycle of dependency. There's also the aspect of the parent's responsibility; once a child is an adult, especially in their 20s, the parent isn't obligated to support them. However, the parent could have explored other options like setting clear boundaries without using the shelter. Maybe legal or community resources could have been involved instead. \n\nThe parent also allowed the son to come back under the condition of attending barber school, which shows a willingness to support once the son showed initiative. The key points here are the son's age, the parent's prior efforts, the effectiveness of the action, and societal norms. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parent crossed a line in their approach. While the shelter tactic was drastic, the parent's goal was to encourage independence. Since the son is now doing well, maybe the method, though harsh, worked. However, there might be better ways to handle it without resorting to such extremes. But since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, and considering the son's adult status, the parent's actions might be seen as justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
