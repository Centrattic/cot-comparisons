This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. The parent tried various approaches, including talking to him, suggesting trade schools, and even letting him fail multiple jobs. Eventually, when the parent moved, they sent the son to a shelter. The son later went to barber school and now lives on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted the son to become self-sufficient. The parent tried different methods over years, like encouraging trade skills and setting consequences. When those didn't work, the shelter was a last resort. The parent also offered a way out (barber school) once the son was in the shelter.\n\nNow, possible ethical angles. Is using a homeless shelter as a punishment appropriate? Some might argue that it's harsh and could cause emotional harm. Others might see it as a necessary step to force independence. The parent's actions led to positive change, but the method is extreme. Also, the parent had a condition for the son to come back, which shows they still wanted his success.\n\nLegal aspects? The parent is not the legal guardian anymore since the son is 23. But the parent is still providing support, which is common. Sending to a homeless shelter might be a legal option if the parent is no longer supporting them, but it's more a social issue.\n\nSocial norms: Parents often have to set boundaries for adult children. However, using a shelter might be seen as extreme. There might be alternative methods like cutting off financial support, which is more common. But the parent did move away, which is a form of separation.\n\nThe son's perspective: He might feel abandoned, but he eventually changed. The parent's method worked, but was it fair? The key is whether the parent gave all possible support and alternatives before this. The parent did mention trade schools and the son chose bartending, which didn't work out.\n\nOther factors: The parent sold the house, which is a significant step. The shelter had limited beds, which might indicate the parent was acting in desperation. Also, the parent's own background as a barber influenced the son's choice, which shows they wanted to help him find a viable path.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method was extreme, the parent's goal was to push the son toward independence. The parent did try other methods first. However, the use of a homeless shelter could be seen as overly harsh, even if effective. But given the son's persistent lack of effort, it might be justified as a last resort. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives on parenting adult children.\n"
