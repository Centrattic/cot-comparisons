This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter. The parent's son is 23, not working, staying with friends, and not holding down jobs. The parent tried to push him towards a trade school but he didn't follow through. After selling the house and moving, the parent sent him to a shelter to force independence.\n\nHmm, the first thing to consider is the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. But sending him to a homeless shelter is pretty extreme. Are there other options? Like, maybe cutting off financial support, making him move out, or encouraging him to find a job without such drastic measures?\n\nThe parent mentions the son didn't argue, which suggests he might have been expecting this. But is using a homeless shelter a good way to teach responsibility? It seems harsh. Maybe the parent could have allowed the son to live at home but with conditions, like paying rent or contributing, to push him towards getting a job. Alternatively, setting clear boundaries and consequences without involving a shelter might have been more constructive.\n\nAlso, the parent later allows the son to come back if he goes to barber school. That shows they wanted him to improve, which is positive. However, the method used might have been too punitive. Other parents might use different strategies, like open communication, setting structured goals, or offering support while encouraging independence without using institutional settings.\n\nThe parent's guilt indicates they might feel conflicted. The key issue is whether the action was necessary and proportionate. While the parent's intent was to help the son become self-sufficient, the approach could have been more supportive. There might be better ways to foster responsibility without causing emotional distress or potential harm through such an abrupt and public measure as a shelter.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention is understandable, the method might be considered excessive. The answer could lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is an extreme action that might not be the most effective or compassionate approach. However, some might argue that the parent was trying to enforce independence (B). But given the lack of other alternatives considered and the potential for harm, probably AITA is A.\n"
