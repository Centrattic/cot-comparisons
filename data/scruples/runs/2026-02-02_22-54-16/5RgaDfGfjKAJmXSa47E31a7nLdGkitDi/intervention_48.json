This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The scenario is that the son wasn't working, was uncooperative, and after a lot of back and forth, the mother decided to send him to the shelter to force him to become independent.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the mother isn't morally obligated to support him indefinitely. However, she did take responsibility for him for a long time, even as he struggled with jobs and education. The key point here is whether her actions were justified in pushing him towards independence.\n\nThe mother tried various methods: encouraging trade school, discussing the importance of a skill, and giving him opportunities. When those didn't work, she escalated to selling the house and moving, which removed his safety net. Then, sending him to the shelter was a last resort. She did call every day until a spot opened, which shows she made an effort to find alternatives. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the son's reaction. He didn't resist when taken to the shelter, indicating he might have known it was coming. Afterward, he did change his behavior by going to barber school, which suggests that the action had the intended effect. \n\nBut wait, is sending an adult child to a homeless shelter considered appropriate? Some might argue that there are less drastic measures, like cutting off financial support or setting clear boundaries without using a shelter. However, given the son's lack of progress and the mother's frustration, she might have felt this was necessary for his growth. \n\nThe question is whether the method was wrong. The mother's intention was to force independence, which is a valid goal. However, using a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. But since the son is an adult, the mother isn't in the wrong for making tough decisions to encourage self-sufficiency. Others might have different methods, but the outcome was positive. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
