This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the mother did the wrong thing by sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nFirst, the son was 23 and had a history of not holding jobs, avoiding responsibilities, and not contributing. The mother tried to encourage him to go to trade school or find a skill, but he kept taking dead-end jobs and quitting. Eventually, she decided to move away and gave him an ultimatum. When he didn't change his behavior, she took him to a homeless shelter after selling her house. He ended up going to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the mother is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let me think about possible angles. On one hand, the son is an adult, so maybe the mother overstepped by taking such a drastic action. Sending someone to a shelter could be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to push him to become independent. But on the other hand, she tried other methods first, like suggesting trade school and giving him chances. When he didn't respond, she had to take a firm step. \n\nIs there a legal issue here? Well, since he's an adult, she can't force him to do anything, but she's his parent. However, using a homeless shelter might be within her rights if he's an adult. But maybe there are better alternatives, like cutting off financial support or making him live elsewhere. The mother did eventually allow him to come back under the condition that he go to barber school, which he did, leading to a positive outcome. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some cultures, parents might be expected to support their children longer, but in others, pushing independence is common. The mother felt guilty, which suggests she thought it was a hard decision but necessary. The outcome was positive, so maybe the means justified the end. However, sending an adult child to a shelter could be seen as emotionally abusive, even if it worked. \n\nAlternative approaches might include setting clearer boundaries without such a drastic step, like moving out entirely or cutting off support without the shelter. But the mother tried selling the house to create distance. Maybe she didn't have better options at the time. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. While the intent was to help him become independent, the method was extreme. Some might argue that the shelter was unnecessary and that other methods could have been tried first. Others might see it as a last resort after all else failed. The fact that she did it with the intention of helping and he eventually succeeded could tip the balance. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether using a homeless shelter was justified as a last resort. Since she tried other methods and he didn't respond, maybe she's not in the wrong. But others might say that the shelter was too harsh. However, given the outcome, perhaps B (not in the wrong) is the better choice here.\n"
