This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son was 23, not in college, had a history of not holding jobs, and the parent felt it was necessary to push him to independence.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to force their son to become self-sufficient. They tried other methods like suggesting trade schools and setting boundaries. When those didn't work, they escalated to the shelter. The son eventually got a job after being sent there. \n\nOn one hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, especially if there were alternatives. But the parent was trying to teach responsibility, and the son was an adult. The parent's actions led to positive change, so maybe they're justified. However, the ethics of using a shelter as a punishment could be questioned. Are there other options like letting him stay but with strict conditions? Also, the parent might have legal obligations if the son is still a dependent. But since he's 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't necessarily wrong in making him leave. The key is whether the action was necessary and the alternatives considered. Since the parent tried other methods and the outcome was positive, it's a tough call. I think the parent's intent was to help, so they might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
