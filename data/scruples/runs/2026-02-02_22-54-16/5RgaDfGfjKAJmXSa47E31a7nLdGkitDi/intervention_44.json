This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's reasoning is that the son wasn't getting a job, was lazy, and they finally had enough. They sold the house, moved away, and when the son didn't change his ways, they sent him to the shelter. The son then went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, once someone is 18, they're considered an adult. The parent isn't legally obligated to support them anymore. So, from a legal standpoint, the parent isn't in the wrong. But the ethical part is trickier.\n\nThe parent's actions were strict, but they did set boundaries. The son was given warnings about getting a job and attending trade school. The parent tried to push him towards a trade, which is a responsible approach. When that didn't work, they sold the house to create distance, which is a common strategy to encourage independence.\n\nSending the son to a homeless shelter might be extreme, but the parent did it as a last resort after years of the son not taking responsibility. The parent also gave the son a chance to come back under the condition of attending barber school, which shows a willingness to support him once he started making an effort.\n\nHowever, some might argue that using a homeless shelter as a punishment could be harmful. It might traumatize the individual or not be the most effective way to teach responsibility. There might be alternative solutions like cutting off financial support but allowing the son to stay in a transitional living situation. But the parent's goal was to force the son to become independent, which they achieved eventually.\n\nThe parent's actions, while harsh, were aimed at breaking the cycle of dependency. The son's subsequent success suggests that the parent's approach worked, even if the method was extreme. The key point is whether the parent's actions were necessary and proportionate. Given the son's long-term lack of responsibility and the parent's attempts to guide him, the action might be seen as a last resort.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method is extreme, the parent's intention was to encourage independence, which they succeeded in. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
