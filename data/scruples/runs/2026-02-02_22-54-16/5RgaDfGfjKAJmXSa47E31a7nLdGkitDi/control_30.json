This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. So, the parent in question sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, skipping out on responsibilities, and the parent decided to cut them off after selling their house and moving away. The parent wanted to force the son to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the method used here is pretty extreme. Sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. Are there other ways to encourage independence without such a harsh action? Maybe setting boundaries, like cutting off financial support, but not using a shelter as a means of eviction.\n\nThe parent's intention was to push the son to take responsibility, which is understandable. But the approach might have been too harsh. The son wasn't given any other options; he was thrown into a shelter without alternatives. While the parent eventually allowed the son to come back under the condition of attending barber school, the initial action might have been unnecessary. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions feeling guilty about it, which indicates they might have some doubts. Using a homeless shelter as a tactic could be seen as cruel, even if it worked in the end. There might be other ways to handle this, like setting clear boundaries, offering support while requiring the son to take steps towards independence, or seeking counseling.\n\nOn the other hand, the son was clearly not taking responsibility, and the parent had tried talking to him for years without success. The parent's actions did eventually lead the son to change, so maybe the intent was good. But the method was questionable. The parent should have explored other options before resorting to the shelter, especially since it's a last-resort situation for people who truly have no other options. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent had good intentions, the method they used was extreme and possibly unnecessary. There might be better ways to handle adult children's independence without using such a harsh tactic. So, the answer would lean towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
