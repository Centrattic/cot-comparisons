This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the son was 23 when this happened. That's an adult age, so legally he's an adult. However, in some cultures, people might still be living at home and expected to start working. The son had a history of not keeping jobs, quitting or getting fired from various jobs, and not being motivated to get a stable job. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school but he didn't take it seriously. She eventually sold the house and moved away, which forced him to leave. Then she sent him to the homeless shelter when the house sold. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about the possible angles. On one hand, as a parent, she's trying to enforce independence because her son wasn't taking responsibility. She might believe that by making him experience homelessness, he would be motivated to change. On the other hand, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh, even if the intent is good. There might be other ways to encourage independence without resorting to such extreme measures. Also, the fact that he eventually went to barber school and got a job suggests that maybe there was a better approach that could have led to the same result without the trauma of homelessness.\n\nBut then again, the mother might have felt that she had tried everything else. She mentions that he wasn't working, was unresponsive to advice, and continued to live off her. She had given him time to make changes but he didn't. In that case, she might feel justified in taking drastic action to push him towards independence.\n\nAnother point to consider: in some situations, parents might feel that they can't support an adult child indefinitely, especially if the child isn't contributing or making progress. The mother might be trying to protect her own life by moving away and starting fresh. However, the method of using a homeless shelter is extreme. Are there other options? Maybe setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support, but still providing a place to stay if he works towards a solution, or seeking help from social services or other community resources?\n\nAlso, the shelter had limited beds and she waited until there was an opening. That raises the question of whether she had other alternatives. If she had no other options, maybe it's a last resort. But if there were other ways to help him become independent, like encouraging him to move out on his own with a support system, perhaps that would have been better.\n\nThe son eventually did change after being sent to the shelter, but that doesn't necessarily mean the method was right. It's a success in terms of the outcome, but the means were drastic. The mother might be in the right if she's protecting her own life and encouraging her son's independence, but she might be in the wrong if she's causing unnecessary harm. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the son is an adult, the mother isn't obligated to support him beyond a certain point. She's enforcing boundaries, which can be necessary for his growth. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that other methods could have been considered. But the question is whether she is in the wrong, given the outcome and the intent. The community might have mixed reactions, but given the circumstances she described, she's trying to help her son become self-sufficient. So probably B.\n"
