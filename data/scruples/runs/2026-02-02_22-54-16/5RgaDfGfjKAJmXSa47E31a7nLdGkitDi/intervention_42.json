This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The story details the son's lack of motivation and the parent's decision to force him to become independent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The son, an adult, wasn't contributing, kept quitting jobs, and the parent tried to encourage him to get a trade. When that didn't work, the parent decided to send him to a shelter. The parent moved away, sold the house, and after the son didn't change, resorted to this action. The son eventually went to barber school and now lives on his own.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong here. The parent is an adult, and their son is 23. In many places, once you're an adult, you're responsible for your own decisions. However, the parent might not be legally wrong, but morally? The question is about being in the wrong in a social sense. \n\nSome points to consider: The parent tried to push the son towards a trade, which is a good approach. The son didn't take it seriously. The parent's decision to send him to a shelter is drastic. It could be argued that the parent was trying to force independence, which is important for adults. But using a homeless shelter as a consequence might be seen as harsh. Are there other options? Like cutting off financial support, giving ultimatums without such strict measures?\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they never heard of other parents doing this. It might be that others use different methods, which could be more constructive. However, the parent's intention was to make the son take responsibility. The outcome was positive; the son became a barber and is living on his own. So, the method worked, but was it necessary?\n\nEthically, some might say that while the parent's goal was good, the method was extreme. Others might argue that it was a necessary tough love approach. It's possible that the parent isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their son become independent. However, the action of sending an adult to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh and possibly dehumanizing, even if the intent was good.\n\nBut considering the son's age and the parent's efforts, maybe it's within their rights as a parent to set boundaries. Also, the parent gave the son a chance to come back after attending barber school, which shows they still cared. So, the answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key is whether the method was appropriate. \n\nIn the end, the parent's action led to a positive outcome, so some might say they're not wrong. Others might argue there were less harsh ways. But since the question is whether the parent is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (No).\n"
