This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The story says the son was lazy, didn't hold jobs, and the mother finally decided to cut him off by moving and sending him to the shelter. Now the son is working as a barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult, 23, so legally, the mother isn't obligated to support him anymore. Parents aren't responsible for adult children in most cases. The mother tried to encourage him to get a job and even suggested trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. The mother's actions might be seen as a last resort after years of inaction.\n\nHowever, sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic step. Some might argue that there are other ways to encourage independence without using such a harsh method. For example, cutting off financial support, setting boundaries, or requiring him to move out with a lease. The shelter might have been a shock tactic, but it's not clear if she had other options, especially if he was resistant to other methods.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's intention was to push him towards independence. The son did eventually take responsibility after the incident. So, while the method was extreme, the outcome was positive. The key points are: the son is an adult, the mother tried various approaches before this, and the action led to a positive change.\n\nBut is it right to use a homeless shelter as a means of coercion? Some might say it's too harsh and could be seen as abandoning a family member. Others might argue that when all else fails, it's a necessary step for the child's own growth. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal beliefs about parenting adult children. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could swing either way, but given the context of the son's behavior and the mother's attempts, it's a tough call. However, since the mother's intent was to help her son become independent, and the son responded positively, maybe she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
