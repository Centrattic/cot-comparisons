This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried various ways to get him to work, but he kept quitting or getting fired. Eventually, they sold the house and had to move, so they sent him to the shelter. The son then went to barber school and now lives on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent. They tried talking to him, suggesting trade schools, but he didn't take action. The parent felt it was necessary to take drastic measures when they moved. The shelter was a last resort after the house sale.\n\nBut wait, is sending a 23-year-old adult to a homeless shelter appropriate? Even if the parent is a caregiver, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult and should be responsible for himself. The parent might have thought they were helping, but using a homeless shelter as a punishment might be seen as harsh. There could be alternative ways to encourage independence without such extreme measures. For example, cutting off financial support, making him move out gradually, or helping him find a job through other means.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the son didn't argue when taken to the shelter. Maybe he felt it was deserved, but does that make it right? The parent's approach might have been effective in the end, but the method could be questioned. Homeless shelters are for people in crisis and might not be the best environment for someone who needs structure to learn independence. There might be other resources like transitional housing or support programs.\n\nThe parent's justification is that they wanted the son to learn responsibility. However, using a homeless shelter could be considered emotional manipulation or abandonment. It's important to consider the psychological impact on the son. Even though the son eventually succeeded, the method could be seen as cruel or extreme. Other parents might have different strategies, but does that mean this parent is in the wrong? It's a gray area. The parent's intention was to help, but the execution might not have been the best approach.\n\nIn some contexts, parents have a responsibility to provide for their children until they're independent, but at 23, that's not always the case. The parent might have a right to set boundaries, but the method of sending them to a shelter could be seen as overstepping. The answer depends on cultural norms and legal perspectives. In many places, parents aren't legally obligated to support adult children, so they can make choices about their living situations. However, the ethical aspect is debatable. The parent might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, there could be valid criticisms about the approach.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer hinges on whether the method used was proportionate to the issue. The parent's actions led to the son becoming independent, but the process was harsh. The parent could have explored other options first. Therefore, while the intention was good, the method could be questioned, but the overall outcome was positive. The parent might not be in the wrong, so the answer would be B.\n"
