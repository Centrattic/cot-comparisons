This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The scenario is that the son was 23, had a history of not holding jobs, and the mother eventually sent him to the shelter after selling the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother tried to convince her son to get a job or go to trade school for years. He had some jobs but quit them. The mother felt she had to take drastic action. She sold her house and moved, then sent him to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and now lives on his own.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, using a homeless shelter as a last resort might be harsh. It's a public resource for people in real need, and using it this way could be seen as taking advantage of the system. Also, the son is an adult, so maybe the mother overstepped by intervening so forcefully. On the other hand, the mother did push him to get a job, gave him chances, and after he failed repeatedly, she had to take action. The outcome was positive: he's now working and independent.\n\nBut the key question is whether sending him to a shelter was the right approach. Are there other ways? Maybe she could have set stricter boundaries without involving the shelter, like cutting off financial support or making him find his own place. However, the mother's intention was to force him to become self-sufficient. The result was positive, so some might argue the method was effective even if it was extreme. Others might say it's unethical to use a shelter for that purpose, as it's meant for people without any support.\n\nAlso, from a legal standpoint, even though the son is an adult, the mother might have a right to intervene if he's still dependent. But the shelter's resources are for those in true need. So maybe the mother's action was misguided in terms of using the shelter, but her intent was to help her son. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parenting and adult children. In the end, the son did improve, but the method might not be advisable. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" the answer could be B (No) because the mother's actions, while extreme, were aimed at helping her son become independent, and the outcome was positive.\n"
