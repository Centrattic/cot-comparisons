This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mom is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm. First, I need to consider the context. The son was 23, which is an adult, so legally he's responsible for himself. But he's been struggling with finding work and staying employed. The mom tried to encourage him to go to trade school, which he didn't take seriously. Then she sold the house and set a deadline, but he didn't change his ways. Finally, she sent him to the shelter to force independence.\n\nNow, I need to think about the ethics here. On one hand, the mom is trying to protect her son's future. She's pushing him to become self-sufficient because she knows he's not doing it on his own. Sending him to a shelter might be a harsh method, but maybe she felt it was necessary after exhausting other options. On the other hand, using a homeless shelter could be seen as overly harsh, especially if there were other alternatives like temporary housing or support programs. But she mentioned that the shelter had limited beds and she had to wait for an opening, which might indicate that options were scarce.\n\nAlso, the son ended up enrolling in barber school and became self-sufficient, which seems like a positive outcome. The mom's actions led to his success. However, some might argue that there are other ways to encourage independence without subjecting someone to homelessness, even temporarily. But the key point is that the son was an adult, so the mom isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for setting boundaries. It's a tough situation where the parent had to make a hard decision to help her child grow. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the mom isn't in the wrong. She took a drastic measure but with the intention of helping her son become responsible. The fact that he turned his life around shows that her method, while harsh, was effective. However, there's always room to consider if there were other approaches, but given the info, she did what she thought was best under the circumstances.\n"
