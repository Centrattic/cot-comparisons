This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's story is that their son was 23, didn't hold a job, was irresponsible, and after selling the house, they sent him to a shelter to force him to become independent. The parent later allowed him to come back after he went to barber school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, once a child is 18, they are legally adults, so parents aren't obligated to support them. However, the approach taken here is extreme. Sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, even if the parent has the right to cut off support. \n\nNext, the parent's intention was to push the son to become self-sufficient. The son did eventually get a job, so maybe the method worked. But the means\u2014using a homeless shelter\u2014could be questioned. Are there other, less extreme options? For example, setting boundaries like requiring the son to leave the house and find his own place, providing support conditionally on him getting a job, or seeking help from community resources instead of a shelter.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they never heard of other parents doing this. It might be that there are alternative methods that are more common, like mediation or setting strict rules. However, in this case, the son wasn't responding to other methods. The parent's actions could be seen as a last resort, but it's still a harsh one.\n\nEthically, while the parent's goal was to help their son become independent, the method might be considered inhumane or overly punitive. The shelter could have been a traumatic experience, and there's a risk that it could have had negative psychological effects. However, the parent did follow through on the threat without physical harm and allowed the son to return once he made positive changes.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the parent might not be \"in the wrong\" if they were trying to enforce independence, but the approach could be debated. The answer hinges on whether the method was proportionate to the problem. Since the son eventually turned his life around, maybe the end justified the means in this case. But it's a close call. The parent could be seen as doing what was necessary for their son's growth, but others might argue that there were less drastic ways to handle it.\n"
