This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the mother is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son was described as lazy, not holding jobs, and the mother felt guilty but had to take drastic action. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age. At 23, the son is an adult. Parents aren't legally obligated to support their adult children. So the mother's actions might be seen as within her rights. But emotionally, it's tough. She did give him warnings and tried other methods, like suggesting trade schools. When he didn't change, she decided to move away and then sent him to the shelter.\n\nSome might argue that sending an adult to a homeless shelter is harsh. But others might say it's necessary for his growth. The key points are that the son was given multiple chances, and the mother tried to help by suggesting barber school. The outcome was positive; he became a barber and now lives independently. \n\nThe mother's intention was to push him to become self-sufficient. While the method was extreme, it worked. However, using a homeless shelter might be seen as too drastic. Maybe there were other options like letting him stay in a transitional home or finding a halfway house. But the mother didn't mention those. Also, she did check for available spots and waited until there was an opening, which shows some consideration for his immediate needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, as an adult, the son is responsible for his own actions. The mother's actions forced him to take accountability. Some might say the mother was right to set boundaries, even if it was harsh. Others might think there's a better way, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't force him into the shelter against his will (he didn't fight her), and he eventually succeeded, it's possible she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she acted to encourage independence, even if the method was tough. However, the approach could be debated, but it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
