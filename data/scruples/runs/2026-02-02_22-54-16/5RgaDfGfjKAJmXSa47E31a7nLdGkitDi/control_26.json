This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding down jobs, partying, and not contributing. The parent felt they had to take this drastic step to make him independent. Now the son is a barber and living on his own, but the parent is questioning if this was the right approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so parents aren't legally obligated to support him. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. But maybe the parent felt they had no other options. The parent had given warnings and tried to encourage the son to get a trade, but the son wasn't cooperative.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. Was this action justified? The parent's intention was to force independence. The son ended up taking the barber school route and became self-sufficient. So the outcome was positive. But the method was extreme. Could there have been a better way? Like setting boundaries without using the shelter, maybe giving him an ultimatum to leave the house but with some support? However, the parent might not have had the resources or patience for that.\n\nOther parents might handle it by cutting off financial support, setting strict conditions for staying, or encouraging the adult child to find their own place. But the parent here chose a more direct approach. The key points are whether the action was necessary and if there were other options. The parent did mention trying to get him into trade school, but the son didn't follow through. The shelter was a last resort after the house sold.\n\nAlso, the parent had sold the house and moved, which is a significant step. The shelter was a temporary measure, and the son eventually took responsibility. So maybe the parent's actions, while harsh, led to a positive outcome. The parent might be in the right because they were trying to push the son into independence. However, some might argue that sending an adult to a homeless shelter is excessive, even if it worked out. There's also the question of whether the parent had other resources or support systems to consider.\n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on whether the parent's intent was to help the son become self-reliant, which it seems was the case. The parent's actions were tough love, but the result was positive. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B for No.\n"
