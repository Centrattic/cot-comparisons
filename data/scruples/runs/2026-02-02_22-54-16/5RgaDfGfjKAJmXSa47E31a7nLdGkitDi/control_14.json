This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the son's behavior. He was 23, which is an adult, and had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and avoiding responsibility. The mother tried to encourage him through trade school suggestions, but he didn't commit. She even sold her house and moved away, giving him a deadline. When he didn't change his ways, she took drastic action.\n\nNow, the key point here is that the son is an adult. Parents aren't legally obligated to support their adult children. The mother's actions might be harsh, but she's trying to push him to become independent. The shelter was a last resort after she felt she had tried all other options. She did check for availability, which shows some effort to ensure he had a place.\n\nHowever, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh and potentially traumatic. There might be alternative methods, like cutting off financial support, encouraging job training, or involving other family members. But the mother's goal was to force responsibility, and it worked\u2014her son eventually got into barber school and is now self-sufficient.\n\nThe debate here is between the mother's right to set boundaries for her adult child versus the potential harm of the method used. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't in the wrong for enforcing independence, even if the method is extreme. The outcome was positive, which might justify her actions in some eyes. But others might argue that there could have been less severe ways to push him towards responsibility.\n\nIn the end, the mother's actions, while extreme, are aimed at helping her son become independent, which is a common parental goal. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't in the wrong for taking such a step to force him to take responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
