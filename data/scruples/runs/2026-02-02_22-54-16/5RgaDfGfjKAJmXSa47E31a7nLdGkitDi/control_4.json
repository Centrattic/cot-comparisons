This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried to encourage the son to get a trade, but he kept quitting jobs and not taking responsibility. The parent eventually sold their house and moved, then sent the son to the shelter. After that, the son went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They've been trying to help their son become independent, but he's not responding. The parent might feel that they can't support him forever and are trying to force him to take responsibility. The shelter was a last resort to push him into self-sufficiency. The parent did give him a chance to return under the condition of attending barber school, which worked out.\n\nOn the other hand, sending a child to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. Even though the son is an adult, the parent might be overstepping. Adult children are supposed to make their own decisions, even if they're not making good ones. The parent could have tried other methods first, like cutting off financial support, setting clear boundaries without using the shelter, or encouraging him through other means. The action might be seen as harsh and potentially harmful, even if the intention was good.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they never heard of other parents doing this, which suggests it's an unusual approach. While the end result was positive (son became a barber), the method could be questioned. The parent might have legal or ethical obligations to provide for their child if he's a dependent, but once the child is 18, that's not necessarily the case. However, the parent's action could be seen as an act of desperation rather than the right approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent wanted to help their son become independent, which is a valid goal. But the method chosen was extreme. Alternatives might have included legal emancipation, stricter financial boundaries, or working with social services. Sending him to a shelter might have been traumatic and could have been avoided with different strategies. However, considering the parent's efforts over time and the eventual success, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But I'm leaning towards the parent being in the wrong because the action was harsh and there might have been other ways to handle it without using a homeless shelter.\n"
