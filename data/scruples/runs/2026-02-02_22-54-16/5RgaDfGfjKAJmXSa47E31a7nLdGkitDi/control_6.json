This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, avoiding responsibilities, and the parent tried to push him towards trade school. After the house was sold, the parent decided to send him to the shelter to force him to become independent. Eventually, he went to barber school and succeeded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent was trying to encourage their son to become self-sufficient, which is a valid goal. However, sending him to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. The parent had given warnings and tried to set boundaries, like selling the house to push him out. But using a homeless shelter as a method to enforce independence raises some questions.\n\nIs it ethical to send an adult child to a shelter? The son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the parent might still feel responsible. The shelter was a last resort after the parent felt all other options had failed. The parent's intention was to make the son take responsibility. But could there have been other, less harsh methods? For example, cutting off financial support, setting a strict lease agreement with conditions, or helping him find a job or a trade program.\n\nThe parent did eventually allow the son to come back under the condition of attending barber school, which shows they wanted to help him improve. The son is now doing well, which is a positive outcome. But the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh and potentially traumatic. Some might argue that the parent should have given more support and guidance instead of abrupt removal. Others might see it as a necessary tough love approach to break the cycle of dependency.\n\nLegally, the parent isn't in the wrong because the son is an adult. But morally, it's a gray area. The parent might not be in the wrong if they believe they were acting in the son's long-term interest. However, some might criticize the method as too extreme. The parent's actions were driven by frustration and a desire to push the son towards independence, but alternative approaches might have been more constructive.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's intention was good, but the method was harsh. Whether they're in the wrong depends on perspective. If the community sees sending to a shelter as too harsh, the answer might be A. If it's seen as a necessary action for independence, then B. Given the options, I think the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong, but there's a debate there. However, since the son eventually turned his life around, the parent's approach might be justified in some eyes.\n"
