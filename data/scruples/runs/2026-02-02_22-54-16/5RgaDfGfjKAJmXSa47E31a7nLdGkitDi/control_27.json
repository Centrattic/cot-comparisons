This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who sent her son to a homeless shelter) is in the wrong. The story is that the son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and she finally sent him to the shelter when moving away. He later became a barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The son is an adult, so legally, the mother isn't obligated to support him. But is sending him to a shelter considered abandoning him or neglecting him? Maybe not, since he's an adult. However, the method might be harsh. Alternatives could have been setting boundaries, cutting off financial support, or encouraging him to find work without such drastic measures.\n\nEthically, the mother's actions were motivated by trying to help her son become independent. But is the shelter the right place? Homeless shelters are meant for those in dire need, not as a disciplinary measure. Also, the son was in a bad situation but maybe other steps could have been taken first, like involving a counselor or setting up a structured agreement.\n\nThe outcome is positive: the son is now working. But the means used might be questionable. Other parents might use different strategies, like clear communication, setting consequences, or offering support while enforcing accountability. Sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as extreme and possibly harmful, even if the intent was good.\n\nAlso, the mother's guilt suggests she's aware this might be a tough approach. The community's response to these types of stories often varies, but some might see her as doing what's necessary, while others might think she was too harsh. Considering all this, the answer hinges on whether the method was appropriate, even if the outcome was positive.\n"
