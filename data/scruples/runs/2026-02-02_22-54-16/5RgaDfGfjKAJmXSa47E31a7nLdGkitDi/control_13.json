This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, so the mother isn't legally obligated to support him. He wasn't working, contributing, and had a history of not holding jobs. The mother tried various approaches, like suggesting trade school and setting boundaries. When she sold her house and moved, she gave him an ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and responsibility. The son is an adult, which means he should have personal responsibility. The mother's actions were a last resort after other methods failed. While sending someone to a homeless shelter is extreme, it might be justified if she felt she couldn't support him anymore and wanted him to become self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, there's a debate here. Some might argue that the mother's approach was too harsh, especially since the son didn't have a criminal record or harm others. Others might see it as a necessary step to push him towards independence. The fact that he eventually succeeded in barber school shows the method worked, but the method's severity is questionable.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, parents aren't required to support adult children. The mother isn't breaking the law. Ethically, it's more about whether the action was appropriate. There's also the emotional impact. The son didn't fight back, which might indicate he knew he was in the wrong, but the mother's guilt suggests she was conflicted.\n\nAlternative solutions could have included cutting off financial support, requiring him to work under certain conditions, or finding other resources. But the mother felt that the shelter was the only way to enforce change. \n\nIn conclusion, while the action is extreme, the mother's intent was to encourage independence. The son is now successful, which supports her decision. However, the method of using a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's setting boundaries for her adult child's responsibility.\n"
