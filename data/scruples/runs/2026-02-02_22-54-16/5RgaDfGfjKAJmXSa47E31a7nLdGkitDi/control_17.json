This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter. The situation is that the son was 23, didn't hold a job, and was irresponsible. The parent had given warnings and tried to encourage him to get a trade, but he kept failing jobs. Eventually, the parent sold their home and moved, then sent the son to the shelter to force independence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once someone is 18, they are adults, and parents aren't legally obligated to support them. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might raise ethical questions. On one hand, the parent is trying to enforce responsibility and break the cycle of dependency. On the other hand, the shelter is a place for people without homes, so using it as a disciplinary measure might not be appropriate. The parent might have other options, like a structured agreement for the son to live with them temporarily with conditions, or helping him find job training or housing assistance programs.\n\nThe parent's actions were extreme but perhaps a last resort. The son eventually got into barber school and is now independent, which shows the method worked. However, the method could have been harsh and might have long-term emotional effects. Other parents might handle it differently, like setting boundaries with support, but the parent's approach was drastic. Whether it's right or wrong depends on cultural norms, the parent's intent, and the son's response. Since the son is now doing better, maybe the parent's actions were effective, but the method of using a homeless shelter could be seen as inhumane. So, there's a balance between responsibility and compassion here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent's goal was to push independence, but some might argue A because of the harshness. Need to decide based on ethical considerations and possible alternatives.\n"
