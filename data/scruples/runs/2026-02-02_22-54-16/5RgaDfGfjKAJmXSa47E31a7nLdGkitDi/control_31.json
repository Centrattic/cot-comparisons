This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent feels guilty but thinks it was necessary.\n\nFirst, the son was 23, which is an adult. At that age, people are generally expected to be responsible for themselves. But the parent might still have a role in guiding or helping, depending on the family dynamics. The son had a history of not holding jobs and avoiding responsibility. The parent tried talking to him and pushing him towards a trade, but he didn't take it seriously. \n\nThe parent's actions were extreme\u2014sending him to a homeless shelter. That's a drastic measure. But maybe the parent felt it was the only way to force change. The son eventually went to barber school and became independent, so it worked in the end. \n\nBut was there a better way? The parent could have tried other methods like cutting off financial support, setting clear consequences, or encouraging him to seek help elsewhere. Sending someone to a homeless shelter might be considered harsh, especially if there are other options. However, the parent might have felt that was the only way to make the son realize the consequences of his actions. \n\nAlso, the parent sold the house and moved, which forced the son to leave. That was a tough decision. The parent's intention was to push the son towards independence, which is a valid parent concern. However, using a homeless shelter as a method could be seen as a last resort. The parent might not have considered other alternatives, like letting him stay in an apartment on his own with some support, but maybe that's not feasible.\n\nI need to consider if the parent's actions were justified. The parent's goal was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is a noble aim. However, the method used might be too harsh. But given the son's lack of responsibility, perhaps the parent had no other choice. The outcome was positive, so maybe the method was effective, even if controversial.\n\nIn terms of the parent's responsibility, once a child is an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. But emotionally and ethically, there's a gray area. The parent might have felt they were doing what's best, even if it was tough love. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to encourage independence and the son eventually succeeded. However, some might argue that the method was too harsh. But given the context, the parent tried other methods and this was a last resort.\n"
