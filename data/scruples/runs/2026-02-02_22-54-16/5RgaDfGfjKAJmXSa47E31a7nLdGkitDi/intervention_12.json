This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the parent who sent their adult son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent feels guilty but thinks it was necessary. The son wasn't working, wasn't taking jobs seriously, and the parent eventually decided to send him to the shelter to force independence. The son ended up going to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws. Adult children are adults, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support them. The parent could choose not to provide housing. But sending an adult to a homeless shelter might have ethical issues. The parent did call every day until a bed was available, which might be a problem because shelters have specific intake processes. Maybe the parent bypassed proper protocols, which could be an issue.\n\nEmotionally, was this the best approach? The parent's intention was to make the son self-sufficient, but using a homeless shelter might have been harsh. Other options could include giving the son an ultimatum to leave the house without the shelter part. However, the parent did give the son time to prepare and eventually allowed him to come back under certain conditions once he started barber school.\n\nThe son's behavior was irresponsible, but the parent's method might have been extreme. However, the parent isn't in the wrong legally, and they did provide a way for the son to return once he made an effort. The key here is whether the parent acted within legal bounds and if there were more appropriate methods. Since the parent wasn't forcing the shelter on the son directly but used it as a last resort, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
