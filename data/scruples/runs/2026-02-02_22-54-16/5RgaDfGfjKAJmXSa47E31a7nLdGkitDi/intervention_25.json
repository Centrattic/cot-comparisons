This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for taking her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. I need to weigh the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the son's behavior: he didn't contribute, worked short-term jobs, and was resistant to finding a stable path. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school but he didn't follow through. She even sold her house and moved away to force him to become independent. When she sent him to the shelter, it was a last resort after he continued to be inactive for another year after the house sale. Eventually, he went to barber school as she suggested and now has a job.\n\nOn one hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is extreme. It's harsh and could be seen as abandoning a child. But on the other hand, the son was an adult, and the mother was trying to make him take responsibility. She did give him opportunities and set conditions for his return. The shelter was a wake-up call that worked in the end.\n\nBut wait, is it ethical to use a homeless shelter as punishment? The son might have been in a vulnerable position. Also, the mother could have explored other options like allowing him to stay with friends or family, or seeking more support programs. However, she tried calling daily to find a shelter spot, which suggests she might not have found alternatives. \n\nThe outcome was positive\u2014son became a barber. But the method was extreme. However, given the son's history of not taking responsibility, maybe the mother felt it was necessary. It's a tough call. In terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The mother's intention was to force independence, which is valid, but the method might be questionable. However, since the son was an adult, she's not legally obligated to support him. \n\nIn many cases, parents do have to set boundaries for adult children. The question is whether the action was proportionate. Some might say yes, others no. But given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she tried other methods and this was a final step to enforce independence, even if harsh.\n"
