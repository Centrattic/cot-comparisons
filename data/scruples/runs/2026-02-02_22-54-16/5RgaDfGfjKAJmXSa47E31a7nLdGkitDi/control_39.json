This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a parent, sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, not contributing, and the parent felt it was time to make him independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. The parent tried to encourage him to get a trade, but he didn't follow through. The parent even tried to give him chances by allowing him to stay until the house was sold, but he didn't change his behavior. \n\nThe parent's actions were pretty drastic, but maybe they were the only option left. The son ended up going to barber school and now has his own job and place. So in the end, it worked out. But was sending him to a shelter the right approach? \n\nOn one hand, the parent tried other methods first\u2014talking, giving him opportunities, setting deadlines. When that didn't work, they took a firm stand. Adult children are supposed to be independent, so maybe the parent was just enforcing that. \n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is a harsh measure. It could be seen as abandoning them, even if the intention was to push them to become self-sufficient. There might be alternative steps, like cutting off financial support, setting strict conditions for staying, or involving other family members or social services. \n\nBut given the son's resistance to change and the parent's need to move on with their own life, maybe the parent felt this was necessary. The outcome was positive, so maybe the end justifies the means here. \n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. Homes are supposed to be a place of support, and using a homeless shelter as a punishment might be considered extreme. It could leave lasting emotional scars, even if the son is now successful. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The parent's intention was to help the son become independent, which is a valid goal. The method was harsh, but perhaps it was the only way given the son's apathy. Other methods might not have worked, and the parent had already given multiple chances. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent was trying to enforce independence and had already tried other avenues. But there's a valid argument that the method was too harsh. However, since the son eventually turned his life around, maybe it was justified.\n"
