This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent tried various methods to push the son towards a trade, like suggesting barber school, but the son kept quitting jobs and not taking responsibility. Eventually, the parent sold the house and sent him to a shelter, leading to the son eventually going to barber school and now being independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's actions were justified. The son was an adult, so legally, he's responsible for himself. However, the parent might have felt they were enabling the son's irresponsible behavior by letting him live at home. The shelter was a last resort after years of the son not working and the parent giving ultimatums.\n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as tough love. They wanted the son to learn responsibility, and sending him to a shelter was a drastic but effective measure. However, some might argue that the parent could have tried more constructive methods, like involving the son in the decision-making process, providing more support, or seeking counseling instead of immediate eviction.\n\nBut the parent did give the son opportunities over the years. They suggested trade schools, the son had jobs that didn't last, and the parent eventually set a firm boundary. The shelter was a final step after the house sale was imminent. The key points are that the son was an adult, the parent tried multiple approaches, and the result was the son becoming self-sufficient.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents often struggle with when to let go of control. The parent's action might be controversial, but it led to a positive outcome. The question is whether the method was too harsh. However, since the parent provided a conditional support (letting the son come back if he went to barber school), it shows a willingness to help once the son took initiative.\n\nSo, the parent's actions were a tough but effective approach. They didn't give up on the son but forced a situation where he had to take responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
