This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. The parent tried various methods to encourage him, including suggesting trade schools and eventually selling their house to move away, which forced the son to leave. The son ended up going to barber school and now works on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending a minor to a shelter would be illegal, but here the son is an adult. So legally, the parent isn't in the wrong there.\n\nNext, the ethical perspective. The parent tried multiple approaches to help the son become independent\u2014discussing trade schools, allowing him to work temporary jobs, and even moving away to push him out. The shelter was a last resort after years of the son not taking responsibility. The parent's goal was to force the son into self-sufficiency, which worked as the son eventually found a trade. \n\nSome might argue that the parent was too harsh, but given the son's resistance to all other methods, the shelter might have been necessary. Also, the parent did offer support after the fact by allowing the son to come back under the condition he learns barbering. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The parent felt it was necessary for the son's growth, even though it was hard. The son, while initially resistant, didn't fight the decision, indicating he might have realized the need for change.\n\nComparing to other methods: some parents might disown or cut off completely, but this approach actually led to the son improving. The parent provided a specific path (barber school) for the son to return, which shows they still cared but wanted accountability.\n\nIn summary, the parent's actions, while extreme, were aimed at fostering independence in an adult son who wasn't taking responsibility. The outcome was positive, so ethically, the parent's approach might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
