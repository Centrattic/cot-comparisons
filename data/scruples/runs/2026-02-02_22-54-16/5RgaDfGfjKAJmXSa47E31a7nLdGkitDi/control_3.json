This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The parent sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding down jobs, being uncooperative, and the parent felt they had to take drastic measures to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the son. At 23, he's an adult, so legally, the parent isn't obligated to support him. But there's a moral and emotional aspect here. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job and go to trade school but he didn't take it seriously. The parent's actions were a last resort after selling the house to move away, giving him a year to find his own way.\n\nThe parent's intention was to force independence, which is a valid concern. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. Homelessness is a serious issue, and using it as a punitive measure might be seen as harsh. The son eventually went to barber school and is now self-sufficient, which is a positive outcome, but the method used to get there is questionable.\n\nI should also think about alternatives. Were there other options the parent could have explored before resorting to a shelter? Maybe setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support gradually, or encouraging other forms of assistance. But the parent might have felt that without such drastic action, the son would never take responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the parent's guilt is mentioned, indicating they're aware this is a tough choice. However, the key point is whether the action was wrong. The parent did make the son leave, which is within their rights, but the method involved a homeless shelter, which might be seen as unnecessarily harsh. \n\nIn some cultures or contexts, this might be more accepted, but generally, sending someone to a shelter can be seen as an extreme measure. It's important to consider the son's well-being. While the parent wanted to push him to independence, the approach could have been more supportive rather than punitive. However, the fact that the son is now doing well might mitigate some of the criticism.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The parent acted out of a desire to help their son grow, but the method might be considered too harsh. So, the answer leans towards A (the parent is in the wrong) because using a homeless shelter as a tactic is extreme and could be seen as neglectful or cruel, even if the outcome was positive. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the parent's intent was to enforce responsibility and the son needed that push. However, most people might view sending an adult to a homeless shelter as going too far, making the parent at fault for not finding a less extreme solution.\n"
