This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent set a deadline, the son didn't meet expectations, and then the parent followed through by sending him to the shelter. The son eventually got his act together and became a barber, living on his own now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so legally the parent isn't obligated to support him. However, in some places, there might be laws about abandoning someone, but since the parent gave him a chance to move out before selling the house, maybe that's covered. \n\nNext, ethical considerations. The parent tried to guide the son for years, offered trade school suggestions, and even gave him the opportunity to move with them. When that didn't work, the parent set a clear boundary. Sending him to a shelter might be seen as a harsh but effective measure to push him toward independence. However, using a homeless shelter could be controversial because shelters are for people in immediate need, and the son had time to prepare. \n\nAnother angle: mental health. The son's behavior suggests possible underlying issues like depression or lack of motivation. The parent might not have addressed these issues, instead using a harsh punishment. Was there a better way, like counseling or more support? But the parent might not have access to those resources or the son might have refused help.\n\nSocial norms play a role too. Some might see the parent's action as tough love, necessary to teach responsibility. Others might argue that the parent should have explored other options first, like allowing the son to stay until he found a job, with stricter conditions. However, the parent had already given multiple chances and was moving away, making it a last resort.\n\nThe outcome is positive: the son became a barber and is independent. That might tip the scales in the parent's favor, showing the method worked. But the means\u2014using a homeless shelter\u2014could be seen as extreme. However, since he agreed to go to barber school as a condition to come back, maybe it was a calculated move.\n\nLegal and ethical boundaries: The parent isn't forcing the son to stay; they're removing themselves from enabling the behavior. The shelter was a temporary measure to push independence. The parent isn't cutting off all support entirely, as they allowed the son to return under certain conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method is harsh, the parent's actions seem motivated by a desire to help their son become independent. Given the context of multiple failed attempts and the positive outcome, the parent might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
