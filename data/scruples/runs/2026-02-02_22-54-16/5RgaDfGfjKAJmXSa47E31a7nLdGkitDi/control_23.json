This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried various things like encouraging him to go to trade school, he worked a few short-term jobs, and then the parent decided to move away and send him to the shelter. Eventually, the son went to barber school and is now on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted their son to become independent and stop being idle. The parent tried talking to him, but he wasn't responding. The shelter was a last resort after other methods failed. The parent did this to push the son to take responsibility. \n\nBut on the other hand, using a homeless shelter might have been an extreme measure. Adult children have the right to make their own choices, even if those choices are poor. The parent could have other options, like cutting financial support, setting clear boundaries, or encouraging him to find his own housing without resorting to a shelter. Sending him to a shelter might have been traumatic and unnecessary, even if the parent's goal was to help.\n\nThe son eventually did improve after going to barber school, so maybe the parent's actions had a positive outcome. However, the method might not have been the most appropriate. The parent's guilt suggests they think it was harsh. There's no indication the son had mental health issues or was incapable of working, just a lack of motivation. \n\nOther parents might handle it by setting strict boundaries without such extreme measures. For example, requiring the son to leave once a certain age or not providing financial support until he finds a job. The homeless shelter might not be the standard approach, but it's possible that in some cases, it's seen as a way to enforce accountability. However, it's a bit of a heavy-handed tactic that could be seen as overstepping as a parent's role, especially when the son is an adult. \n\nSo, the parent's actions might be considered wrong because they used a drastic method that could be seen as inhumane, even if the intention was good. The key is whether it was a necessary step. Since the son ended up turning his life around without needing the shelter, maybe the parent could have found a less severe way. But without knowing the full context, it's hard. However, the parent's own guilt and the fact that they're asking if they were in the wrong suggests it's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics, but generally, using a homeless shelter as a punishment might not be the best approach. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for the method, even if the outcome was positive.\n"
