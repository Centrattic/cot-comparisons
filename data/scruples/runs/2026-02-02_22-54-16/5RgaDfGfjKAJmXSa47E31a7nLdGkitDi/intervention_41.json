This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the mother was wrong in sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, so the mother isn't obligated to support him financially or otherwise. He's been unemployed for a long time, not taking jobs seriously, and despite her efforts to guide him towards trade school, he didn't follow through. The mother eventually sold her house and moved, which seems like a significant step to push him out. \n\nNow, sending someone to a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. But she did it to force him to become independent. The son ended up going to barber school and is now living on his own. That shows the action had a positive outcome. \n\nBut is it right? Some might argue that it's harsh, but others might say that as a parent, she did what was necessary for his growth. The key here is the son's age. At 23, he's an adult, so the mother's actions could be seen as a last resort after other methods failed. \n\nHowever, using a homeless shelter as a means to push him out might be seen as extreme. There could be other options, like setting firm boundaries without resorting to institutionalization. But given the circumstances, and the fact that he eventually turned his life around, maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the mother's intention was to help her son become self-sufficient, even if the method was extreme. Since the son is now independent, it might be seen as a success. But I'm not sure if sending someone to a shelter is the right approach, even if it works. There might be better ways, but the mother might not have seen them at the time. \n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards the mother not being in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
