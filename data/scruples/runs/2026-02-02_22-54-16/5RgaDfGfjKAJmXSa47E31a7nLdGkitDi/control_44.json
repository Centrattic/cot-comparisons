This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. Hmm, first, I need to understand the situation. The son wasn't working, was lazy, and the parent felt guilty but finally decided to send him to a shelter to make him independent.\n\nThe parent tried to push him into a trade school, but he didn't take it seriously. He worked briefly but quit or got fired. Then the parent sold the house and moved, leaving the son behind. When the son begged to come back, he agreed to go to barber school and now he's living on his own.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent did the right thing. On one hand, the parent might have felt they were doing what was necessary for the son's growth. Adult children need to become independent, and sometimes tough love is required. But on the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter is extreme. It could be traumatic for the son, even if he eventually turned his life around. Are there other ways to handle this? Maybe giving him an ultimatum to move out gradually or setting strict conditions for support.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions they never heard of others doing this. That might indicate that it's an extreme measure. Maybe there's a better approach that still enforces responsibility without such harsh actions. However, the son did end up improving his life, so the outcome was positive. But was the method appropriate? The parent might have crossed a line by using a homeless shelter, which is a public resource meant for those in dire need, not as a punishment. It could be seen as using the system in a way it's not intended. \n\nBut then again, the parent's intention was to force independence. It's a tough balance between being a supportive parent and enforcing accountability. The answer might depend on cultural values or personal beliefs about parenting. Some might say any method that leads to the child's success is justified, while others might argue that the method was too harsh. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's actions were extreme but with the intention of helping. The son's positive change supports the effectiveness, but the method used might not be the right approach. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure. But others might defend it as necessary tough love. Hmm, I need to decide between A or B. The parent's actions were harsh, but the outcome was good. However, the method of using a homeless shelter as a last resort might not be appropriate. So maybe AITA is yes, they are in the wrong for the method, even if the intention was good. So answer A.\n"
