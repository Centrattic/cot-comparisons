This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the parent who sent their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent felt guilty but did it to push the son to become independent. The son was 23, didn't hold jobs, and the parent tried trade school suggestions. When the parent moved, they sent him to the shelter, and later the son became a barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. They wanted to force independence. The son wasn't helping, so maybe the parent felt it was necessary. But using a homeless shelter seems harsh. Are there other options? Like cutting off financial support, letting him stay in a different way, or seeking other help?\n\nAlso, the son did eventually get a job after, so maybe it worked. But was sending him to a shelter the right approach? Some might say it's too extreme, others might think it's a wake-up call. The parent might have other responsibilities or reasons for moving. The son's age is 23, adult, so maybe the parent had the right to set boundaries.\n\nBut is a homeless shelter an appropriate place for an adult who's just lazy? Or is it a last resort? The parent tried to help with trade school suggestions but the son didn't take it. The parent might have felt they had no other choice. However, the method could be questionable. Maybe the parent should have involved other resources first, like job training programs, or counseling.\n\nAlso, the parent's guilt suggests they're conflicted. So, is the action wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, the parent isn't obligated to support an adult child, but morally? It's situational. Some might argue that sending to a shelter is too harsh, while others think it's necessary to force responsibility.\n\nIn the end, the son turned his life around, so maybe the outcome justifies the means. But the method is what's under scrutiny. The parent might be in the right because they tried to push independence, but the method is debatable. So the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with reservations about the approach.\n"
