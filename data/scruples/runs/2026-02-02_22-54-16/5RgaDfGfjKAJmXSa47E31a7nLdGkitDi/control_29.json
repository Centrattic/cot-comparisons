This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer A or B, so I need to evaluate the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's son is 23 and hasn't been able to hold a job for a long time. He's been described as someone who wants to lay around, play video games, and not contribute. The mother tried to push him towards a trade school, but he didn't follow through. He did bartend for a while, but that job ended when the bar closed. He had other short-term jobs that didn't last. The mother eventually decided to sell the house and move, and when the house sold, she took him to a homeless shelter.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's intent to make her son become independent. She felt guilty about sending him to the shelter but thought it was necessary. The outcome was that he went to barber school and is now living on his own. The question is whether she was wrong to use the shelter as a method.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, can a parent force an adult child into a shelter? In many places, once someone is an adult, parents can't make them do anything against their will, but taking them to a shelter might be within their rights if the shelter allows it. Ethically, it's about whether the method was appropriate. The mother wanted to push him to independence, and while extreme, it did work. However, sending an adult to a shelter could be seen as harsh, especially if there were other options. But the mother tried other approaches and ran out of options. The shelter beds were limited, so maybe she did her due diligence.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the son's reaction. He didn't argue, so maybe he realized he needed to change. The result is positive: he's now working. So, from a result-based perspective, it worked. But was the means justified? Some might say yes, as it was a last resort after other methods failed. Others might argue that there were less harsh ways to encourage independence.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action was necessary and proportionate. Since the mother tried to encourage trade school, he didn't follow through, and after moving out, she gave him a chance to come back under conditions. The shelter was a last resort. Given that, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. However, some might argue that the shelter was too extreme. But considering the circumstances, it's a common dilemma with adult children not taking steps to be independent. The fact that it led to positive change could support her decision.\n"
