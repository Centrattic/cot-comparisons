This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter when he wouldn't get a job. The parent is the one who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The parent feels guilty but did this because they wanted their son to become independent. The son was 23, not working consistently, and the parent had given multiple chances. The parent sold the house and moved away, then sent the son to a shelter as a last resort. The son ended up going to barber school and is now self-sufficient.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh. Even if the son needed a lesson, is a homeless shelter the appropriate place? Are there other ways to encourage independence without using such an extreme measure? Also, the parent might have legal or moral responsibilities since their son is an adult, but they might still be dependent on the parent.\n\nBut then again, the parent did set boundaries and the son didn't change until forced. The parent's action forced him to take responsibility. The outcome was positive because the son is now working. However, the method used was extreme. Other parents might handle it differently, maybe by cutting off financial support or moving out, but not using a homeless shelter. There's also the question of the parent's intention\u2014was it to help the son or to punish him? If it's a shelter, maybe it's considered a harsh punishment rather than a constructive step.\n\nAlso, homeless shelters are for people who are homeless, not for disciplinary actions. The parent might be using a system meant for the homeless to teach responsibility, which isn't fair to others who actually need the shelter. Plus, if the son was capable of moving out and finding work, maybe a different approach would have been better, like setting a deadline to move out with support but without using the shelter as a tactic.\n\nSo, the parent's action was effective in the end, but the method may be unethical or inappropriate. The answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because using a homeless shelter as a punishment is too extreme and may not be considered a responsible way to handle an adult child's lack of independence. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the parent's intention was purely to help and the result was positive. But I think the consensus would lean towards A because the method is harsh and not a standard approach. Other ways might include setting boundaries without using a shelter, such as cutting off financial support and encouraging him to live independently.\n"
