This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. Hmm. The parent's intention was to make the son become independent. The son was 23, which is an adult, and had been lazy, not keeping jobs, and not contributing. The parent tried to encourage him to go to trade school but he didn't follow through. Eventually, the parent sold the house and moved away, and when the son didn't move out, they sent him to a shelter.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parent's actions and the son's age. The parent is trying to enforce independence, which is a common concern for parents of adult children. But using a homeless shelter as a method seems extreme. Homeless shelters are meant for people without housing, not as a disciplinary measure. Even though the son was an adult, the parent might have overstepped by using the shelter system that way. Also, the son was able to later get into barber school and become independent, which shows that there was potential for a different approach. Maybe the parent could have set other conditions or provided support instead of cutting off completely. Sending someone to a shelter can be traumatic and might not be the best approach for behavioral change. So, while the parent had good intentions, the method used might be considered wrong because it's harsh and not the standard way to handle such situations. Other parents might use different strategies like setting strict boundaries without involving homeless shelters. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method was too extreme and possibly inappropriate.\n"
