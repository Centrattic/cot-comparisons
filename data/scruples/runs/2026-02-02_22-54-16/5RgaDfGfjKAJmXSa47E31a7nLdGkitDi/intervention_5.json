This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried various methods to encourage the son to get a job, like suggesting trade schools and pushing for a skill. The son had a history of short-term jobs and not contributing. The parent eventually sold the house, moved away, and when the son didn't change, they sent him to a shelter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, the parent might have a moral responsibility if they've been providing for him. The parent didn't force him to stay, but using a homeless shelter as a last resort could be seen as harsh, even if the intention was to push him to change. \n\nThe parent also mentions that the shelter had limited spots and they had to wait for an opening. That might indicate that the shelter wasn't the first choice but a necessary step given the circumstances. The son eventually agreed to go to barber school and is now successful, which shows the method worked in the end. \n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe setting up a structured plan with consequences, like requiring the son to leave if he didn't find a job within a certain time, or allowing him to live at home with specific conditions. However, the parent did try to talk to him and set boundaries, like moving away and selling the house as a reminder. \n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as extreme, but the outcome was positive. The question is whether the means justified the end. The parent's intention was to help the son become independent, which is a valid goal. The harsh method might be controversial, but it wasn't abusive or illegal. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people might agree that pushing an adult child to become independent is right, but using a homeless shelter might be seen as too drastic. However, the parent did reach out to the shelter in a responsible way, ensuring a bed was available. The son's lack of resistance also suggests he might have realized the consequences of his actions. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's actions, while harsh, might not be in the wrong because they acted out of a desire to help their son and set clear boundaries. The son's subsequent success also shows that the approach, though extreme, was effective. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
