This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The author tried various methods to encourage their son to become independent, including trade school suggestions, but he kept quitting jobs. Finally, they sold the house, moved away, and when the son didn't make plans, they sent him to the shelter.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult and should be responsible for his own decisions. The parent tried to support him by pushing for trade school and a career. But the son didn't take it seriously, had a series of short-term jobs, and didn't contribute much. The parent's frustration likely built up over time, leading to the decision to send him to the shelter. \n\nNow, is the parent wrong? Well, the parent's intention was to force the son to become independent. The shelter situation was a harsh measure, but perhaps necessary given the son's resistance to change. However, using a homeless shelter might be extreme. Are there other options? Maybe setting up a structured living situation with conditions, like paying rent or finding a job as a requirement. But the parent felt that without this drastic action, the son would never change. \n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter, even if they agree, could be seen as punitive. The shelter is for people in real need, not as a disciplinary measure. The parent might have other options, like cutting off financial support or requiring the son to live elsewhere with certain conditions. Also, the parent later allowed the son to come back if he went to barber school, which shows they wanted to help him get back on track. \n\nConsidering the son's actions and the parent's efforts to help, the parent's decision might be seen as a last resort. While it's a tough approach, the outcome was positive\u2014the son became a barber and is living independently. So, the parent might not be in the wrong, but it's a borderline case. The key factors are the son's age, the parent's prior attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the measure in prompting change. The shelter was a shock tactic that worked, but some might argue it's too harsh. However, given the parent's perspective and the result, it's a valid approach in their eyes. So, probably the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
