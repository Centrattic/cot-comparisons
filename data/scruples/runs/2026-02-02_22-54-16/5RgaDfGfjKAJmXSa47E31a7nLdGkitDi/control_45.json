This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being unresponsive to advice, and then after the parents sold their house, the mom decided to send him to a shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now doing well. The question is whether the author (the mom) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult, so legally, the parents aren't responsible for his housing anymore. However, the method used to get him to change might be questionable. Using a homeless shelter could be seen as harsh, but maybe the parents felt it was necessary to push him to change.\n\nThe mom had given him multiple chances, like suggesting trade schools and offering support. But when he didn't take those opportunities, she decided to take drastic action. Some might argue that sending an adult child to a shelter without alternatives could be seen as cruel, but others might think it was a necessary tough love approach.\n\nAlso, the son eventually changed his behavior after being sent to the shelter, which shows that the action had the desired effect. The mom's intention was to make him self-sufficient, which is a valid concern for any parent. However, the approach could have been more supportive, like helping him find a job or trade program instead of using a shelter as a shock tactic.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact. Forcing someone into a homeless shelter might be traumatic, even if it's intended to help. But since the son did improve, maybe the method was effective. The debate here is between the means and the end result.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's rare for parents to send adult children to shelters, which the author noted. But since the son was an adult, the parents aren't obligated to provide housing. The key is whether the action was appropriate given the circumstances. Since the son was capable of working but didn't, the parents might have felt they had no other options.\n\nI should also consider if there were other steps taken. The mom did set a deadline by selling the house and gave him time to prepare. The shelter was a last resort after he didn't change his behavior. Also, after the shelter, the mom offered support once he agreed to go to barber school, showing she wanted to help once he made an effort.\n\nIn conclusion, while the action was extreme, the parents' intention was to encourage independence, and the outcome was positive. However, the method might not be the best example of support. But since the son is now successful, it's debatable whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No) because the parents acted to push their adult child towards self-sufficiency, even if the method was harsh.\n"
