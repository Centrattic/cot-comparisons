This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the mom is in the wrong for sending her son to a homeless shelter. The situation is that her son was 23, unmotivated, wouldn't get a job, and after years of trying to encourage him, she finally sent him to a shelter to force independence. Now he's a barber and living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom tried various methods: suggesting trade schools, talking to him, even selling the house to push him out. She felt guilty but thought it was necessary. The son eventually changed after being in the shelter. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say that using a homeless shelter as a last resort is extreme, but others might argue that she was trying to help him become self-sufficient. The key points are the intent and the outcome. The mom's intention was to push her son towards independence, and it worked, but the method involved a public institution meant for those in immediate need. \n\nPossible arguments for the mom being wrong: Homeless shelters are for people in crisis, not for disciplinary actions. This could be seen as using a system not intended for such purposes. Also, the emotional impact on the son might be significant. \n\nArguments for her not being wrong: She was trying to help her son become independent when he was an adult. Parents have a responsibility to eventually let go, and sometimes harsh measures are needed. The outcome was positive, so maybe the ends justified the means. \n\nAlso, cultural and personal values play a role. In some cultures, pushing adult children to become independent is expected, even if it's tough. In others, this might be seen as too harsh. \n\nI should also consider if there were other options. Maybe she could have cut off financial support, but she did sell the house to move away. The shelter was a last resort after he didn't respond to previous actions. \n\nIn the end, the son became successful, so maybe the method, though extreme, worked. But does that make it right? The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. There's no clear right or wrong. However, given that the intent was to help and the outcome was positive, many might not hold it against her. Others might argue the method was inappropriate regardless of the result. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the perspective. Since the user wants a choice between A or B, and given that the action was extreme but with good intentions and results, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
