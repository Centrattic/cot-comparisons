This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The author's son was 23, had a history of not holding jobs, and the parent felt they had to take drastic action to force him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, once a child turns 18, they are legally an adult, so parents aren't obligated to support them financially. The parent here is setting boundaries, which some might see as necessary for the son's growth. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, even if the intention is to push independence.\n\nThe son's behavior was a problem\u2014he wasn't taking responsibility, not contributing, and the parent had tried other methods like suggesting trade schools. The parent eventually moved away, cutting off support. The shelter was a last resort after other options failed. The son then eventually took up the offered condition (barber school) and became independent.\n\nBut is the method of using a homeless shelter appropriate? Some might argue that there are less extreme ways to enforce independence, like cutting off financial support without using a shelter, or seeking professional help. On the other hand, the parent might not have had other options, especially if the son was uncooperative and the shelter had limited resources. The parent's actions led to positive change, but the method is questionable.\n\nAlso, the parent's guilt suggests they're aware of the potential judgment. The community's response to such actions could vary. Some might support strict measures for adult children, others might think it's too harsh. The key points here are the intent to help the son become independent versus the method used. Even though the outcome was positive, the method involved using a homeless shelter, which is a public resource meant for those in dire need, not as a wake-up call. That could be seen as misuse of the system.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. Legally, they're not responsible anymore, but ethically, using a homeless shelter as a punishment might be crossing a line. There might be other ways to enforce independence without involving such drastic steps. The parent might be right in wanting their son to become self-sufficient, but the method could be considered wrong because it uses a system intended for those in genuine need as a tool for discipline. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method, while well-intentioned, misuses the homeless shelter and could be seen as unnecessarily harsh.\n"
