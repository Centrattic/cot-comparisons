This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wasn't getting a job. The parent tried to encourage him to get a trade, but he kept quitting jobs and not working. Eventually, the parent sold the house, moved away, and sent him to the shelter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted to force their son to become independent. The son was an adult, so the parent might feel that they're not responsible for supporting him anymore. The parent did try other methods first, like pushing him towards trade school and setting boundaries when moving. The shelter was a last resort after other attempts failed.\n\nBut wait, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is pretty drastic. The son is 23, which is an adult age. The parent might have overstepped because even if the son isn't working, he's legally an adult. The parent's actions could be seen as harsh, but maybe they were trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions. The son did eventually get a job after going to barber school, so maybe the parent's actions had a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, the method might be questionable. Homeless shelters are for people without homes, and the parent is an adult with a home. Maybe there were other options, like setting financial boundaries or making him live elsewhere but not in a shelter. The parent might be in the wrong for using such an extreme measure, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut then again, if the parent had allowed him to stay, he might have continued being dependent. The parent tried to make him self-sufficient. The answer might depend on cultural views on parenting and boundaries. In some cultures, parents might enforce strict independence, while others might prioritize less harsh methods.\n\nAlso, the parent's guilt suggests they're conflicted. They might have thought it was necessary. The key points are the son's age, the parent's attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the action. The parent's actions led to the son getting a job, so maybe it's justified. But the method is extreme. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent's intention was to help, and they used the last resort after other methods failed. The son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated, but morally, the parent tried to push him towards independence. The harshness is debatable, but given the outcome, maybe it's acceptable. So, B.\n"
