This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter. The son wasn't working, wouldn't take a trade school seriously, and the parent felt forced to take drastic measures. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, 23, so he's legally an adult. The parent tried multiple times to get him to take responsibility, including suggesting trade school. The son didn't hold jobs, kept slacking, and when the parent decided to move away, the son didn't make plans. The parent then took him to a shelter, which forced him into a situation where he had to get a job (barber school as a condition to come back). \n\nThe parent's actions were a last resort after other efforts failed. The son did eventually take responsibility and become a barber. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parent was wrong. On one hand, sending an adult child to a shelter might be seen as harsh, but the parent's intention was to push the son towards independence. The parent also offered a way back if he complied. \n\nBut are there other ways? Maybe, but the parent felt they had tried everything else. The shelter was a last resort, so maybe not in the wrong. The parent's actions led to positive change, which could justify it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the shelter is an extreme measure for an adult, even if they're not contributing. But since the son was an adult, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him, so forcing him out could be seen as necessary for his growth. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
