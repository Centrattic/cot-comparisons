This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent's son was 23, not working consistently, and the parent eventually had enough, sold the house, and sent him to a shelter. The son later got into barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once someone is an adult (18+), parents aren't legally obligated to support them. The parent here might be within their rights to set boundaries. However, taking an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. It could be seen as a last resort after years of the son not contributing and the parent giving multiple chances. The parent did offer support after the son went to barber school, which shows they wanted to help once he took initiative.\n\nOn the other hand, sending someone to a homeless shelter can be traumatic. Even though the son eventually turned his life around, the method might be harsh. Alternatives like temporary housing, financial support with conditions, or community resources could have been considered. But the parent mentions trying to talk to him repeatedly and he didn't take action. The parent's intention was to force independence, which is a valid goal, but the method's severity is debatable.\n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as justified if they tried all other options and truly believed this was necessary for the son's growth. However, others might argue that using a homeless shelter as a shock tactic could have negative psychological effects. The outcome is positive (son now has a job), but the method's morality is questionable. The parent also mentions feeling guilty, which adds complexity. It's possible they felt this was the only way, but the community might have different opinions on the right approach. So, the answer isn't straightforward, but based on the parent's intent and the son's eventual success, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But there's a valid argument either way.\n"
