This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried various ways to get him to get a job, including suggesting trade schools, and when that didn't work, decided to move away and eventually sent him to the shelter. The son then went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. Parents have the right to set boundaries, especially if the child is not contributing. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme, but if the parent is cutting off financial support, maybe it's within their rights.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the parent is being too harsh, especially if there's a history of emotional neglect or if the son had mental health issues. But the parent did try other methods first, like suggesting trade schools and giving him time to adjust. The parent also offered a condition for moving back in, which led to the son improving his life. \n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options. However, using a homeless shelter as a method might be harsh, but given that the son was an adult and the parent was removing support, it could be justified. The outcome is positive, so maybe the parent's intention was to force independence.\n\nOther factors: How did the parent handle the situation emotionally? Did the son have any other support systems? The parent mentions it was the hardest thing, showing they cared. The son eventually succeeded, so maybe it worked out. \n\nIn some cultures, parents might expect adult children to be independent, but the method here is unique. But since the parent isn't a legal guardian anymore, their decisions are their own. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to enforce independence, albeit through a tough method. The alternative could be keeping him dependent, which might be worse in the long run.\n"
