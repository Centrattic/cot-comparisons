This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The author tried various things like encouraging him to go to trade school, he had some jobs but didn't last, then finally the author sold the house and sent him to the shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now doing better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since the son is 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme, even if they're responsible for their own actions. The parent's intention was to force independence, which is a valid concern for parents wanting their kids to become self-sufficient.\n\nOn the other hand, using a homeless shelter as a punishment could be harsh. Homeless shelters are meant for people in immediate need, not as a disciplinary measure. The parent might have other options, like cutting off financial support, setting boundaries, or encouraging the son to find his own housing without using the shelter system. Also, the son didn't resist, which might indicate he saw it coming, but it's still a tough situation.\n\nThe parent's actions led to the son eventually getting a job, which is a positive outcome. But the method used could be questioned. There's a difference between setting consequences and using extreme measures. The parent might be seen as taking a drastic step that could have long-term effects on the relationship or the son's well-being. However, the parent's goal was to help the son become independent, which is a common parental desire.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while other parents might use different methods, the key is whether the parent's actions were reasonable. There's no clear consensus on what's acceptable here. Legally, the parent isn't at fault, but ethically, it's a gray area. The answer would depend on whether the parent's approach was proportionate and necessary. Since the parent did try other methods before this, but the shelter was the final step, it's a tough call. The parent's intention was to help, but the method was extreme. However, the son's eventual success might justify it in the parent's eyes. So, it's a balance between the harshness of the method and the outcome.\n"
