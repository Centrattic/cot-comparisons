This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author sent their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, being uncooperative, and the author felt they had to make a tough decision to push him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, so legally, the author isn't obligated to support him anymore. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. The author tried multiple times to encourage the son to get a job or go to trade school, but he didn't follow through. The author's frustration led to the extreme measure of sending him to a shelter. \n\nNow, the question is whether this action was wrong. Different perspectives can be taken here. On one hand, the author's intention was to force independence, which is a valid concern for a parent. The son eventually did get into barber school and is now living on his own, which shows the approach worked in the long run. \n\nOn the other hand, using a homeless shelter as a method might be seen as harsh. There's a debate about whether there were more compassionate or constructive ways to handle the situation. Some might argue that cutting off support suddenly without alternatives could be traumatic. Also, the author didn't offer ongoing support initially, which could be seen as abandonment rather than encouragement.\n\nBut considering the son's pattern of behavior and the author's attempts to guide him, maybe the shelter was a last resort. The key here is that the son is an adult, so the parent's responsibility isn't absolute. The author's actions, while extreme, were aimed at pushing the son to take responsibility. The outcome was positive, which might support the author's approach. \n\nI need to balance the harshness of the action against the intention and the result. Some people might say there's always a better way, but in the context of the son's behavior and the parent's efforts, sending him to shelter might be justified. The author didn't want to enable their son's behavior, which is a common concern among parents of adult children. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They made a difficult decision to promote independence, even though it was a tough method.\n"
