This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking her son to a homeless shelter. The situation is that the son wasn't getting a job, wasn't contributing, and she eventually sent him to a shelter when she moved. He then went to barber school and is now doing well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is 23, an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. But the parent gave him a choice to leave, and he didn't comply until forced. \n\nEthically, it's about the parent's responsibility. Some might argue that the parent tried to push him towards a trade school and bartending, which he didn't follow through. The shelter was a last resort after he continued to not take responsibility. The outcome was positive\u2014he became a barber. \n\nBut others might say that the parent should have explored other options first, like cutting off financial support gradually or encouraging him to find housing independently. Sending him to a shelter could be seen as harsh, but maybe necessary to make him take action. \n\nAlso, the parent's reasoning is that they wanted him to become self-sufficient. The son's behavior was neglecting his own responsibilities. The parent's actions, while extreme, might be justified in the context of trying to break the cycle of dependency. The fact that he succeeded after this intervention supports the parent's decision.\n\nHowever, the parent could have faced backlash for using a homeless shelter as a method. There might be more supportive ways to encourage independence. But given the son's lack of progress despite prior attempts, the parent might feel this was the only way to force change.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method was harsh, the parent's intentions were for the son's betterment, and the outcome was positive. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But some might argue A if they believe there were better alternatives. But given the information, the parent's actions led to the son's improvement, which could support B.\n"
