This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who took their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent felt guilty about it but did it because the son wasn't working, kept quitting jobs, and wouldn't take responsibility. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. At 23, the son is an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. However, forcing someone into a homeless shelter is a drastic measure. Are there other options? Like, could they have cut off financial support without sending him to the shelter? The parent mentions the son had nowhere else to go after selling the house, so maybe the shelter was a last resort to ensure he wasn't left completely stranded.\n\nThe parent's intention was to push the son to become independent. While the method is harsh, the outcome was positive\u2014the son is now working. But some might argue that sending a healthy adult to a homeless shelter is unnecessarily cruel, even if the intent was good. There might be other ways to encourage independence without such a traumatic experience, like setting up a structured move-out plan with conditions.\n\nAlso, the parent had already given the son multiple chances to get a job or go to trade school, which he ignored. The parent's actions could be seen as a form of tough love. However, the lack of alternative support systems for the son is concerning. The parent ensured he had a condition to come back (barber school), which shows they were still invested in his success.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's rare for parents to take such extreme measures. Most parents might cut off support gradually or require the adult child to find their own place first. The parent's approach was effective but might be considered too harsh by some. The question is whether the means justified the end. Since the son turned his life around, maybe it's seen as a success, but others might argue that the emotional harm could have lasting effects.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the parent's actions were extreme but possibly justified by the outcome. However, the method might not be the best approach. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B) because they acted in their son's best interest to push independence, even if the method was harsh. But there's a valid argument that there are better ways to handle it, so maybe A (yes, in the wrong). Hmm. Need to decide based on typical perspectives. In the AITA context, sometimes the parent is seen as justified if the child was clearly not doing their part and the action led to a positive outcome. So probably answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
