This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried to push him towards a trade school, but the son kept quitting jobs and not taking responsibility. Finally, the parent sold the house, moved away, and sent him to the shelter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a 23-year-old is an adult, so the parent isn't obligated to support them. But ethically, there's a line. The parent had tried to encourage their son for years, but when they finally took drastic action, was that justified?\n\nThe parent's intention was to force independence. The son is now a barber and living on his own, so maybe it worked out. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter, even for their own good, is extreme. There might have been other options, like setting strict conditions for staying at home, cutting off financial support, or encouraging him to find a job with some support.\n\nBut the parent felt it was necessary to push the son to the point of homelessness to make him change. Some might argue that it's a harsh but effective method. Others might say it's cruel and that there are less extreme ways to encourage responsibility. Also, the parent's role in supporting the son's education and then not stepping in when he failed could be part of the issue. The parent might have enabled the son's behavior by not holding him accountable earlier.\n\nThe key points are: the son is an adult, the parent tried to encourage him, the action was taken to force independence, and it led to positive change. However, the method used is questionable. The answer might depend on cultural views and personal ethics. Some would say the parent was justified in pushing for independence, others would say the method was too harsh. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I need to weigh these factors. The parent's actions were extreme but led to a positive outcome. However, using a homeless shelter might cross a line. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent is not legally responsible and the son is an adult, but some might argue it's too harsh. But in the context of parents needing to let go of adult children, this might be seen as a last resort. So the answer could be B.\n"
