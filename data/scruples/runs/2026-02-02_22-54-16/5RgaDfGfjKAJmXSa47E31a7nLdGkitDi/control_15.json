This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for taking their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son was 23, which in most contexts is considered an adult. The parent tried to encourage him to get a job and even suggested trade school, but he kept failing to hold jobs. The parent then decided to sell the house and move, and when the son didn't make plans, they sent him to a shelter.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is the legal age of adulthood. In the US, 18 is the age of majority, so at 23, the son is legally an adult. Parents aren't obligated to support their adult children financially. The parent here is trying to push the son to become self-sufficient, which is a common issue with young adults. \n\nBut sending him to a homeless shelter seems extreme. The parent could have other options, like setting up a structured support system, maybe with conditions for staying. However, the parent felt that this was necessary to force the son into independence. The son did eventually get into barber school and is now living on his own, so maybe the method worked, but was it the right approach?\n\nEthically, is it wrong to use such a harsh measure? Some might argue that the parent had the right to set boundaries, especially if they felt it was the last resort. Others might say that the parent should have explored other avenues first, like allowing the son to face natural consequences without the shock of a shelter. There's also the aspect of emotional impact\u2014sending a child to a shelter can be traumatic and might affect their relationship long-term.\n\nThe parent mentions feeling guilty, which suggests internal conflict. The key points here are the son's age, the parent's attempts to help, and the effectiveness of the action. While the parent's intention was to push the son towards independence, the method might be seen as overly harsh. However, given that the son was an adult and the parent was under no obligation to house him, some might argue it's not the parent's fault. But others might say there's a better way to handle it without causing such distress.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical guidelines here. Legally, the parent isn't in the wrong because they're not required to support an adult child. Ethically, it's more gray. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In many cases, parents do set ultimatums for adult children, but sending them to a shelter is rare. The parent's actions might be seen as a last resort, but the question is whether there was a better way. The fact that the son eventually succeeded might justify the method in some eyes, but the approach's harshness is questionable.\n\nSo, would the parent be in the wrong? If the answer is A, then yes, they are. If B, then no. Considering all factors, the parent's actions were extreme but perhaps not in the wrong given the son's age and the parent's attempts to help. However, the extreme measure might not be the best approach. Different people might have different opinions here. The parent might not be in the wrong, but there's room for debate. The answer might be B, but I'm not entirely sure. It's a tough call between A and B. Given that the parent is trying to enforce independence and the son is an adult, maybe B is correct.\n"
