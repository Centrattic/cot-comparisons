This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after years of him not working and not contributing. The parent's reasoning is that they wanted to force him to become independent. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. The son was an adult, 23, so legally an adult. The parent tried various methods to encourage him to get a job and find a trade. When those didn't work, they decided to cut him off entirely by moving and then sending him to a shelter. The parent's intention was to make the son self-sufficient. \n\nThe question is whether the parent's actions were wrong. On one hand, forcing an adult child into a shelter might seem harsh. However, the parent had tried other approaches without success. The son wasn't taking responsibility, and the parent felt it was necessary to push him towards independence. The outcome was positive: the son became a barber and is living independently. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and parental responsibilities. Parents often struggle with how to handle adult children who aren't contributing. The parent's actions might be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options. While the method is extreme, the intent was to help the son become self-reliant. The parent also offered a way back through barber school, which shows they still cared and wanted to support him once he took initiative. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Sending someone to a homeless shelter can be traumatic and might not be the best way to encourage independence. There could be less drastic methods, like cutting off financial support gradually or setting clear boundaries without using a shelter. However, the parent felt that selling the house and moving was already a significant step, and the shelter was the final push needed.\n\nBut since the son eventually succeeded, maybe the parent's approach worked despite being harsh. The key here is that the parent's actions led to positive change, and they didn't abandon the son entirely but provided a way back through education. \n\nIn many cases, parents do have to find their own way to handle such situations, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. The parent isn't in the wrong because they were trying to enforce responsibility in a child who wasn't responding to other methods. The answer would probably lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent's intent was constructive, even if the method was extreme.\n"
