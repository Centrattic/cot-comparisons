This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their adult son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The author felt guilty but did it to push him to change. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living independently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The son is an adult (23), so parents aren't legally obligated to support him. However, sending him to a homeless shelter is a drastic step. While the author's intention was to help him become self-sufficient, the method is harsh. Are there better alternatives? Maybe setting clear boundaries, cutting off financial support, or encouraging him to seek help through other means without using the homeless shelter.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the shelter had limited beds, implying they actively sought an opening. This might suggest the action was planned, which could be seen as manipulative. However, the outcome was positive as the son changed his behavior. The key question is whether the means justify the ends. While the author's goal was to help, using a homeless shelter might have been traumatic and could be seen as excessive. Other parents might use different strategies, so the author's approach is unconventional but not necessarily unethical. Still, the action itself is quite extreme, so there's a case for saying the author is in the wrong for the method, even if the outcome was good.\n"
