This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) did the wrong thing by taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter when he refused to get a job or take responsibility. The parent tried various ways to get the son to change his behavior over the years, including suggesting trade schools, and eventually decided to send him to the shelter as a last resort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a child is 18, they are legally adults, and the parent isn't obligated to support them. The parent here is within their rights to stop providing a home. The son's actions\u2014refusing to work, not contributing, and being unresponsive to advice\u2014suggest he's not taking responsibility for his adult life.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The parent tried multiple approaches, like encouraging trade school and even setting a deadline by selling the house. The shelter was the last option when other methods failed. The parent's goal was to force the son to become independent, which is a valid parenting strategy when all else fails. However, some might argue that sending someone to a homeless shelter is harsh and that there could be less extreme measures, like cutting off financial support or having him leave on his own terms without the threat of homelessness.\n\nBut the parent did allow the son to come back under specific conditions once he showed willingness to change (entering barber school). This shows a commitment to helping the son once he started taking responsibility. The outcome was positive; the son became a barber and is living independently now.\n\nPossible criticisms: Maybe the parent could have tried more support or resources before using the shelter, but given the son's resistance, it's understandable that the parent felt this was necessary. Also, the shelter's availability being limited complicates things, so the parent did what they could under the circumstances.\n\nIn the end, while it's a tough situation, the parent's actions seem to be in line with encouraging independence and accountability. The son's eventual success suggests the method was effective, even if extreme. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
