This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who took their son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old son who's been unemployed, avoiding responsibility, and not contributing. The parent tried to push him towards trade school but he didn't take it seriously. After selling the house, the parent sent him to a homeless shelter to force independence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intentions. They wanted to help their son become self-sufficient, which is a valid concern. However, the method used\u2014sending him to a homeless shelter\u2014might be extreme. Are there other ways they could have handled it? Maybe setting clearer boundaries or providing support while requiring accountability. But the parent did give ultimatums earlier, like selling the house if he didn't move out. The son didn't change his behavior until the shelter incident.\n\nNext, the son's age is a factor. At 23, he's an adult, so the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent's actions might be seen as a necessary push for independence, especially since the son later took barber school and became self-sufficient. However, using a homeless shelter could be harsh and potentially damaging emotionally. The parent did offer a condition for him to come back, which shows they still cared and wanted him to succeed.\n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe a structured support system with clear consequences, like cutting off financial support without using the shelter. However, the parent might have felt desperate given the son's inaction. The key here is whether the parent's approach was proportionate to the situation. While the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable. Other parents might use different strategies, like cutting off financial aid or requiring a job before moving out. The parent's guilt suggests they felt conflicted, which adds complexity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent's intention was to help, but the method was extreme. However, the son's eventual success could argue that the approach worked. Still, using a homeless shelter might not be the most constructive way. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong because of the son's age and the outcome, but the method is debatable. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent's actions led to the son's independence, even if the method was harsh.\n"
