This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their adult son to a homeless shelter. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe parent's son is 23 when this happens. He's been lazy, not holding jobs, and not contributing. The parent tried to encourage him to get a trade, like they did, but he didn't take it seriously. He worked a few jobs briefly, then quit or got fired. The parent decided to sell their house and move away, making it clear the son needed to leave. After the house was sold, they sent him to a homeless shelter. Eventually, the son went to barber school and started living on his own.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so parents aren't obligated to support him. The parent's actions were to push him to become independent. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter is drastic. It's not just cutting off financial support, but also placing them in a difficult, possibly humiliating situation. \n\nBut the parent did give him the chance to stay in their old house until it sold, which gave him a year's notice. The parent also offered the condition of attending barber school if he wanted to come back. The son eventually took that path and succeeded. \n\nNow, considering the parent's intentions: they wanted to force independence. But the method is harsh. Are there alternatives? Maybe giving him an ultimatum to find his own place or support himself without sending him to a shelter. But the parent might not have other options, like extended family to help. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. While the parent has the right to set boundaries, the method of using a homeless shelter could be seen as cruel, even if effective. On the other hand, the parent's goal was to help the son become self-sufficient, which is a valid parenting aim. \n\nSome people might argue that the shelter was a necessary shock to the system, and it worked. Others might say there's a better way without using such extreme measures. The son's response was positive, so the outcome is good, but the process is questionable. \n\nI think the parent isn't entirely wrong because they were trying to help their son become independent, but the method could be debated. However, since the son is an adult, the parent isn't legally wrong. The emotional impact on the son and the potential trauma of being sent to a shelter might be a point against the parent's approach. But overall, the parent's intention was to help, and the outcome was positive. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
