This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the parent who sent their adult son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. The parent's son wasn't working, was unproductive, and after a long period of inaction, the parent decided to send him to the shelter to force him to become independent. The son eventually went to barber school and now lives on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 23, which in many places is considered an adult. The parent tried various approaches\u2014talking to him, suggesting trade schools, even giving him the ultimatum to move out. The son didn't respond well until the parent took drastic action. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's intent to push their son towards independence and the son's eventual positive outcome. The parent felt guilty but acted out of concern for their son's future. However, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh. But considering the son's lack of motivation and the parent's attempts to help him through other means, maybe it was a necessary step.\n\nLegally, parents aren't obligated to support adult children. Emotionally, it's a tough situation. Some might argue that the parent had the right to enforce independence, while others might say there are more constructive ways. The parent did provide a condition for the son to return, which shows they still cared. The outcome was positive, so maybe the method, though extreme, worked.\n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe, but the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent acted in what they believed was the son's best interest, even if the method was harsh. Since the son turned his life around, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. The shelter was a last resort after other methods failed. \n\nI think the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong, but it's a close call. The parent's actions, while extreme, were aimed at fostering independence and the son succeeded. However, others might argue that the method was too harsh. But given the information, the parent's intent and the positive result support answer B.\n"
