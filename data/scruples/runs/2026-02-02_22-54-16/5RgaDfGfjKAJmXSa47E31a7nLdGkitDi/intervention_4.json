This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for taking their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son wasn't working, was lazy, and the parent tried to encourage him to get a trade. They even tried to set boundaries by moving away. When that didn't work, the parent sold the house and sent him to the shelter. The son eventually got a job as a barber after going to school.\n\nNow, the parent's actions seem extreme. Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter might be seen as harsh, but the parent's intention was to make the son independent. However, there are a few points to consider. \n\nFirst, the son is an adult. At 23, he's legally an adult, so the parent is not obligated to support him. But using a homeless shelter as a means to force independence might be seen as a last resort. Are there other ways? The parent mentioned they tried trade schools and jobs, but he didn't stick with them. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, while the parent's goal was to push the son to become self-sufficient, the method might be too extreme. Other parents might use different strategies like cutting off financial support, setting strict conditions, or encouraging independence without using a homeless shelter. Sending someone to a shelter could be traumatic and might not be necessary if the son was capable of finding alternative accommodations. \n\nBut the parent also tried moving away and giving ultimatums. Maybe they felt it was the only way. However, the shelter's role is to help the homeless, not as a tool for discipline. The parent might have overstepped by using the shelter as a punishment rather than a genuine help. \n\nOn the other hand, the son eventually succeeded after the intervention. So, maybe the harsh method worked. But does that justify the means? It's a gray area. The parent's actions were driven by concern for the son's future, but the method could be questioned. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sending an adult child to a homeless shelter isn't common. Other parents might use different strategies. The parent might be in the wrong for not exploring other options first, but if they felt it was the only way, maybe not. \n\nOverall, I think the parent's intention was good, but the approach was extreme. However, since the son turned his life around, maybe it's justified. But I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they were trying to help, even if the method was harsh. So answer B.\n"
