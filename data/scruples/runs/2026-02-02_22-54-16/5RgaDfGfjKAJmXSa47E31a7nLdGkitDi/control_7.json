This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the mother is in the wrong for sending her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he wouldn't get a job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The son was 23, so he's an adult. The mom tried for years to encourage him to get a job or go to trade school, but he kept failing at jobs and avoiding responsibility. The mom finally sold her house and decided to move away, not taking him with her. When the house sold, she sent him to a shelter. Eventually, he went to barber school and now works on his own.\n\nNow, the key points here: the son is an adult, so he's legally independent. The mom's actions might be seen as harsh, but she tried other methods first. However, sending an adult to a homeless shelter could be seen as emotionally manipulative or even neglectful. She was trying to force him to become independent, but the method might be questionable. \n\nSome might argue that parents have a responsibility to care for their adult children, especially if they're struggling. Others might say that the mother did what she had to do to push him to take responsibility. But the line between tough love and neglect is thin here. \n\nAlso, the mom didn't just abandon him; she set a condition (barber school) for him to come back. That shows she wanted him to improve. However, using a homeless shelter as a last resort might have been traumatic. There might be other steps she could have taken, like setting strict boundaries while he was still at home, such as charging rent or cutting off financial support without sending him to a shelter.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents don't have a legal obligation to support adult children once they're 18, but the method of cutting off support can be ethically debated. The mother's approach was extreme, and while her intention was to help him become self-sufficient, the means might be seen as harsh and potentially harmful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used was overly harsh and there might have been less extreme ways to push him towards independence without resorting to a homeless shelter.\n"
