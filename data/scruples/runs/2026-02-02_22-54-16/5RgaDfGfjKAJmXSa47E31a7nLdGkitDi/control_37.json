This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult, 23 years old. The mother is trying to get him to become independent. He's been struggling with jobs, not staying in any for long, and not contributing. The mother tried various approaches over the years, suggesting trade schools and pushing him to take responsibility. When she sells the house and moves, she gives him an ultimatum. When he doesn't change his behavior, she sends him to a homeless shelter to force him to grow up. Eventually, he goes to barber school and becomes independent.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFrom one perspective, the mother is trying to help her adult child become self-sufficient. She's taken steps, given him chances, and when he didn't respond, she took drastic measures. However, sending someone to a homeless shelter might be seen as extreme. Even though he's an adult, the mother might have been expected to provide some support while encouraging independence, rather than cutting off completely. \n\nBut on the other hand, the son is an adult, so the mother isn't legally obligated to support him. She's trying to teach him responsibility. The shelter might have been a way to show him the consequences of his actions. The fact that he eventually turned his life around could indicate that her method worked, even if it was harsh.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. It's not typical for parents to send adult children to shelters, but it's also not unheard of when it's a last resort. The key factors here are that the son was an adult, the mother had tried other methods, and the shelter was a temporary measure to push him towards independence. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother could have found other ways to support him, like helping him find a job or a trade program without using the shelter as a shock tactic. But since the son wasn't responding to other methods, the mother's actions might be seen as a necessary, if extreme, form of intervention.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and outcomes. The mother's intent was to help her son become independent, and it worked. The outcome was positive. The method was harsh, but given the son's inaction, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because she's trying to help her adult child become independent, and despite the harsh method, the outcome was positive. But I need to be cautious. Some might say that the shelter was too extreme and that there are better ways to handle it. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the son is an adult, and she's not providing ongoing support, it's a tough call. The shelter was a wake-up call that worked. So, probably B.\n"
