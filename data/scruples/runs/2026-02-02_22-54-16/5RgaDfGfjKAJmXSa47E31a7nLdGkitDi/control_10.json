This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the mother was wrong to send her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter after he refused to get a job. \n\nFirst, the son's behavior: he's 23, hasn't held a job for long, plays video games, has friends over, and ignores his mom's advice. She tried trade school, but he didn't stick with it. She sold her house and moved away, giving him a deadline to get his act together.\n\nWhen he didn't, she took him to a homeless shelter. He later went to barber school and now lives on his own. The question is if she was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In most places, once someone is an adult, parents aren't legally responsible for their care. However, the mother provided financial support for years. Sending an adult child to a shelter might be seen as a harsh but necessary step to enforce independence. \n\nBut there's the aspect of the son's mental health. Did she consider therapy or other support systems? The story doesn't mention any. Also, using a homeless shelter as a sudden shock tactic could have negative psychological effects. However, the outcome was positive: he became self-sufficient.\n\nAlternatives might include cutting off financial support without the shock of a shelter, or encouraging trade school earlier. But she did push for trade school, and he eventually went to barber school after the incident.\n\nThe key points are the son's age (adult), his refusal to take responsibility, and the mother's intent to force independence. While the method was extreme, the outcome was positive. Other parents might use different methods, but the mother's action was a last resort after years of failed attempts. So, I think the mother isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
