This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a mother who took her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. He had a history of not holding jobs, being unproductive, and she felt guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. At 23, the son is an adult. Legally, parents aren't responsible for their children's living situations once they're adults. So, if he's an adult and not a minor, the mother isn't obligated to support him. That might mean her actions are within her rights.\n\nNext, the mother's intention. She mentions that she wanted him to become independent, so she sent him to the shelter as a way to force that. She also later helped him by suggesting barber school, which he agreed to. It seems like she wanted to help him in the long run, even if the method was harsh. But was that the right approach?\n\nThe son's actions: He wasn't working consistently, was using the house as a place to stay without contributing. Maybe he was a freeloader. The mother tried to reason with him, but he didn't respond. So she took a drastic step. But is sending someone to a homeless shelter an appropriate way to handle an adult child's behavior? \n\nHomeless shelters are for people in genuine need. If the son was capable of working but choosing not to, maybe he didn't need a shelter. Other options like cutting financial support, asking him to move out, or setting clear boundaries could have been considered. However, in some cases, especially if the son was dependent, moving out might not have been feasible unless he had a place to go.\n\nThe mother felt it was necessary to make him face reality. While her intention was to help, using a homeless shelter might be extreme. It could be seen as a last resort when other measures failed. But there's a question about whether this is a compassionate approach or if it's just punitive. Other parents might set ultimatums without involving shelters, such as giving a deadline to leave or stop financial support.\n\nAlso, the son eventually did take the barber school suggestion and became independent. So the outcome was positive. But the method\u2014using a shelter\u2014might not be the best example of support. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like providing structure without the trauma of a shelter. However, the mother might not have had other resources or options, especially if she was moving and couldn't keep him in the house.\n\nAnother angle: Did the son have the means to support himself before this? If he was living off his mom without contributing, she's within her rights to stop supporting him. The shelter might have been a way to get him to start from scratch. Still, shelters are for people in dire circumstances, so this could be controversial. Some might argue it's a harsh but effective measure, others might say it's unnecessary and could have done more harm.\n\nAlso, the mother's guilt. She says it was the hardest thing she ever did, which shows she felt conflicted. But she believed it was necessary for his growth. The question is whether the method was justified. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific context of the family's relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mother's actions were extreme but perhaps not wrong if she was trying to enforce independence. However, using a homeless shelter as a solution might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the son wasn't in immediate danger of homelessness otherwise. There might be other ways to encourage independence without such a drastic step. But ultimately, she's an adult making a decision for her adult child, so there's no clear legal wrong. The moral aspect is debatable. The options given are A for yes (wrong) and B for no. Based on the information, I think the answer is B, but I need to be careful. Maybe some would say it's wrong to use a shelter like that, others might support it. The key is whether there was a better way. The user is asking if there's a better approach and if the author is in the wrong. Since the mother's intention was to help and the outcome was positive, but the method was harsh, perhaps the answer is B. But if there were other options, maybe A. However, the mother might not have had those options, and the son wasn't taking steps to change until forced. So, in this case, the answer is B.\n"
