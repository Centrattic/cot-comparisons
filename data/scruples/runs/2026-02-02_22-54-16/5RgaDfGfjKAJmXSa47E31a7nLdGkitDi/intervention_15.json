This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent's main argument is that they tried everything else, their son was unproductive, and they felt they had no choice left. They eventually sent him to the shelter to force him to become independent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son was 23, which is an adult. The parent mentions he had a history of not holding jobs, not taking responsibilities, and not heeding advice. The parent tried to encourage him to go to trade school, but he didn't follow through. After selling the house and moving, the parent decided to send him to the shelter when he continued to be idle. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the parent justified? Sending an adult child to a homeless shelter is extreme. Adult children are legally adults, so the parent isn't required to support them. However, the method of sending him to a shelter might be harsh. The parent might have other options, like cutting off financial support gradually or setting clear boundaries without involving the shelter. But in this case, the parent felt that the shelter was the only way to push the son to change. The son did eventually change and become independent, which is a positive outcome.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? Well, it's a tough call. On one hand, the parent was trying to enforce accountability. On the other, using a homeless shelter as a tactic could be seen as emotionally manipulative or even abusive. Also, homeless shelters are meant for people in immediate need, not as a punitive measure. The parent's action might have been effective in the long run, but the method was harsh. However, considering the son was an adult, the parent's responsibility isn't absolute, and they might have the right to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might view the parent as doing what was necessary, while others might think there were better ways. The key factors are the son's age, the parent's attempts to help, and the eventual positive outcome. Since the parent's intent was to push the son towards independence and the son succeeded, maybe it's not in the wrong. But the method could be questioned. The answer would likely be B (No), the parent isn't in the wrong, because they were trying to enforce responsibility on an adult child who wasn't taking care of himself, even if the approach was extreme.\n"
