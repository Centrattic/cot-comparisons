This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for sending their 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The parent tried various ways to get the son to take a trade, but he kept quitting jobs and not contributing. Eventually, the parent sold the house and sent him to the shelter. The son eventually went to barber school and is now living on his own.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. The son is 23, which is an adult. At that age, the parent isn't legally obligated to support him. The parent tried talking to him, suggesting trade school, and setting boundaries. When those didn't work, they took drastic action. But is sending an adult to a homeless shelter appropriate?\n\nSome people might argue that the parent is in the right because they tried everything else and needed to enforce consequences. Others might say that the method was too harsh, especially using a homeless shelter, which could be seen as punitive rather than supportive. There's a difference between setting boundaries and using extreme measures. Maybe there were other options, like moving out on his own terms or seeking professional help.\n\nAlso, the parent's intention was to make the son self-sufficient, which is a valid concern. However, the approach might have been too abrupt. Using a homeless shelter as a last resort could be seen as a necessary step, but it's a heavy-handed method. The son did eventually respond positively, attending barber school. So maybe the outcome justifies the means in some eyes.\n\nBut considering the emotional impact on the son, even if he wasn't surprised, being sent to a shelter could be traumatic. It's important to assess whether there were alternative solutions that could have achieved the same result without such a drastic measure. The parent might have felt justified, but others might question if it was the best approach.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, most parents don't send their adult children to shelters. It's an extreme action. However, the parent's actions were driven by a desire to help the son become independent. The key points are the son's age, the parent's prior attempts, and the effectiveness of the method. The son did eventually change, so maybe the parent's actions had the desired effect, but the method is debatable.\n"
