This was a few years ago. \n\nMy son was one of those kids who just wanted to lay around and pig out and play video games. He could never keep a job for very long. He had friends over every weekend and contributed nothing. Every time I tried to talk to him about getting a job he would say \"Oh mom\" and go to his room and shut the door.\n\nEver since he was 17 I have told him he needs to think about a trade school he wants to attend or a skill he wants to master for his future. He wasn't college material but that's ok. I learned a trade and it has been a good living for me so I was fine with him going the trade route too.\n\nHe learned bartending and only worked one bartending job for 6 months until the bar went out of business. He worked other dumb jobs for a few weeks then would quit or get fired. This went on for years.\n\nFinally I had had enough. I told him I was selling the house and moving a half hour away and he wasn't coming with me so he better make plans.\n\nHe kept lollygagging for another year while potential buyers came around as constant reminders that soon the house will be sold.\n\nThen it sold and I bought another. Immediately after it sold I called the homeless shelter and found out they only had four beds for single males and were full. I called every day until one day there was an opening. \n\nI threw my son's shit in the car and told him we are going to the shelter. He didn't argue or fight because he knew this day was coming. I think at first he didn't believe I would really do it but when it came time he wasn't surprised.\n\nAt the shelter I told him I love him but he has to learn to get on by himself now. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. But I knew if I let him live with me it would be more of the same.\n\nA few weeks later I moved into my new home. He called and begged to come live with me. I said under one condition. He go to barber school (I am a barber).\n\nHe agreed and came home and went to barber school and is now a barber and is living on his own. \n\nWas there a better way to do this than to send him to a shelter? I never heard of other parents having to resort to this. How do other's get rid of adult kids?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mother who sent her 23-year-old son to a homeless shelter because he wouldn't get a job. The son had a history of not holding jobs, avoiding responsibility, and not contributing. The mother tried other methods, like suggesting trade schools, but he didn't take them seriously. Eventually, she sold her house and moved away, and when the house sold, she sent him to the shelter. He later went to barber school and became self-sufficient.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The son is an adult, so the mother isn't legally obligated to support him. She tried various approaches before taking this drastic step. The shelter was a last resort after he didn't respond to other interventions. The outcome was positive; he eventually got his act together.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms. Some might argue that sending a child to a shelter is too harsh, even if they're an adult. Others might see it as a necessary intervention to push him to independence. The mother's intention was to help him become self-reliant, which is a common parental goal. However, the method might be seen as extreme by some. Are there alternative methods that could have worked? The mother mentions she tried talking and setting conditions, like requiring him to go to trade school if he wanted to live with her again. That seems reasonable.\n\nIs there any harm in the method? The shelter was a temporary measure, and he did eventually succeed. But if the shelter was the only option because other resources were not available, maybe that's a factor. Also, the son didn't resist, which might indicate he recognized his own issues.\n\nLegal perspective: As an adult, the son could make his own decisions, but the mother was trying to enforce consequences. There's no legal wrong here. Ethically, it's more about the approach. Some might say that using a homeless shelter as a consequence is overly harsh, while others might believe it's a necessary shock to reality.\n\nCommunity responses on AITA threads often vary. Some commenters support strict measures for adult children who aren't contributing, while others think there's a better way. The key is whether the mother's actions were proportionate. She had tried other methods, and the outcome was positive, which might sway opinions in her favor.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother's actions, while extreme, were a last resort to encourage her son's independence. Since he became self-sufficient afterward, it might not be considered wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no oversight.\n"
