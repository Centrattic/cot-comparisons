We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for 3 years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, and she's always been insecure about her chest. The author has been with bigger girls before and prefers a larger chest. When asked by the girlfriend, he was honest about not being attracted to her chest size and that he prefers bigger ones. He also mentioned he likes her to face away during sex. She felt hurt and accused him of lying because he didn't bring it up before. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are honesty in a relationship, communication, and how preferences affect a partner's self-esteem. The author was honest, which is generally a good thing, but maybe the timing or the way he expressed it was an issue. The girlfriend had been trying on lingerie and feeling insecure, so bringing up the chest size in that context might have been a sensitive moment. Even though the author was truthful, perhaps he should have considered her feelings more and approached the topic with more care and empathy. Also, not addressing her insecurities proactively might be part of the problem. Maybe he didn't validate her feelings enough or didn't communicate his preferences in a way that reassures her she's still attractive in other ways. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate preferences without making the partner feel inadequate. The author's preference is his own, but how he conveyed it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she was already insecure. The author could have been more supportive, maybe by acknowledging her efforts and affirming her attractiveness overall before bringing up his personal preference. So, even though he was honest, the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his honesty wasn't delivered in a way that was kind or considerate of her feelings, leading to hurt and a lie accusation. But I need to be sure. Let me check again. The author didn't lie, he was honest. But maybe the problem is that he didn't address her insecurities earlier or support her, instead of just stating his preference. So the wrong part is not the honesty, but the lack of empathy and maybe not managing the conversation better. So yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
