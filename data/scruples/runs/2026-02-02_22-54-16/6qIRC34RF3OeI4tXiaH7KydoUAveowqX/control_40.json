We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he didn't mention it before.\n\nHmm, first, communication in relationships is key. He said he's honest, but maybe he didn't realize how his words could affect her. She had insecurities about her body, so bringing up his preference might have been hurtful. But he was truthful. However, the way he delivered it might have been too blunt without considering her feelings. \n\nHe mentioned that he prefers bigger chests, which she already knew because he avoids facing her during sex. But when she asked directly, he was honest. She felt lied to because he didn't bring it up before. But maybe he didn't want to hurt her feelings. However, not addressing her insecurities when she brought it up could be seen as not supportive.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is empathy. He might not be in the wrong for being honest, but the way he handled it could have been more sensitive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might say he's not wrong for being honest, others might say he should have addressed her insecurities more kindly. But since the user is asking for AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and impact. His intent was honesty, but the impact was hurting her. So maybe he's not the asshole because he was truthful, but he could have handled it better. \n\nAlternatively, if he knew her insecurities and still brought up his preferences, that could be seen as wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he was honest, but the situation is nuanced. I think the answer leans towards B, but I need to be sure. The key points: He was honest, but maybe didn't consider her feelings enough. The final answer is B.\n"
