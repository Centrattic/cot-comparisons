We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not being physically attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and the girlfriend is petite and flat-chested. The author admits he's never been with someone thin before and prefers bigger chests. When she asked about his feelings, he was honest that he doesn't find her chest size attractive, even though it's not a turn-off. She was hurt and felt lied to because he didn't mention it before.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are communication and emotional impact. The author was honest, which is good, but maybe he didn't consider how his honesty would affect her. He didn't bring it up before, and when she asked, he gave a straight answer that made her feel bad. But on the other hand, he's being truthful about his preferences. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he's been facing away during sex because of her chest size, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. By waiting until she brought it up, it might have been a shock to her. Also, the fact that she's insecure about it and tried on lingerie that didn't fit shows she already feels self-conscious. His response could have been more empathetic, even if he's being honest. \n\nBut is honesty a bad thing here? He didn't lie; he just didn't mention it before. Maybe the problem is that he didn't frame it in a way that reassures her. The impact of his words hurt her feelings, which suggests that he could have handled it differently. So, while he's being truthful, the way he communicated it and the timing might be the issue. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require both partners to feel valued. If his preferences affect how he interacts during intimacy, he should have discussed it more sensitively. Maybe there's a balance between honesty and compassion. Since she felt like he lied, even though he didn't, it shows that the way he delivered the truth was harmful. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional impact of his honesty and didn't communicate his feelings in a supportive way. But then again, being honest isn't inherently wrong. Hmm. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding communication in relationships. In many cases, it's better to address such issues sooner rather than later, but the method of communication matters too. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the conversation with enough care, leading to hurt feelings. Even if his preferences are valid, the way he expressed them without considering her insecurities made it hurtful. So, he's responsible for not being more considerate in his approach.\n"
