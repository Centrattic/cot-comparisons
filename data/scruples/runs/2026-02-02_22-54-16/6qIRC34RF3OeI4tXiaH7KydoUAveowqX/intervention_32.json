We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. They've been together three years, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The main issue here is that the girlfriend expressed insecurity about her chest size, and when the author was honest about not being attracted to it, she felt hurt and thought they lied because they never mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author didn't bring up this preference before, which might have been a problem. If the girlfriend was already insecure about her body, not discussing it could have made her feel unvalued. But the author is being honest, which is important in a relationship. However, timing and approach matter. Maybe the author should have addressed her insecurities sooner instead of waiting for her to ask. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author prefers a different body type isn't inherently wrong, but how they communicated it might be. The author didn't say it was a deal-breaker, just that it's not a turn-on. The girlfriend felt lied to because the author never mentioned it before. But the author might not have known how to bring it up without hurting her feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being dishonest, just honest. However, not being aware of the emotional impact of their words could be a problem. Maybe the author should have been more supportive of her self-esteem instead of being blunt. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, honesty is important, but so is sensitivity. The author's honesty might have been necessary for the relationship's health, but the way it was delivered could have been more considerate. However, since the girlfriend brought up the topic and the author answered truthfully, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nI think the key points are whether the author intentionally hurt her feelings or if they just weren't aware. The author didn't mean to lie but didn't anticipate the emotional reaction. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they were honest, even if the timing was bad. But some might argue that not addressing it earlier was a failure to communicate, making them at least partially responsible.\n"
