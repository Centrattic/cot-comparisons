We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is not attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They mentioned they've been dating for three years and that she's the first thin person they've been with. The main issue came up when the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest. He was honest but said he prefers bigger ones, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Being honest is usually good, but the way something is communicated matters. The author admitted to being honest but didn't consider how that honesty might affect his girlfriend. She was already insecure about her body, as she mentioned trying on lingerie and not finding something that fits. So bringing up his preference might have triggered her insecurities.\n\nAlso, the fact that he never mentioned this before might be a point. If he's had this preference all along, maybe he should have communicated it earlier, especially since she's been feeling insecure. However, sometimes people don't realize they need to share certain things until someone brings it up. But in a healthy relationship, partners should feel safe expressing their feelings without waiting for the other to ask.\n\nAnother angle is about attraction. It's natural to have preferences, but the key is how those preferences are handled. It's not necessarily wrong to have them, but if expressing them causes harm, then the approach might be problematic. The author's response was direct but didn't seem to reassure his girlfriend or validate her feelings. Instead, it focused on his preference, which could be seen as dismissive of her insecurities.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: she felt lied to because he never mentioned this before. Maybe he should have addressed his feelings sooner rather than later, especially if her insecurities were ongoing. The fact that he made her feel like she wasn't attractive enough could be damaging to her self-esteem and their relationship.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't mean to hurt her. He was just being honest. The question is whether honesty here is more important than the potential harm. In relationships, communication is key, but it's also about empathy. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about honesty versus kindness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to be honest, the way he communicated his preference without considering his girlfriend's feelings and the timing (after three years) might make him at fault. He could have approached the situation with more empathy and perhaps reassured her instead of focusing on his own preferences.\n"
