We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being not attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been together for 3 years. The girlfriend is insecure about her body, especially since she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him directly if he was okay with her chest size, and he admitted he prefers bigger. Now she's hurt and feels lied to because he didn't bring it up before.\n\nHmm. Communication is key in relationships. He might be honest, but timing and context matter. He waited three years to mention this preference, which she didn't know about. That could be hurtful because she's been dealing with insecurity and he didn't address it earlier. Also, the fact that he faces away during sex might have been a hint, but he didn't communicate it openly. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest now. He didn't lie; he just hadn't mentioned it before. But withholding such a personal preference, especially affecting intimacy, could be seen as not being fully honest. She might feel that he wasn't transparent, leading to her feeling unattractive and that her self-esteem was undermined. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are: honest communication is good, but if it's causing hurt and wasn't discussed when it was affecting their relationship, maybe it's his fault. Also, considering her feelings and how long he waited to bring it up. \n\nI think he is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier, especially since they impact their intimacy. Even if he's being honest now, not addressing it over three years could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs. So the answer is A.\n"
