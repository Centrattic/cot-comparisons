We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him about his feelings towards her chest size, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt, thinking he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. First, communication in relationships is crucial. He didn't bring up his preferences before, which might have made her feel like he was hiding something. But then again, he says he's being honest now. But why did he wait until she brought it up? Maybe he should have addressed it earlier if it was a concern. \n\nAlso, the way he communicated it might be an issue. Just saying he's not attracted to her chest size without validating her feelings could come off as dismissive. He should have balanced honesty with empathy. The fact that he admitted it's not a turn off but not a turn on might not be sufficient. She was already insecure, so even the slight negative might have hurt her more.\n\nAnother angle: in a long-term relationship, certain preferences can affect each other's self-esteem. If his preference for bigger chests is making her feel insecure, maybe he needs to work on accepting her body as it is. But is it his fault for having preferences? Everyone has different attractions, but how you handle them matters. \n\nThe argument could be that he's being honest, but the timing and delivery were poor. He should have addressed it when he noticed her insecurities earlier, or framed it in a way that emphasizes appreciation for her overall. Also, the fact that he avoids facing her during intimacy might have been a red flag she didn't understand before. \n\nOn the other hand, he didn't lie. He was honest when she asked. But honesty without consideration can still be harmful. So the main issue here is communication. He might not be in the wrong for having preferences, but he definitely handled it poorly, leading to hurt feelings. So maybe the answer leans towards A, but I need to consider if there's any justification. \n\nWait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If he's being truthful but it's causing harm, is he responsible? Relationships require compromise and support. If his preference is affecting her self-worth, then he might need to adjust. But the problem here is that he didn't communicate earlier. Since she brought up her insecurity, he should have been more proactive in reassuring her. By not addressing it before, he might have contributed to her feelings of inadequacy. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that while he's not lying, his lack of prior communication and the way he delivered the truth might make him the asshole here. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
