We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not being physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and this is the first time this issue has come up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is insecure about her body, which is noted as being petite and flat-chested. The author mentions that he prefers a bigger chest size but hasn't brought this up before. The girlfriend felt hurt and lied to because he didn't mention it earlier.\n\nCommunication is a key factor here. In a long-term relationship, partners usually discuss their preferences. The author waited until the girlfriend brought it up, which might have been a sensitive moment for her. Even though he was honest, the timing and context could be problematic. If the girlfriend had been trying on lingerie and was already feeling insecure, bringing up his preference in that moment might have been a shock to her.\n\nAlso, the author's choice to not mention his preference before might have been to avoid hurting her feelings, but it led to her feeling lied to. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she expected honesty about his preferences, especially after three years together. The author could have addressed his feelings in a more supportive way, maybe before the lingerie moment, to help her feel secure rather than hurt.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's preference isn't a deal-breaker for him, but it's a significant emotional issue for the girlfriend. The fact that he faces away during intercourse because of her chest size suggests that this has been an ongoing issue, even if unspoken. Not addressing it until she brought it up might have made her feel that her insecurities are being overlooked.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is being honest, but honesty can be an asshole move if it's delivered without consideration for the other person's feelings. The girlfriend's need for validation and reassurance is important in a relationship. The author's response might have been blunt without providing enough support or context about their relationship beyond physical attraction.\n\nSo, while the author isn't being dishonest per se, he could have handled the situation better by addressing his feelings earlier and more sensitively. The fact that his honesty caused emotional harm suggests that he might be in the wrong for not considering how his words would affect her and for not initiating the conversation in a more supportive manner.\n"
