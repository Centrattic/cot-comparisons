We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's not attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size, and he admitted it honestly. The girlfriend was hurt because he didn't bring it up before, and now she feels lied to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Honesty is important, especially in intimate relationships. But timing and how the information is delivered matter too. The man made an ALT account to ask this, showing he's concerned about it. He mentions that he's been with her for three years and that she's the first thin person he's been with. His past preferences were for bigger sizes, and he's not attracted to her current size. He was honest when she asked, which is good, but maybe there's a better way to handle it.\n\nWait, the girlfriend had been insecure about her chest size and tried on lingerie that didn't fit. She asked him about it, so he answered honestly. But she felt hurt because he didn't bring it up before. The question is whether being honest is the right approach here. In relationships, it's important to address such issues before they become a problem, but sometimes people might not realize how their words affect others. \n\nHowever, if he's not attracted to her body and it's affecting his behavior (like facing away during intercourse), maybe he should have brought it up sooner in a more supportive way. But he did come clean when asked. The problem might be that he didn't communicate his feelings earlier, leading her to feel like he was hiding something. \n\nBut the key point is that he was honest when she asked. If he had lied, that would be worse. However, being honest in a way that's hurtful can still be problematic. The way he delivered the information might need to be more considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not in the wrong for having preferences, but how he communicated them matters. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The answer depends on whether honesty alone justifies the hurt caused. In some cases, people might need to balance honesty with compassion. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but he could have handled it better. But according to the question, the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI think the main issue is that he didn't address it earlier when it was affecting their intimacy. But since he was honest when asked, maybe he's not at fault. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because communication is key. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it better. So if he's honest, even if it's hurtful, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are a result of his honesty, but he's not the asshole for being truthful. So B.\n"
