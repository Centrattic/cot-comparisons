We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being not attracted to his girlfriend's chest size. They've been dating almost three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked if he was okay with her being flat-chested because she was trying on lingerie and felt insecure. He admitted he prefers bigger chests, which made her upset and feel lied to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. He didn't mention this preference before, even though they've been together for a long time. Maybe he could have been more open earlier? But he's sharing it now, even if it's hard for her to hear. On the other hand, bringing it up after three years might come off as insensitive. \n\nAlso, attraction is a complex thing, but relationships require compromise. If he's being honest, that's good, but the way he communicates it matters. If his preference affects their intimacy, like him preferring her to face away, that's important for her to know. She might have felt he was hiding something. \n\nHowever, he's not suddenly rejecting her. He's just admitting a preference he's had before. But three years is a long time, and if this made her feel unloved or not accepted, that's a problem. Relationships are about mutual respect and making each other feel valued. Maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier or found a way to make her feel attractive despite his preferences. \n\nThe key points are honesty, communication timing, and emotional impact. While he was truthful, the timing and the way he presented it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's feelings of being unattractive are valid, and he could be more supportive. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the hurt caused. But I need to check if honesty without consideration is a valid point. Sometimes being honest without being kind can be an issue. So, the author might not be the asshole in the sense that he's not lying, but he's not handling it with enough sensitivity. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he admitted it after she brought up her insecurity, maybe he should have been more proactive in reassuring her before. Hmm.\n"
