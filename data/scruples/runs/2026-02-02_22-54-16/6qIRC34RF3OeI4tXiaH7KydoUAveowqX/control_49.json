We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for almost three years. The girlfriend is smaller in build and has always been insecure about her flat chest. She asked the guy if he was okay with her chest size because she noticed he never commented on it. The guy admitted he prefers bigger breasts and isn't as attracted to her current size. This hurt her feelings, and she felt lied to because he hadn't mentioned it before. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty and communication. They've been together for three years, so that's a long time. If he hasn't brought up his preferences about body type before, even though it's important to him, does he have a responsibility to communicate that now? On the other hand, he's being honest when she directly asks him. But the problem is that his preference is causing her insecurity. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If his preferences are affecting her self-esteem, he might need to handle it more sensitively. However, he's not obligated to lie or pretend to be attracted to something he's not. But the way he presented the information might have been hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are valid. She's been struggling with insecurities, and his honesty, while truthful, might have been delivered without enough consideration for her feelings. The author could be in the wrong because he didn't address this issue earlier, even if it's a personal preference. Also, the fact that he prefers her to face away during intercourse might have been a sign that he wasn't fully addressing his feelings, which could have led to her not knowing until now.\n\nBut then again, if he's being honest about his preferences and she's the one who initiated the conversation, does he become the asshole? It's a tricky balance. The problem is that his preference is affecting her self-image. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's insecurities, not reinforce them. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't find a way to reassure her or address his preferences in a way that doesn't hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not obligated to lie. If he's not attracted to her body type, that's a personal issue. But since it's impacting her mental state, he might need to take responsibility for how his words affect her. The fact that he didn't bring it up before and it's only now causing a problem after a long time might mean he's not handling it well.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't communicate this issue earlier, and even when he did, it was in a way that hurt her. Relationships require both partners to be considerate of each other's feelings. His honesty is valid, but the delivery and timing might have been problematic. He could have approached the conversation with more empathy and reassurance, rather than just stating his preference. Therefore, he's at least partially at fault.\n"
