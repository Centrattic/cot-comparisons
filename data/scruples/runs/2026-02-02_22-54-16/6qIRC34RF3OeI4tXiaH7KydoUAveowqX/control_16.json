We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend asked if he's okay with her flat chest after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt and like he lied to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being honest about his preferences. But the girlfriend has been insecure about her body for a while, and this comment made her feel unattractive. The key points here are communication and the impact of his words. \n\nIn a relationship, honesty is important, but so is how you communicate. The author didn't bring up this preference before, and when he did, it was in a situation where the girlfriend was already vulnerable (trying on lingerie and feeling insecure). Even if he's honest, the timing and the way he delivered the information might have been hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend felt like he lied because he never mentioned it before. The author might not have realized that his preference could affect her self-esteem. The fact that she was already in a mental funk about her body makes the situation more sensitive. \n\nSo, while the author isn't lying and is being honest about his preferences, the way he handled the conversation might have been inconsiderate. It's possible he could have addressed her insecurities earlier or found a more supportive way to express his feelings without hurting her. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because his comment, though honest, was delivered in a way that harmed his girlfriend's feelings without considering her insecurities."
