We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for 3 years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He mentioned he prefers bigger chest sizes, but it's not a dealbreaker. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought he was lying because he never brought it up before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for a while, and the author is honest about his preferences. He didn't lie; he just didn't mention it before. The girlfriend's insecurity is valid, but the author's honesty is also important. Communication is key in relationships. The author did tell her the truth when she asked, but maybe he could have approached it more sensitively. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend felt hurt and left, which is significant. The author's actions might have caused emotional pain. But he wasn't dishonest. The problem might be that he didn't realize how important this issue was to her. So, is it the author's fault for being honest but not considering her feelings? Or is it about the way he delivered the honesty? \n\nIn relationships, how you communicate matters. The author could have been more empathetic. But he was honest, which is generally a good trait. However, if his honesty hurt her without being considerate, maybe he's in the wrong. But the user thinks he's not in the wrong. I need to decide based on whether the author's actions were unreasonable. \n\nIt's a tough call. The author's honesty is on one side, her emotional response on the other. The answer might depend on whether the author's expression was necessary or if he should have handled it differently. Since the girlfriend's feelings were hurt, maybe the author should have been more careful. But he didn't lie. So maybe it's a B, but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings enough. Hmm.\n"
