We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple in a three-year relationship where the guy isn't attracted to his girlfriend's chest size, which is smaller than what he's used to. He made a comment about preferring bigger chests, and now she's hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but timing and approach matter. The guy was honest, which is good, but maybe he didn't consider how his words might affect her. She had already expressed insecurity about her body, so bringing up his preference in that moment could be hurtful. \n\nHe mentioned that he usually prefers her facing away during intercourse because of her chest size. That might come off as avoiding her, which she could interpret as not finding her attractive. The fact that she felt he was lying before is a red flag. If he hadn't communicated this before, she might have felt blindsided. \n\nAlso, the context of her asking about her chest size during a Netflix night suggests she was already vulnerable. His response might have been too direct without offering reassurance or affirmation of other aspects of her body or their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance honesty with empathy. While being truthful is necessary, it's equally important to express that truth in a way that doesn't undermine the other person's self-esteem. The guy could have acknowledged her insecurities and affirmed her attractiveness beyond just physical attributes. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did he communicate his preferences in a way that respects her feelings? Probably not. Even though he was honest, the manner and context might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
