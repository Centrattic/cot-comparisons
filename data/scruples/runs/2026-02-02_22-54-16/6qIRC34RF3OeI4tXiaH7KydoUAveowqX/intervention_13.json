We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been with his girlfriend for almost three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She's always been insecure about her flat chest, and recently brought it up while they were watching Netflix. He admitted he's not attracted to that and prefers bigger chests, even saying that's why he has her face away during sex. She felt hurt and accused him of lying.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty in a relationship and how to handle personal preferences regarding physical attraction. The author is being honest, but maybe the way he communicated it was harsh. The girlfriend's insecurity is significant here. Even if he's truthful, if he didn't consider her feelings or the context, it could be seen as insensitive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial, but it's also about how and when you communicate. Bringing up something that could hurt your partner's feelings, especially after they've expressed insecurity for years, might not be the best approach. The fact that he didn't mention this preference before suggests he might have known it would affect her. Even if it's the truth, the timing and delivery matter. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. If she's been insecure about this for a long time and he's never addressed it positively, suddenly bringing it up could feel like a betrayal. The author's honesty is important, but it's possible he didn't balance it with empathy. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being attracted to her in that way, the way he handled the situation might have been. The question is whether his honesty is justified or if he should have considered her feelings more. Since the post is asking if he's the asshole, the answer might lean towards A if the delivery was harmful, even if the content is honest. But I need to make sure. The user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but I think the issue is more about how he communicated his preference rather than the preference itself. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
