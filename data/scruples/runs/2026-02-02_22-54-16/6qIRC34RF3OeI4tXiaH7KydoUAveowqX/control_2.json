We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been honest about preferring bigger chests, and this caused her emotional pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The girlfriend was trying to open up about her insecurities, so she probably expected some reassurance. The author's response was honest but might have been hurtful. Was he wrong to be honest? Maybe if he didn't consider the timing or her feelings. But is honesty always the right approach here?\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and mutual respect. If they're in a relationship, both partners should feel respected. The author's preference might be valid, but how he communicated it could be an issue. Did he address her insecurities constructively, or just state his preference without offering support?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend felt like he lied because he didn't bring it up before. The author might have thought he didn't need to mention it since it wasn't a deal-breaker for him. But not talking about it could lead to misunderstandings. Maybe he should have had that conversation earlier when she started feeling insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his preferences, which is important. But honesty needs to be balanced with empathy. If he's not attracted to her body, maybe there's a deeper issue about acceptance. The fact that he avoids facing her during intercourse might indicate that his preference is affecting their intimacy in a way that could be a problem.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible. He might have mishandled the situation by not addressing her insecurities earlier and being blunt during a vulnerable moment. While honesty is important, the way he delivered it may have been harmful without offering reassurance or alternatives. The key is whether he considered her feelings and tried to support her despite his preference. If he was honest but didn't take her emotional state into account, he's at least partly responsible for hurting her. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something else.\n"
