We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for three years. The author mentions that he's not attracted to his girlfriend's chest size, preferring a larger size. His girlfriend felt hurt and thought he was being dishonest, especially since he never mentioned this before. He was honest, but it seems like it came as a surprise to her, which caused emotional distress.\n\nNow, the key points here are honesty in relationships and communication. The author was truthful about his preferences, but maybe he didn't consider how it would affect her. On one hand, honesty is important in a relationship. People have different preferences, and it's okay to have those. But on the other hand, bringing it up in a way that makes her feel insecure could be hurtful, especially if it's something she's already self-conscious about.\n\nThe girlfriend had been trying on lingerie and was already insecure about her chest. The author's admission might have triggered her insecurities. Even though he didn't mean to hurt her, the way he communicated his preferences could have been more considerate. The fact that he kept this to himself for three years and then brought it up suddenly might have made her feel like he was hiding something or being dishonest, even if his intent was just to be honest.\n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers a different body type doesn't make him wrong, but how he handled the situation is questionable. Communication in relationships is about balance\u2014being honest but also being mindful of the other person's feelings. If he had addressed it earlier, maybe in a supportive way, it could have been handled better. But bringing it up in the moment when she was already insecure might not have been the best approach.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his preferences, which isn't inherently wrong. But it also depends on the approach. If he had been more sensitive and considered the timing and method of his communication, it might have been better. However, since he was truthful, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have been more considerate.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that he kept this to himself for three years and then brought it up in a way that hurt her could be seen as inconsiderate, making him the asshole. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether honesty is an excuse for hurting someone's feelings, or if there's a responsibility to communicate in a way that's kind yet honest.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to navigate these topics with care. So, while he's not wrong for having preferences, the way he communicated them might be problematic. However, the text says he was honest, and the girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't bring it up earlier. So, maybe he's not in the wrong for being honest, but he could have handled it better. The answer is a bit nuanced, but the question asks for A or B. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong for being honest, even though the timing and approach could be improved.\n"
