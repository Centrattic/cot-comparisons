We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not being attracted to his girlfriend's chest size and finally admitting it after she brought up her insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for three years, and the girlfriend is the first thin person he's been with. He's been with others who were bigger and prefers a certain body type. The girlfriend's insecurity about her flat chest led her to ask him directly. He was honest but admitted he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt and like he lied.\n\nNow, evaluating his actions. Honesty is important in a relationship, but timing and empathy matter. He waited until after three years to bring up this preference. Even though he was honest, the way he delivered it might have been hurtful. He didn't acknowledge her feelings or reassure her that his feelings for her aren't based solely on her body. Instead, he focused on his preference, which could be seen as dismissive of her insecurities.\n\nAlso, the fact that he mentioned facing away during intercourse might have added to her feeling devalued. While he's not obligated to lie, the impact of his honesty without support or understanding could make him the asshole. Relationships require both honesty and kindness. His response lacked emotional support, which is crucial when addressing a partner's insecurities.\n\nSo, considering both honesty and emotional consideration, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
