We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for 3 years. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from his past partners who were bigger. She asked him about his feelings on her chest size after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. He was honest that he prefers a bigger chest, which led to her feeling hurt and ending the night by going home. She felt he lied because he never mentioned this before.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know my take. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was honest about his preferences. It's possible that he's not the asshole for being truthful about his physical attractions. Everyone has preferences, and he didn't lie; he just didn't mention it before because maybe it wasn't an issue. He expressed that it's not a deal-breaker but not a turn-on. Honesty in a relationship is important for trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt because he didn't mention this before. She might have felt that her insecurities were amplified by his honesty. Even if he was honest, the timing and context could be problematic. Maybe there's a lack of communication about each other's needs and insecurities. The author could have addressed her insecurities earlier or framed his honesty in a more supportive way. However, the act of being honest isn't inherently wrong, but the impact on her feelings is a factor.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If being honest isn't the issue, then maybe the problem is how he communicated it. However, the user is leaning towards AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the community often considers intent and context. The author's intent was to be honest, not to hurt her. So perhaps he's not the asshole. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is about right or wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's insecurity led her to ask the question. Maybe she needed reassurance, and his honest answer, while truthful, didn't provide the support she needed. But again, it's about whether he's wrong. If he's not lying and is being honest, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions aren't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
