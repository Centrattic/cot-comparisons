We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The girlfriend brought up the topic because she was insecure about her flat chest. The author admitted he prefers bigger chests and that he's been facing her away during intercourse. She felt hurt, thinking he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let's unpack this.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author didn't bring up this preference before, which might have made the girlfriend feel like he was hiding something. But when she asked directly, he was honest. Was he supposed to bring it up earlier? Maybe. Not bringing it up could be seen as not being open, which can lead to hurt feelings.\n\nThen there's the aspect of body image. The girlfriend has been insecure about her chest, so the author's comment might have triggered that insecurity. Even if it's the truth, being honest in a way that harms your partner's self-esteem could be problematic. The fact that he uses this preference as a reason to have her face away might make her feel less valued. \n\nBut the author is being honest about his preferences. Is honesty a defense here? Relationships require both honesty and kindness. If the truth is delivered in a way that's hurtful, even if it's true, it might still be the wrong approach. The girlfriend might feel that after three years, he should have expressed this earlier, especially since he's with someone different from his previous partners.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's being truthful. However, the timing and the impact matter. The fact that she was already insecure and he brought it up in response to her question complicates things. He might not be intentionally cruel, but the result is hurt feelings. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. If he had communicated his preferences earlier, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But since she asked directly, he answered honestly. However, the way he framed it (using it as a reason for his actions) might have been more hurtful than necessary. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of prior communication and the impact on her self-esteem. Even if he's truthful, the way he handles it could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he is in the wrong because he didn't address this earlier and his honesty might have been delivered without considering her feelings.\n"
