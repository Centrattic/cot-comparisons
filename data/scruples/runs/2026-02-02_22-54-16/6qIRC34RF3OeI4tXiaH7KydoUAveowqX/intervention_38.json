We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being honest about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The girlfriend is thin and petite, which is a contrast to the author's previous partners. The situation started when the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest, leading him to be honest about preferring bigger breasts. She felt hurt and thought he lied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for three years, and he's never mentioned this preference before. Honesty in relationships is important, but timing and delivery matter. By not bringing this up earlier, especially since she already had insecurities, he might have contributed to her feelings of inadequacy. However, he did make an effort to be honest, which is a positive aspect.\n\nOn the other hand, communication is key in relationships. While he was truthful, he might have handled it more sensitively. The fact that she was trying on lingerie and already self-conscious means that bringing up body image issues in that moment could be hurtful. He should have addressed this earlier or found a more supportive way to express his feelings without making her feel like she's not attractive.\n\nAlso, the immediate reaction of her leaving and texting him later shows the impact of his words. He might not be in the wrong for being honest, but he could have managed the conversation differently. The question is whether honesty excuses the hurt caused. In relationships, sometimes honesty needs to be coupled with empathy to avoid harm. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being honest, but he could have handled the situation better. The answer might lean towards 'B' (not in the wrong), but there's room for debate on the approach he took.\n"
