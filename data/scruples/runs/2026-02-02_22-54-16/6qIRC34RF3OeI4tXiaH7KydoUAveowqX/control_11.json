We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been dating for three years. The girlfriend is insecure about her chest size, which is flat, and she noticed the guy never commented on it. They were watching Netflix when she asked him directly if he was okay with it. He admitted he prefers bigger chests, which made her upset. Now she's hurt and feels lied to because he never mentioned this before.\n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty and communication in a relationship. The guy is being honest about his preferences, but the timing and the impact on his girlfriend's feelings are key factors. The user is asking if he's the asshole for being honest but causing emotional distress.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. However, there's a difference between being honest and being hurtful. The guy didn't bring up his preference before, even though his girlfriend was insecure about this. When he did mention it, it was in a situation where she was already vulnerable (trying on lingerie, feeling insecure), which might have made the conversation more painful for her.\n\nThe question is whether his honesty is justified. On one hand, he's truthful about his preferences, which is important for both partners to know. On the other hand, he didn't consider how this revelation would affect her emotional well-being, especially given her pre-existing insecurities. He also waited until she brought up the topic and then delivered the honesty in a way that felt like a criticism.\n\nIn many cases, people appreciate honesty, but it's also about how and when it's shared. If he had addressed her insecurities earlier in a supportive way, maybe validated her feelings while explaining his preferences, the outcome might have been different. By waiting until she was already feeling insecure and then being direct without cushioning the blow, he might have come across as insensitive.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he admitted to preferring bigger chests and mentioned avoiding facing her during intercourse because of this might have made her feel like her body isn't accepted. Even if it's not a turn-off, it's not a turn-on, which can be hurtful if one partner has long-standing insecurities.\n\nSo, considering all this, the guy might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier and in a more supportive manner, leading to emotional harm. His honesty is valid, but the lack of consideration for her feelings is where the problem lies.\n"
