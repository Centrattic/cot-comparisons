We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that he's been with her for three years, she's the first thin person he's been with. He prefers bigger chests and didn't mention it before. When she asked, he was honest about it. Now she feels hurt and thinks he lied.\n\nHmm. So, is he wrong? Well, being honest is usually good, but timing and how it's delivered matter. He didn't bring it up before, even though they've been together three years. That might be an issue. Also, the fact that she was insecure about her body and tried on lingerie, and he didn't address it until she brought it up. Maybe he should have noticed her insecurities and communicated earlier. But when she asked, he was honest. \n\nOn one hand, honesty is important in a relationship. But on the other hand, not acknowledging her insecurities for three years and then dropping that bomb might have been hurtful. Maybe he could have handled it more sensitively. Also, the fact that he prefers her facing away during intercourse might imply he's avoiding something, which she noticed. \n\nBut he's not in the wrong for being honest about his preferences. However, not addressing her insecurities when he saw them, and waiting until she confronted him, might be a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether his actions were considerate of her feelings. If he was aware of her insecurities and didn't address them until she asked, maybe that's where he went wrong. But if he was just honest when asked, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong for being honest, but could have handled it better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was honest and didn't lie, maybe he's not. But the fact that he didn't support her earlier might be an issue. Hmm. I'm a bit split here. But since he was honest when she asked, and didn't lie, then technically he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
