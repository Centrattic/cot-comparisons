We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. The author says they've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He mentions that most of his previous partners had bigger chests, and he prefers that. The situation came up when she asked him about his feelings on her chest size, and he was honest that it's not a turn-on for him. She was hurt by his honesty and left, feeling like he lied to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had been insecure about her body, especially her chest size, and had been trying on lingerie that didn't fit. She brought up the topic, which suggests she was already vulnerable and seeking reassurance. The author's response, while truthful, might have been blunt without offering the support she needed. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, but the timing and delivery matter. Even if the truth is necessary, the way it's delivered can affect the other person's feelings. The author didn't consider the emotional impact of his honesty. He could have acknowledged her insecurities first before stating his preference, showing that he still finds her attractive overall. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't bring this up before might contribute to her feeling lied to, even if he was being honest. People often avoid certain topics to avoid hurting their partner's feelings. However, in this case, the girlfriend had already initiated the conversation, so the author's response was in the context of her seeking validation. \n\nThe outcome was that she felt hurt and left, which indicates that the way he communicated his preference was harmful. Even if his feelings are genuine, the method of expressing them without empathy could be seen as the issue. \n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for having his preferences, the way he handled the situation and the impact on his girlfriend's emotions might make him at fault for not being more considerate in his response. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
