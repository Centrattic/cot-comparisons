We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy not being attracted to his girlfriend's body type, specifically her chest size. They've been together for 3 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is petite and flat-chested, which is different from the guy's past preferences. The key point here is communication. The author admits he's never mentioned this preference before, and when the girlfriend brought it up, he was honest but caused her hurt feelings.\n\nCommunication in relationships is crucial. If one partner has specific preferences that affect their partner's self-esteem, it's important to address them constructively. The author was honest, but the way he communicated might have been blunt without considering her feelings. He didn't mention if he appreciated other aspects of her body or if he expressed that his preference isn't a deal-breaker but something he's aware of.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's insecurity is a red flag. She was already self-conscious about her figure, and the author's honesty might have triggered those insecurities. It's possible he could have softened his response, maybe by affirming her attractiveness in other ways or discussing how to make her feel better about herself despite his preferences.\n\nAnother angle is that the author admitted to preferring facing away during intercourse, which might indicate a pattern of discomfort. If this wasn't addressed before, it's a sign that he might have been avoiding the issue rather than working through it with her.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is empathy. The author's honesty might be seen as necessary, but the impact on his partner's emotional well-being is significant. The question is whether his honesty was delivered in a way that respected her feelings. Since he didn't consider her emotional response and his admission led to her feeling lied about, it suggests he didn't handle the communication well.\n\nSo, even though he was honest, the way he communicated his preferences without considering the emotional impact might make him the asshole here. The answer would depend on whether honesty without empathy is justified. In most cases, communication that hurts a partner's feelings without a constructive approach is seen as problematic.\n"
