We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin partner they've had. The girlfriend was insecure and brought up the issue after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The person was honest about preferring bigger chests and mentioned facing away during intercourse.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and the impact of their honesty. The girlfriend felt hurt and betrayed because the issue wasn't discussed earlier. The person argues they were just being honest. But in a long-term relationship, it's important to share such preferences early to avoid hurt feelings. The fact that the girlfriend had insecurities about her body makes this even more sensitive. The person might have known her insecurities but didn't address them, leading to a situation where the truth is revealed in a way that harms her self-esteem. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt lied to. Even if the person is honest, the timing and lack of prior discussion could be seen as insensitive. The person should have brought up their preferences earlier to avoid this situation. So, the answer might be A, they're in the wrong. But maybe not? If they were honest and didn't know how to express it better... Wait, but in relationships, communication is key. Not addressing her insecurities and then being blunt later can definitely hurt. So A makes sense.\n"
