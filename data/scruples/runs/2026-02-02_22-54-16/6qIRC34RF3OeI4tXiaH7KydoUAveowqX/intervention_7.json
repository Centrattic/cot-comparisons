We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest, and telling her honestly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been with his girlfriend for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. Most of his past partners were bigger, and he prefers bigger chests. The girlfriend became insecure after he mentioned not being attracted to her chest size. She felt hurt and accused him of lying because he hadn't brought it up before.\n\nNow, thinking about communication in relationships. Honesty is important, but so is how it's delivered. The author was honest, but maybe he didn't consider how his words would affect her. He didn't just say he wasn't attracted to her; he specifically called out her chest size and mentioned preferring bigger ones. That could be hurtful, even if his intention was to be truthful.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend had been struggling with body image, as mentioned she tried on lingerie and had insecurities. The author didn't address her feelings first but instead focused on his preferences. In a healthy relationship, partners should validate each other's feelings. He might have missed the opportunity to reassure her before being honest about his preferences.\n\nAnother angle is that he didn't mention the part about her facing away during intercourse until she mentioned her insecurity. That might have been a trigger. Maybe he should have handled the conversation differently, perhaps by acknowledging her feelings of insecurity first before stating his preferences.\n\nSo, while being honest isn't inherently wrong, the timing and manner of his honesty could be problematic. He might not be the asshole entirely, but he could have approached it more compassionately. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is about responsibility, maybe he's not in the wrong because he was honest, but he could have been more considerate. But in terms of the situation, maybe he is in the wrong because his honesty hurt her and he didn't manage it well.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views. Some might say honesty is better, others that compassion is key. But in the context of AITA, usually, being honest but causing hurt is seen as an issue if it's unkind. So perhaps the answer is A (in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings when delivering his honesty.\n"
