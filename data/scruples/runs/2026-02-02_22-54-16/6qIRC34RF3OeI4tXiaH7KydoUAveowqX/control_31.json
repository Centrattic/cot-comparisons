We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the guy has been with his girlfriend for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with women who have bigger chests. She asked him directly if he's okay with her flat chest because she's insecure about it. He admitted that he prefers bigger chests and that it's not a turn-on for him. This made her feel hurt and led her to leave. She felt like he lied because he didn't bring this up before.\n\nSo, the question is: Is he the asshole here? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, communication is key in relationships. The woman had been insecure about her body and tried to bring it up. He didn't address it before, but when she asked, he gave his honest answer. However, the way he delivered it might have been abrupt. Maybe he could have been more sensitive. But the post says he was honest. \n\nIn relationships, people have different preferences. But if someone is making their partner feel insecure or not attractive, that's a problem. He admitted that his preference affects his attraction, which could be hurtful. Even if it's the truth, being honest in a way that harms the partner's feelings isn't good. He might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how his words would affect her, especially since she was already insecure. \n\nAlternatively, some might say he's not in the wrong because he's being honest. But in relationships, honesty should be balanced with kindness. If he didn't mention it before and just said it when she brought it up, maybe he didn't support her enough. The fact that she felt lied about suggests that he didn't communicate his feelings properly over time. So, probably A (he's in the wrong).\n"
