We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and he's the first thin person he's been with. She's insecure about her flat chest, and he admitted he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about honesty versus hurting feelings. The author was honest, which is important in a relationship, but the way he communicated it might have been a problem. He said he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger, which led to her feeling unattractive and him choosing positions during sex to avoid facing her. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. He didn't bring it up before, which might have caused her to feel like he was hiding something. But he did tell her honestly when she asked. On the other hand, not addressing her insecurities proactively could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's been in the relationship for three years and never mentioned it before, even though she was insecure, might mean he could have been more supportive or found a better way to address it. But he's telling the truth about his preferences. However, the way he delivered it might have been harsh. \n\nI think the key factors are: he was honest, but maybe not empathetic enough. Honesty is good, but it's also about how you handle sensitive topics. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The answer would probably be B (Not in the wrong) because he was honest, even if it hurt her. But some might argue that he should have communicated his preferences earlier or more sensitively. But since he was upfront when asked, I lean towards B.\n"
