We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. From the Reddit-style question, the key points are that he's been with his girlfriend for three years, she's the first thin person he's been with, and he's more attracted to a bigger chest. The situation arose when she asked about his feelings regarding her chest size after trying on lingerie. He told her honestly that he prefers a bigger size, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics of his actions. Being honest is generally seen as positive, but it's also important to consider the context and how it affects the other person. In a long-term relationship, communication is key. However, bringing up such a sensitive topic after three years might be problematic. Why didn't he address this earlier? If he's been avoiding facing her because he prefers her facing away, that might indicate he wasn't being fully honest or considerate of her feelings.\n\nAlso, the way he communicated it could be an issue. Just stating a preference without acknowledging her feelings or the potential hurt it might cause might be seen as insensitive. Even if he's being honest, the delivery matters. He should have considered how his words might impact her self-esteem, especially since she's already insecure about her body.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not lying. He's expressing his genuine preferences. But in relationships, there's a balance between honesty and kindness. The fact that she felt lied to because he never mentioned it before suggests that he didn't communicate his feelings in a way that included her. Partners should feel comfortable discussing their preferences, but it's also about mutual respect and how these preferences affect the other person.\n\nAnother angle is whether his preference is a deal-breaker. He says it's not a turn-off, just not a turn-on. That might be different from something that's a deal-breaker, but it's still affecting their intimacy. However, relationships require compromise, and if he's not attracted to her in a key area, that's a legitimate concern. But he should have addressed it earlier rather than waiting for her to bring it up and then delivering the news in a way that hurt her.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a lot of pressure around body image, and partners should support each other. His response might have contributed to her insecurity. Maybe he could have framed his honesty in a way that validated her while explaining his preferences. For example, instead of just saying he prefers bigger, he could have discussed how he's attracted to her in other ways or how he's learning to appreciate her body.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while honesty is important, the timing and delivery of the message, along with the lack of prior communication, might place the responsibility on the author for not being more considerate. His preference is valid, but the way he expressed it without considering her feelings could be seen as inconsiderate, making him the asshole.\n"
