We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for three years, and he's been honest about his preferences before. The girlfriend mentions she's insecure about her flat chest, which he didn't realize was affecting her this much. He tells her the truth, which hurts her feelings.\n\nSo, the main points are: communication and honesty. He didn't lie; he just didn't know how to handle the situation. But he didn't consider how his honesty would make her feel. She might feel like he didn't support her or validate her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he's been with someone for three years, maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier, especially since she's been bringing it up. By not acknowledging her feelings and just stating his preference, he might have been insensitive. \n\nHowever, he wasn't lying. He was honest about his attraction, which is a valid point. But the way he delivered the truth might have been harsh. Perhaps he could have softened it more or shown empathy. \n\nThe question is whether honesty without consideration is wrong. Some might say he's in the right because he's being truthful, but others would argue that he should have handled it more carefully to avoid hurting her. \n\nIn the end, the key is whether he's responsible for not addressing her insecurities over three years and how he communicated his feelings. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't manage the conversation with enough care, even if his intentions were honest.\n"
