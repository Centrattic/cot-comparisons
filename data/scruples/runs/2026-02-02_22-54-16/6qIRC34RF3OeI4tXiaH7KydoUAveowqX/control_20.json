We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not being attracted to his girlfriend's flat chest and preferring a larger size. The key points here are communication, honesty, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he hasn't been with someone thin before and has a preference for bigger chests. However, he only brought this up after his girlfriend expressed insecurity about her chest size. The girlfriend felt hurt because he had never mentioned this before, leading her to feel like he lied. \n\nNow, communication is crucial in relationships. The author did share his honest thoughts, but the timing and context might be problematic. He didn't address her insecurities earlier, and bringing up his preference in that moment could have been insensitive. The fact that he usually has her face away during sex might indicate that he's been avoiding the issue for a while. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his preferences, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, honesty should be paired with empathy and consideration for the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's insecurity was triggered by his comments, which might suggest that he didn't approach the conversation with enough care. \n\nThe question is whether the author's honesty justifies the hurt he caused. While honesty is important, it's also about how it's communicated and when. Since the author didn't address this issue before, especially when his girlfriend had mentioned her insecurities, it's possible that he could have handled it more thoughtfully. The fact that she felt lied to implies that she expected more discussion about their preferences earlier. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't wrong for being honest, but he might be at fault for not communicating his preferences earlier and in a more empathetic manner. His actions hurt his partner's feelings, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the timing and delivery of his honesty caused emotional harm without prior consideration.\n"
