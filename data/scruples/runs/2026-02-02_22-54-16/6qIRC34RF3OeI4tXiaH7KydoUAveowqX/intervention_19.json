We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body type. The situation is that he's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He prefers bigger chests, which he admitted to her. Now she's hurt and feels lied to because he didn't mention this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. In a long-term relationship, communication is key. The author said he was honest when she asked, but he didn't bring it up before. The girlfriend felt that not mentioning his preference was a lie. But is it a lie if he didn't say it before? Maybe he wasn't asked, but when she brought up her insecurities, he answered truthfully. \n\nOn the other hand, not addressing her insecurities might have contributed to her feeling insecure. He might have thought that not bringing it up was avoiding an issue, but she needed validation. The fact that he prefers a different body type but still chose her suggests that attraction isn't solely based on physical traits, but honesty can still be a factor in her self-esteem.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If he was honest when she asked, maybe not. But if he had ignored her feelings and didn't consider how his honesty might affect her, that could be a problem. The key is whether his honesty was delivered in a supportive way. He didn't lie, but maybe he could have approached the conversation more sensitively. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer might be a nuanced \"no\" because he was honest when asked, but there's room for improvement in how he handles her insecurities moving forward.\n"
