We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin, petite, and has a flat chest, which is different from his previous partners who were bigger. The girlfriend asked if he's okay with her chest size because she felt insecure, especially after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt and like he lied to her. She felt he didn't communicate this before, leading to her feeling unattractive.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is crucial. The author didn't bring up his preferences before, even though the girlfriend had insecurities. When she asked, he was honest but maybe not in a way that was supportive. Expressing preferences can be okay, but it's important to validate the partner's feelings. The author's honesty might have been hurtful because it wasn't framed in a way that reassured her of his attraction in other areas. He also mentioned preferring her to face away during sex, which could add to her feeling objectified or unappreciated. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her insecurity was confirmed by his honesty. The author didn't consider how his words might affect her emotionally, even if his intention was to be truthful. In relationships, honesty should be balanced with empathy. The fact that he didn't address her insecurities earlier and then delivered his preference in a way that hurt her suggests he should have handled it more carefully. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for having preferences, the way he communicated them and the lack of prior communication about her insecurities likely made him the asshole. He should have been more supportive and maybe found a way to reassure her that he finds her attractive overall, not just focused on one aspect.\n"
