We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he hasn't been attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests. She felt hurt because this came up after three years of dating, and he didn't mention it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a long-term relationship. If someone has a preference that affects their partner's feelings, when is the right time to bring it up? The writer says he didn't know how to bring it up before, but three years is a long time. The girlfriend had been insecure about her body, so maybe she expected more reassurance from him. \n\nBut on the other hand, the user is being honest. If he's not attracted to her in a certain way, is he wrong for being truthful? However, timing and communication style matter. Maybe he could have expressed his feelings in a more supportive way, emphasizing that he still cares for her despite not being physically attracted to that specific part. \n\nAlso, the fact that she tried on lingerie and felt insecure that day might be a trigger. If he noticed her trying to fit in certain clothes and didn't mention anything, maybe she felt neglected. But he said he didn't know how to respond. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Holding in something for three years might have hurt her, even if it's the truth. But the user's intention was honesty, not to hurt. However, actions speak louder than words. If he consistently avoided facing her during intimacy, maybe that's a sign of discomfort that should have been addressed earlier.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, honesty is important, but on the other, he didn't consider how it might affect her feelings after years together. Maybe he should have approached it more sensitively. But he didn't lie; he was truthful when asked. \n\nI think the answer might be a bit of both. However, since the question is a yes or no for AITA, the community might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier and in a more supportive manner. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B (No). Hmm.\n"
