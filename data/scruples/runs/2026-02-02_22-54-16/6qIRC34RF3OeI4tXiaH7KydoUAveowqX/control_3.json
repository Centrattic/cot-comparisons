We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for three years, and the girlfriend has been insecure about her body, especially her chest size. She mentioned trying on lingerie that didn't fit and feeling unattractive. The author then told her he prefers bigger breasts, which upset her. She felt like he lied because he never mentioned this before.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and emotional impact. The author didn't hide his preference from the start but brought it up when she was already feeling insecure. Even though he was honest, the timing and way he delivered the information might have been hurtful. In a long-term relationship, partners should be mindful of each other's insecurities. The fact that he kept this to himself for three years and then revealed it when she was vulnerable might be seen as insensitive.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014feeling hurt and like he lied\u2014suggests that the author's honesty, while truthful, wasn't considerate of her feelings. Honesty is important, but it should be balanced with empathy. The author could have addressed her insecurity earlier or framed his preferences in a way that affirmed his overall attraction to her, rather than focusing solely on the part that didn't appeal to him.\n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for having preferences, the way he communicated them may have been damaging. The main issue is the impact on his partner's self-esteem, which is a significant factor in determining if he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his honesty wasn't handled with care, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
