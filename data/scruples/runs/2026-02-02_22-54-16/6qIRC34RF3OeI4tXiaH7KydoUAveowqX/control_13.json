We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The couple has been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin and has been insecure about her chest size, especially since she's the first thin person the author has been with. She asked the author if he was okay with her flat chest, and he admitted he prefers a bigger size. She felt hurt because he hadn't mentioned this before, leading to her feeling lied to.\n\nSo, the key points are: honesty vs. hurting feelings. The author was honest, which is generally good, but maybe the way he delivered it was abrupt. The girlfriend had existing insecurities, so maybe he could have framed it differently to reassure her. Also, not bringing up this preference before might have contributed to her feeling blindsided. \n\nIn relationships, communication is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. Since he's been with her for three years and hasn't mentioned this before, bringing it up suddenly when she's vulnerable (trying on lingerie and feeling insecure) could be unkind. He might have hurt her by not being empathetic enough. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his preferences, which is fair. But the way he communicated it might have been insensitive. The answer hinges on whether honesty requires consideration of the other person's feelings. \n\nMost people would say that while honesty is important, it's also necessary to communicate in a way that's respectful and supportive. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, since the girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it before, maybe he should have addressed it sooner or in a more supportive manner. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings when bringing up something she's already insecure about, and the timing and delivery were hurtful.\n"
