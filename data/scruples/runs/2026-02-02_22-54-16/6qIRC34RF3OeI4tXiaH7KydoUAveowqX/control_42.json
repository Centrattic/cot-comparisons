We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is not attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. He mentions that he's with his first thin partner and has been with bigger girls before. The girlfriend brought up the issue because she was insecure and had been trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The guy then told her honestly that he prefers bigger breasts, which made her feel hurt and like he lied to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. The guy said he was honest, but maybe he could have handled it differently. The key points here are honesty vs. hurting feelings. The girlfriend was already insecure about her body, so bringing up a preference that she wasn't aware of might have been a shock. Even if he's honest, the way he delivered it could have been more considerate. \n\nAlso, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If the guy knew about her insecurities, he should have been more mindful. Instead of just stating his preference bluntly, maybe he could have acknowledged her feelings first or framed it in a way that emphasized his overall attraction to her beyond her chest size. \n\nAnother angle is that he had never mentioned this before, which she took as a lie. Honesty is important, but timing and context matter. If he had addressed her insecurities earlier, maybe there wouldn't have been a surprise. The fact that he only mentioned it after she asked might not be entirely his fault, but he could have been more proactive in reassuring her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the intention was honest, but the impact was hurtful. That's a common issue where people focus on their intention without considering the effect. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his honesty was delivered in a way that hurt her feelings, especially without prior discussion. However, some might argue that he's not wrong for being honest about his preferences. But in the context of their relationship and her known insecurities, not addressing it sooner and in a kinder manner could make him the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A, but I'm a bit torn. The key is whether honesty overrides the need for empathy. Since he caused her pain, even if it's the truth, he's probably in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively.\n"
