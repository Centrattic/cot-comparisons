We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The key points here are communication, honesty, and the impact of his words.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's been with his girlfriend for almost three years and that they care about each other. The issue arose when his girlfriend brought up her insecurities about her flat chest. He admitted that he prefers bigger chests, which might explain why he often has her face away during intercourse. He was honest but it hurt her feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he was upfront about his preferences, which is important for a relationship. Honesty is usually valued, and he didn't lie. On the other hand, his comment might have been hurtful. The girlfriend felt that the information was new and unaddressed after three years, leading her to feel lied to. \n\nI need to consider if there's a responsibility to address such preferences earlier or if it's acceptable to have different attractions as long as they don't harm the relationship. The author didn't outright reject her, just admitted a preference. However, the way he communicated it might have been insensitive. Maybe he could have acknowledged her insecurities first before stating his preference. Also, the fact that he kept her facing away during sex without explaining for so long might have contributed to her insecurity. \n\nBut ultimately, he was honest. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's hurtful to hear that someone isn't attracted to you in a way that's important to you. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having preferences. It's a complex situation where both parties might need to work on communication. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether honesty overrides the hurt caused. If the community's stance is that honesty is key even if it's painful, then he's not in the wrong. If the community thinks he should have been more considerate in his delivery and timing, then he might be. Given the context, I lean towards B, not in the wrong, because he was honest, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
