We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. They've been together for three years, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The girlfriend asked if he was okay with her chest size, and he admitted he prefers bigger. That upset her because she felt lied to, even though he hadn't mentioned it before.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are honesty in a relationship versus hurting feelings. On one hand, he was honest about his preferences, which is important for a relationship to be open. But on the other hand, bringing up something that's been a source of insecurity for her after she's tried on lingerie and struggled could be seen as insensitive. \n\nHe mentioned that he didn't know how to respond and just told the truth. But maybe he could have been more considerate in how he delivered it. The girlfriend felt hurt and like he lied by not bringing it up earlier. But he didn't know how to approach it before. Is honesty an excuse for hurting someone's feelings? \n\nAlso, the fact that he usually prefers her to face away during intercourse might relate to this, but he didn't mention it until she brought up the topic. So maybe the issue is timing and approach. If he had addressed his feelings earlier, maybe she wouldn't feel like he lied. But he was honest when she asked. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He was honest, but maybe he could have done it in a more supportive way, emphasizing that he still finds her attractive overall. Just stating a preference without framing it in the context of his overall attraction might have been hurtful. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. He wasn't in the wrong for being honest, but maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was honest and he didn't know how else to respond, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that he should have been more considerate. But the main issue is whether he's the asshole. Given that he tried to be honest and didn't anticipate the hurt, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
