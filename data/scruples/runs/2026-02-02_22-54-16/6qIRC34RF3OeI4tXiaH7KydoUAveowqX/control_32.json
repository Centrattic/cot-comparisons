We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy admits he's not attracted to his girlfriend's chest size and prefers bigger ones. He told her honestly, and she felt hurt because he didn't mention it before. They've been together for three years.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The guy says he didn't know how to bring it up before. But maybe he should have addressed it earlier if it was a significant issue. However, he mentioned that he's been honest about preferring bigger chests, but he didn't bring it up because he didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend had insecurities about her body, especially her chest size, which she brought up. He responded truthfully, which might have been hard for her to hear after three years. The problem is that he didn't address it before, leading her to feel like he was being dishonest or holding back. \n\nAlso, the way he approached it might have been abrupt. Instead of just stating his preference, maybe he could have been more considerate of her feelings. But he did say he's not repulsed, just not turned on by her size. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he was honest, which is good, but maybe he should have communicated this earlier. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she felt her insecurities were invalidated. The issue is whether being honest without prior communication is the problem. \n\nIn relationships, if something is affecting your partner's feelings, it's important to address it. Since he didn't bring it up before, even if indirectly, he might be at fault for not being more proactive in supporting her insecurities. But he was honest when asked, so it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nThe key points are honesty vs. timing and method of communication. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she felt lied to. The author's intention was honesty, but the impact was hurtful. So, there's a balance needed between honesty and sensitivity. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be the asshole because he was honest, but he could have handled it better. However, since the girlfriend felt lied to, maybe the author is partially at fault for not addressing it earlier. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was truthful when asked, but didn't communicate it earlier, I think he's partially at fault. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't address it before, leading her to feel lied to. Or B if the answer is that he was honest and not in the wrong. It's tricky. I think the answer is A because the girlfriend's feelings were hurt due to lack of prior communication, even if he was honest when asked. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
