We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves him being honest with his girlfriend about not being attracted to her chest size and preferring bigger ones. He mentioned that she was hurt by his honesty, feeling like he lied because he never brought it up before. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for three years, and he's never mentioned his preference before. Honesty in relationships is important, but timing and how it's delivered also matter. He came forward after she asked directly, which might not be the best approach if it's a sensitive topic.\n\nHe says he's not attracted to her chest but prefers bigger ones. The girlfriend feels invalidated because he didn't mention this earlier. He argues he was being honest, which is valid, but the way he delivered it might have been hurtful. The key here is whether honesty without consideration for the other person's feelings is acceptable. \n\nIn relationships, communication should be open, but it's also important to be mindful of how such truths are shared. If the girlfriend had insecurities about her body, bringing up preferences that could hurt her self-esteem might not be the best approach, especially if it's a new revelation after three years. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers her facing away during intercourse might indicate that he's been managing his preferences to avoid hurting her, which shows some level of consideration. However, not addressing the issue earlier and then being blunt when she brings it up could lead to hurt feelings. \n\nFrom a general perspective, being honest is good, but it's also about how it's communicated. If the delivery isn't considerate, it can be seen as inconsiderate or insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given her insecurities. The man's honesty is honest, but the context and method might make him the asshole here. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his honesty was delivered in a way that hurt his girlfriend, and he didn't consider the emotional impact, especially given her known insecurities.\n"
