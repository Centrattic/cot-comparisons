We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He mentions that she's the first thin person he's been with, and he's more used to women with bigger chests. The girlfriend felt hurt because he didn't mention this before, and she feels lied to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. The author was honest but maybe didn't consider the timing or the way he delivered the message. He said he's not attracted to her chest size, which is a personal preference. But in a long-term relationship (almost 3 years), bringing up such a thing suddenly might be hurtful. Did he consider her feelings? He admitted she was insecure about it, yet he didn't address it before. That's a problem because he knew she had insecurities but didn't support her in that area. Also, avoiding facing her during intercourse because of her chest size seems disrespectful. It's not just about his preference but how he handled it. \n\nThe girlfriend feeling like he lied is valid if he never mentioned this before, even if he was honest now. Relationships require communication, but it's also about how and when you communicate. If he waited until she brought it up and then revealed something that's been an issue for him, that could be seen as not being open. Plus, the fact that he prefers bigger chests but didn't express that earlier might have contributed to her feelings of insecurity. \n\nSo, while it's true that everyone has preferences, the way he handled the situation\u2014being honest but not considering the emotional impact\u2014might make him the asshole. Honesty is important, but so is empathy. He should have addressed her insecurities earlier and not waited until she was already hurt. Also, the fact that he's been avoiding facing her during sex because of her body might not be fair to her. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more supportive and for not communicating his feelings in a way that respects her emotional needs.\n"
