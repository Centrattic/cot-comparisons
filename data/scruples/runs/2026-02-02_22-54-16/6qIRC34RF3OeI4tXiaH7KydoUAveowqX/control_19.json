We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He mentioned he prefers bigger chests, and when she brought up the topic, he was honest but it hurt her feelings.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and honesty in a relationship. The author admits he's being honest but didn't realize how it would affect his girlfriend. She felt he lied because he didn't mention this preference before. The question is whether honesty here justifies the hurt caused.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he never brought up his preferences before and only did so when she asked, maybe the issue is that he didn't consider how to express his feelings without making her feel insecure. He says it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on, which could be seen as a matter of personal preference. However, the way he delivered it might have been harsh without providing enough reassurance or context.\n\nAlso, she's been insecure about her body, so bringing up her insecurities directly without supporting her could be problematic. Even if it's the truth, the timing and method of communication might matter more. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences in a more supportive way, emphasizing that he's attracted to her overall but has personal preferences. But since he's honest and the preferences are his, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But he did hurt her feelings, so he might need to take responsibility for that.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether honesty is a valid defense here. If he's truthful but didn't consider her feelings, he's not completely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, in relationships, sometimes honesty isn't enough if it's delivered without empathy. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he was honest, but there's a gray area. Wait, but some people might argue that he should have managed his feelings better or addressed them earlier. The fact that she felt lied to because he didn't mention it before complicates things. Maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier, leading her to feel she was inadequate. So maybe A. But others might say it's his preference and he's not obligated to fake attraction. Hmm. I'm torn between A and B here. Need to decide based on typical relationship advice.\n"
