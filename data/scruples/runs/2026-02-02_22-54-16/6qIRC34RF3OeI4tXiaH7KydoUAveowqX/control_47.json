We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 3-year relationship where the guy isn't attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. He's honest with her, but she's hurt and feels lied to because he never mentioned it before. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The key here is that the guy waited until after three years to bring up a preference he had. That seems like a problem because in a healthy relationship, partners should communicate their needs and boundaries openly. If he's been choosing positions where she's facing away, that's a red flag. It shows he's been avoiding the issue instead of addressing it directly and supporting her insecurities.\n\nThen there's the impact of his honesty. While honesty is important, the way and timing matter. Bringing up an issue after the fact, especially when it's something the partner is already insecure about, can be hurtful. The girlfriend felt like he lied because he never addressed it before, which is valid. He should have communicated his preferences earlier, not waited until she brought it up.\n\nAlso, the fact that he only mentioned it after she tried on lingerie and was already in a mental funk shows a lack of emotional intelligence. He didn't consider how his honesty would affect her at that moment. Relationships require not just honesty but also empathy and sensitivity. \n\nOn the other hand, he is being honest about his attractions. However, attraction can coexist with respecting a partner's insecurities. The problem is that he didn't address his own feelings proactively. Instead, he let her insecurities go unaddressed, which isn't supportive. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy's actions\u2014being honest but not in a timely or empathetic manner\u2014likely made his girlfriend feel unaccepted. The wrong here isn't about the attraction itself but the communication around it. So, the answer is A.\n"
