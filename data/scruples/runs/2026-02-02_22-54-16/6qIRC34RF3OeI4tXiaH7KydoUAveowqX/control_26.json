We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about not being attracted to their girlfriend's body is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend admitting his preference for a larger chest size, which upsets his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for three years. The girlfriend has always been insecure about her flat chest, and the boyfriend didn't mention this preference before. He only addressed it when she brought it up after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. \n\nThe key points here are communication and hurt feelings. The boyfriend was honest, but honesty alone doesn't absolve the hurt caused. The girlfriend felt lied to because the issue wasn't discussed earlier. In a long-term relationship, partners usually talk about such preferences to avoid hurt later. The boyfriend's admission, while honest, might have been delivered without enough sensitivity, especially since he knew about her insecurities.\n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers facing away during intercourse due to her chest size suggests that this preference affects their intimacy. Not discussing this earlier could be seen as neglecting to address her feelings proactively. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014feeling hurt and going home\u2014shows the impact of his words.\n\nSo, while the boyfriend's intention was to be truthful, the timing and lack of prior communication play a role. The question is whether honesty justifies the hurt caused. In relationships, how and when something is communicated matters. The boyfriend didn't consider that his honesty might harm her self-esteem, especially since he was aware of her insecurities.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being wrong (A) because he didn't communicate his preferences in a way that was considerate of his partner's feelings, leading to emotional harm. Honesty is important, but it should be balanced with empathy and timing.\n"
