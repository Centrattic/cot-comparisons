We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The situation is that the author is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with women who have bigger chests. She asked him if he was okay with her flat chest, and he told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones. She was hurt and felt lied to because he hadn't mentioned this before.\n\nSo, the main points here are honesty in a relationship versus the impact of that honesty. The author was honest, which is usually a positive trait. However, the way he delivered the information might not have been considerate enough. He didn't address her insecurities in a supportive way. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have validated her feelings first. For example, acknowledging that she's insecure and that he finds her attractive overall, but also being honest about his preferences. \n\nThe girlfriend felt hurt because her insecurities were hurt. The author didn't realize that his honesty might trigger her self-esteem issues. In relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how you communicate that honesty. There's a balance between being truthful and being kind. The author might have been honest, but he didn't consider the emotional impact of his words. \n\nAnother angle is whether not being attracted to certain physical features is a valid reason for the author's feelings. People have different attractions, and it's natural. However, the problem arises when one's honesty causes emotional harm without necessary consideration. The author didn't lie; he was truthful. But maybe he should have approached the conversation differently, perhaps choosing a better time or providing reassurance about her overall attractiveness.\n\nThe girlfriend had been trying on lingerie and was already feeling insecure, so the timing of the conversation might have been poor. The author didn't take that into account, leading to her feeling hurt. Additionally, by not discussing this earlier, she might have felt like he wasn't being open with her, hence the feeling of being lied to.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he was honest, but he could have handled the situation better. The key here is communication style and emotional intelligence. The answer hinges on whether honesty is an excuse for not being considerate. If the author had been honest in a way that supported her self-esteem, maybe the outcome would have been different. But as it stands, his honesty might have been blunt and hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because while honesty is important, the manner in which it was delivered and the lack of consideration for her feelings contributed to her emotional pain. Therefore, B (the author is not in the wrong) might not be the correct answer. Wait, but the user initially thought the author is not in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe there's a nuance here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was being honest, even if it hurt, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might argue that in a long-term relationship, one should be more mindful of how such honesty affects the other person. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But given the context, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his honesty in a way that protected her feelings, leading to her feeling hurt and lied to. Alternatively, some might say B because he was truthful, and people have different attractions. But the key here is whether his actions were considerate enough. Since he didn't consider her insecurities and delivered the truth without support, the answer is A.\n"
