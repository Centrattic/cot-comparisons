We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is honest about his preferences. He's been with his girlfriend for three years, and this is the first time he's been with someone thin. She brought up the issue because she's insecure about her chest size. He told her the truth that he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt. She felt like he lied because he didn't mention this before.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, honesty is important in a relationship, but so is sensitivity. The author was honest, but maybe he didn't consider how his words would affect her. He didn't lie, but withholding such a preference for three years might have been an issue. However, he didn't know how to express it before she brought it up. On the other hand, she might have expected him to communicate his preferences earlier if they were affecting his attraction. But since he didn't bring it up, maybe it's not his fault. It's a common issue in relationships where people have different body types and preferences. The problem here is more about communication rather than the preference itself. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The answer depends on whether honesty is more important than the impact on her feelings. But since he was truthful, maybe he's not the asshole here.\n"
