We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 3-year relationship where the author isn't attracted to his girlfriend's flat chest, which is different from his usual preference for bigger chests. The key points here are communication, honesty, and the emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend brought up the topic herself. She was insecure about her chest size and had been trying on lingerie, which made her feel insecure. Then he told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests. She felt hurt and thought he lied because he didn't bring it up before.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, honesty is important. However, the way he delivered the truth might have been insensitive. The girlfriend was already in a vulnerable state when she asked the question. Instead of directly saying he prefers bigger chests, maybe he could have acknowledged her feelings first, expressed his preference gently, and reaffirmed his affection for her despite that difference. \n\nThe fact that he didn't bring this up before might have led to her feeling like he wasn't being transparent. In a long-term relationship, certain preferences can affect how partners view each other, so maybe there's an expectation that such things are discussed earlier. However, the girlfriend also has a responsibility to communicate her insecurities more openly instead of waiting for a specific question. \n\nBut in this case, the author's response was direct and possibly hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the comment about preferring bigger breasts and facing away during sex could make her feel unattractive. The author might not be in the wrong for being honest, but the way he handled the conversation was probably the issue. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether honesty is an excuse for potential insensitivity. Since the girlfriend felt lied to, even if the author was being honest, the timing and delivery matter. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being more considerate in his communication, even if the content was truthful.\n"
