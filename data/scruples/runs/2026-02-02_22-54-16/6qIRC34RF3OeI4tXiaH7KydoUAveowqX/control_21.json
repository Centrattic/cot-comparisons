We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is that he's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him about her chest size, and he told her he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt and thinks he lied because he never mentioned it before.\n\nHmm. The key points here are honesty in a relationship and communication. The author says he's being honest, but the girlfriend is hurt because he didn't bring it up before. In relationships, communication is key. If he hasn't mentioned his preferences before, bringing it up now might come as a surprise. But is it wrong to be honest? Well, the way he delivered it might have been harsh. He could have approached it more gently, maybe in a non-sexual context, to avoid hurting her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been insecure about her body and he didn't address it before might mean he didn't support her enough. Maybe he should have reassured her about her attractiveness in other ways, not just focusing on one aspect. On the other hand, he's also being honest about his preferences, which is important for both partners to know. But timing and delivery matter. If he waited until she brought up the insecurity, maybe he should have been more supportive instead of just stating his preference.\n\nThe girlfriend feeling lied to suggests there's a breach of trust. Even if he's honest, not addressing it before might have led her to believe he was okay with it. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not communicating this earlier. However, being honest about preferences can be necessary for the relationship. It's a tricky balance. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his feelings earlier, leading to hurt feelings. But if the question is about whether it's wrong to have preferences, then maybe B. But given the context of how it was handled, A seems more likely.\n"
