We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the guy is wondering if he's the asshole for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with people who have bigger chests. The situation started when they were watching Netflix, and she asked if he was okay with her flat chest. She mentioned she was trying on lingerie that didn't fit, which made her feel insecure.\n\nHe told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that she doesn't turn him on in that way. She felt hurt, thought he was lying, and left. Now he's asking if he's wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, communication is key in relationships, right? But he waited three years to bring this up. That seems like a long time. If he had concerns about attraction, even if it's about body image, he should have addressed them earlier. Maybe she felt blindsided because he never mentioned it before. Also, the way he brought it up might have been hurtful. Instead of being supportive, he confirmed her insecurities rather than reassuring her. \n\nOn the other hand, he might be honest about his preferences, but honesty shouldn't come at the expense of her feelings if there's a better way to handle it. Maybe he could have approached it differently, like expressing that he's attracted to her in other ways or that his preferences don't define her worth. But he didn't. He focused on what he doesn't like, which probably made her feel worse. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and appreciated. If he can't find attraction in her body, that's a problem they need to work on together. Maybe therapy or open conversations could help. But just being honest without considering her feelings might be the issue here. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings in a supportive way and waited too long to address it, causing her pain.\n"
