We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him if he was okay with her flat chest after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger breasts, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The author admits he's never brought up his preferences before. In a long-term relationship, it's important to communicate needs and feelings, but timing and context matter. Did he bring this up in a hurtful way? He says he told her he's honest and didn't know what else to say. But bringing up a preference that she wasn't aware of can be damaging if it's something she's insecure about.\n\nSecond, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She feels lied to because he didn't mention this before. People often expect their partners to express such feelings, especially if they're affecting the relationship. The fact that he prefers a different body type isn't a lie, but not addressing it sooner could contribute to her insecurity.\n\nThird, his actions (preferring her to face away during sex) might have been a silent signal, but he didn't address it openly. Now, by being honest, he might have caused pain, but she needed to know. However, the way he delivered it could be improved. Maybe he should have acknowledged her feelings more and discussed how to move forward rather than just stating his preference.\n\nAlso, considering emotional support, partners should uplift each other. If she's insecure about her body, the partner should encourage and reassure her. The author's honesty might be necessary, but it's possible he didn't handle it with enough empathy. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but it's equally vital to consider how and when to share such truths. The author might not be in the wrong for being honest, but he could have approached it more sensitively. However, the core issue is whether his honesty was a betrayal of trust or a necessary communication. Since he was honest and didn't lie, maybe he's not the asshole. But the way he handled it without prior discussion could be problematic. \n\nI think the key here is that he was honest, which is good, but maybe he should have addressed his preferences earlier to avoid hurting her. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's honesty isn't malicious. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he needs to work on communication strategies to support her feelings.\n"
