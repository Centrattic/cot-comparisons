We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The situation is that the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest, and he admitted he prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt, thinking he lied about not caring before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Honesty is important, but timing and sensitivity matter too. The author was honest, which is good, but maybe the way he approached it was harsh. He didn't address her insecurities directly, just stated his preference without validating her feelings. That might have made her feel rejected.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend had been insecure about this for a while. If the author never addressed her insecurities before, it's possible he wasn't showing enough support. Now, when she brings it up, being brutally honest without reassurance could be hurtful. Even if it's the truth, it's how it's delivered. Maybe he should have balanced his honesty with affirming her attractiveness in other ways.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that he prefers bigger chests, but he didn't frame it as a personal preference rather than a criticism of her. If he had said, \"I have a preference, but I still find you attractive in so many other ways,\" that might have been better. Instead, he might have made her feel like her body isn't good enough.\n\nAlso, the fact that he uses her facing away as a way to avoid her chest during sex could imply that he's avoiding intimacy because of her body, which isn't ideal. It might make her feel like she's not being accepted as she is.\n\nSo, while honesty is important, the manner in which he communicated his preference and the lack of support for her insecurities might mean he's in the wrong. Relationships require not just honesty but also empathy and validation. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with enough care and consideration for her feelings.\n"
