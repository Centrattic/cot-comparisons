We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's been with his girlfriend for three years and that she's the first thin person he's been with. She asked him directly about her chest, which she's insecure about. He was honest and said he prefers bigger chests, which made her feel hurt. She felt lied to because he didn't mention this before. \n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. Communication in relationships is key. If he never brought up his preferences before, even if they were honest, it might have come as a shock to her. She was trying to open up about her insecurities, and his response was a bit of a blow. But is honesty always the best policy here? \n\nOn one hand, he's being truthful, which is important. But on the other hand, the way he delivered it might have been hurtful. He didn't mention his preference before, so bringing it up now could feel like a betrayal. Also, he uses her body type as a reason for his preference, which might affect her self-esteem. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his feelings earlier, even if they're true, he might have contributed to her insecurities. The fact that he didn't address her concerns when she brought them up could be a problem. But he didn't lie; he was honest. However, honesty without consideration can be harmful. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel comfortable. If he's not attracted to her body, it's important to communicate that in a supportive way, not just drop it when she's already vulnerable. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. \n\nBut the key point here is that he didn't mention his preference before, even though she had insecurities. By not addressing it earlier, he didn't support her. Now, when she brings it up, his response is honest but potentially damaging. So maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't support her and didn't communicate his feelings in a way that respects her feelings. \n\nAlternatively, if he's being honest and it's not a lie, then he's not in the wrong. But the way he handled the conversation is problematic. The question is whether he's the asshole. In the AITA context, being the asshole usually means doing something that's hurtful without valid reason. Here, his honesty might be valid, but the impact on her feelings is significant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he is the asshole) because he didn't support her and his honesty was delivered in a way that hurt her, especially when she was already vulnerable. But some might say B because he's not lying. However, in the context of the relationship, his failure to communicate his feelings earlier and the hurt caused by his response might make him the asshole.\n"
