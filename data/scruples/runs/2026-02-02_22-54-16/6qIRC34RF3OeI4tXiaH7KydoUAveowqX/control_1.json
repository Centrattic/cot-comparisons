We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being attracted to women with bigger chests. They were watching Netflix, and she asked if he was okay with her flat chest because she's insecure about it. He admitted he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. He also mentioned that's why he likes her to face away during sex. She got hurt, felt lied to, and left. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but the way it's delivered matters. The author waited 3 years to bring this up. Why didn't he address it earlier? If this was a significant issue, especially affecting his sexual preferences, not bringing it up could hurt her feelings. She might have felt blindsided.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of respect and empathy. The girlfriend had been insecure about her body, and the author's blunt honesty without considering her feelings could come off as dismissive. Instead of just stating his preference, he could have acknowledged her insecurities first and then expressed his feelings in a more supportive way. Maybe he could have reassured her that he finds other aspects attractive, not just her chest size.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used an alt account because his family follows his primary suggests he might not want public judgment, but that's not directly relevant. The key is whether his actions were hurtful. His girlfriend felt hurt and lied to, implying that he didn't communicate his preferences earlier. Honesty is good, but timing and delivery are crucial. Waiting until after three years and bringing it up in a way that makes her feel inadequate could be seen as the problem.\n\nAnother angle: attraction can vary, and it's okay to have preferences. But in a long-term relationship, if a partner's insecurity is known, addressing it with care is important. The author's response was direct but may lack the emotional support she needs. He didn't validate her feelings enough before stating his own. So, the hurt came from him not considering how his words would affect her, even if he was honest.\n\nIs there any justification? He was honest, which is a positive trait, but maybe not the right time or method. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't address it earlier, that's a problem. Also, the way he explained his preference (facing away during sex) might imply he's not trying to accommodate her. He should have found a balance between honesty and empathy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his feelings constructively and withheld them for a long time, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
