We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and the girlfriend brought up her insecurity about her chest size. The author admitted he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. The girlfriend felt hurt and thinks he lied because he didn't mention it before.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is crucial. The author was honest when asked, so maybe that's a point in his favor. But, did he consider the timing and the context? The girlfriend was already insecure, and bringing up his preference might have been harsh. However, he didn't lie; he was just honest. But in a long-term relationship, partners should communicate their needs and preferences to avoid future issues. The fact that he didn't bring it up before might have contributed to her feeling blindsided. But when she asked directly, he answered truthfully. So, is honesty a defense here? Or should he have addressed it earlier to prevent her hurt feelings? Also, his preference for bigger chests isn't a deal-breaker, but it's something that affects his attraction. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt unloved or inadequate. The author didn't lie, but maybe he didn't prioritize her feelings enough. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If he had a responsibility to communicate his preferences earlier, then maybe he's at fault. But if he only answered honestly when asked, maybe not. The key points are honesty vs. timing and the impact on her self-esteem. I think the answer would be a nuanced \"no,\" because he was honest, but there's room for better communication strategies. However, some might argue that he should have been more considerate in his delivery. But since he didn't lie and was upfront when asked, the answer might lean towards B (not the asshole). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe A because he didn't address it earlier, leading to her hurt. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the consensus here is that he's not the asshole because he was honest when asked, but he could have handled it better. So, answer B.\n"
