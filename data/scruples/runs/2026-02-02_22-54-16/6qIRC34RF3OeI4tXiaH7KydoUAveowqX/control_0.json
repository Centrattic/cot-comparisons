We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's thin, petite, and has a flat chest, which he mentions is the first time he's been with someone like that. Most of the previous partners he's had were \"bigger in the good places,\" specifically mentioning a preference for bigger chest sizes. \n\nThe issue started when the girlfriend asked if he was okay with her flat chest. She's been insecure about it, especially after trying on lingerie that didn't fit. The author told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. He clarified that it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on either. He also mentioned that's why he usually prefers her facing away during sex. After he said this, she left and felt hurt. She thought he lied because he didn't mention this before, even though he claims he didn't know what to say.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and communication. In a long-term relationship, communication is key, especially when it comes to things that affect both partners. The author waited three years to bring up his preference for a bigger chest. That seems like a long time, especially since his girlfriend has been insecure about her body. By not discussing this earlier, he might have contributed to her insecurity by not affirming her in a way that she needed. \n\nHowever, he also states that he's being honest. He didn't mean to hurt her, but he felt it was important to be truthful. The problem here is that honesty can sometimes be harsh, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body image. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she might feel that her self-esteem issues could have been addressed earlier if he had shared his perspective. \n\nAnother angle is the fact that physical attraction can vary, and it's not necessarily the author's fault that he's attracted to different body types. But in a committed relationship, how you communicate your preferences is important. If his preferences were affecting the intimacy or dynamics in a way that caused his partner pain, then it's his responsibility to address it in a more supportive manner. \n\nThe girlfriend's insecurity is something she's had to deal with, and the author's response might have triggered her. Even if he didn't bring it up before, he could have reassured her in other ways or chosen a better time to discuss it. The fact that he didn't mention it for three years suggests that maybe he should have considered how his comments would affect her. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also possible that he didn't realize the extent of her insecurity. She asked him directly, so he felt compelled to answer honestly. But even so, there's a way to be honest while still being kind and supportive. Maybe he could have acknowledged her feelings and reassured her that her self-worth isn't tied to her chest size, while also expressing his preferences. \n\nIn terms of relationship norms, partners are expected to support each other's insecurities. If one partner has a preference that's causing the other distress, it's important to handle it with care. The author's approach might have been too direct without enough sensitivity. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for being honest about his preferences, but he might have handled the situation poorly by not addressing it earlier and not considering the emotional impact on his girlfriend. However, the key point is that he didn't lie; he just didn't communicate his feelings in a way that supported her emotional needs. \n\nIn many cases, being honest is the right thing to do, but it's also about how the honesty is delivered and the context in which it's shared. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because of the timing and the way he communicated his preference, which caused hurt feelings in a long-term partner. But there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because he was honest and it's not his fault that he has different preferences. \n\nI need to decide which is more important: the honesty or the communication timing and sensitivity. Given that relationships require both honesty and sensitivity, and since he didn't address it earlier despite her known insecurities, it's likely that he is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
