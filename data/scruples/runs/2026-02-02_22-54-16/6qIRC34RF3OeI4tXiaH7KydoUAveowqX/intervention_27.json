We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation involves the OP not being attracted to their girlfriend's chest size, which is different from his past partners. The girlfriend felt hurt because he didn't mention this preference before, leading her to think he lied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The OP is honest about his preferences. He mentions that he prefers bigger chests, which he's been with in the past. The girlfriend had insecurities about her flat chest, leading her to ask if he's okay with it. The OP's response was honest, which made her feel hurt and like he lied. But he didn't lie; he just hadn't discussed it before. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The OP didn't hide his preference until she asked. He might not have considered how his honesty would affect her. The girlfriend's feelings of being lied about come from the fact that he didn't bring this up earlier. However, if he didn't know how to approach it before, maybe he's not at fault for being honest when asked. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have addressed her insecurities sooner, even if it wasn't in the same way. But her bringing up the topic first might absolve him of some responsibility. The key here is whether honesty in this context is expected. Since she asked directly, his answer is truthful.\n\nAnother angle: attractiveness is subjective. The OP isn't repelled by her, just not attracted to her chest size. That's a personal preference. The problem arises from the timing and the impact of his honesty. However, if he's being truthful when asked, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid due to her insecurities, but the OP's honesty is also valid.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he was honest when asked, but maybe there's a nuance. But according to the question's structure, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and based on the analysis, I agree. The fault isn't on the OP for being honest, even if it hurt her. The real issue might be about communication and addressing insecurities before the conversation came up.\n"
