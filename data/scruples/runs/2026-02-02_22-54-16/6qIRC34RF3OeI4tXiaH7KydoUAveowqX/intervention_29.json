We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy has been dating his girlfriend for almost three years. She's the first thin person he's been with, while he's usually been with bigger girls. The problem came up when she asked if he's okay with her flat chest. He admitted he prefers bigger chests and that he doesn't find her chest size attractive, even though he said it's not a turn-off. This made her feel hurt, leading her to leave and later text him that he lied. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, honesty, and how the information was delivered. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if others agree.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The man was honest about his preferences, but the timing and context might matter. The girlfriend had been insecure and tried on lingerie that didn't fit, which triggered her insecurity. The guy hadn't mentioned his preference before, which made her feel like he was hiding the truth. \n\nHonesty is good, but sometimes how you deliver the truth matters. By not bringing it up before, he might have contributed to her feelings of insecurity. Also, preferring a different body type isn't inherently wrong, but if it's affecting the relationship and causing hurt, it's a problem that needs addressing. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being truthful about his preferences, he has a point. But if his honesty was delivered in a way that hurt her without prior discussion, maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the fact that he made an effort to communicate honestly suggests he's trying to be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend's insecurities were something they should have discussed earlier, maybe both parties have some responsibility. But the immediate judgment here is that the guy is being truthful and not trying to deceive. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that he should have communicated his preferences earlier instead of waiting for her to bring it up. However, since he was honest when asked, it's hard to say he's in the wrong for being truthful. The main issue is the impact of his honesty on her feelings. Still, honesty is generally seen as a positive trait in relationships. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
