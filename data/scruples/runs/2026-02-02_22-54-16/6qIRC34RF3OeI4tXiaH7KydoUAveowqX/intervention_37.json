We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. He's been honest with her, but she's hurt and feels lied to because he didn't mention this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been dating for three years, and he's had previous relationships with women who had different body types. The girlfriend is insecure about her chest size, which is a known issue she's had. He didn't bring up his preferences before, and when she asked, he was honest about it. Now she's upset because he didn't express this earlier, feeling like he lied by omission.\n\nIs honesty a defense here? In relationships, communication is key. He might not be in the wrong for being honest, but maybe the timing or the way he communicated it was hurtful. He said it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on. She took it as a criticism. The fact that he prefers a bigger chest and has been facing the other way during sex suggests that his preferences were influencing his behavior, which he hadn't addressed.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. He was honest, which is generally a good practice in relationships. However, he didn't address her insecurities proactively. By not discussing this earlier, maybe he contributed to her feeling unattractive. On the other hand, he might not have realized how much this was affecting her. \n\nIn terms of AITA standards, sometimes honesty without consideration can be seen as an asshole move. The key is whether his honesty was delivered in a way that was respectful and considerate of her feelings. He did mention that it's not a turn-off, which is important. But the fact that he didn't bring this up before when she was already struggling with body image issues could mean he's responsible for not addressing it earlier. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe partially. He's honest but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, since he was truthful when asked, some might argue he's not in the wrong. Others might say that not being attracted to her body in a way that affects their intimacy could be a problem. The fact that he prefers a different body type is personal, but if it's affecting their relationship, communication is needed. \n\nI think the answer is B, not in the wrong, because he was honest when asked. However, there's room for improvement in how he communicates and addresses her insecurities proactively. The main issue is the lack of prior communication, but since he was truthful, it's a B.\n"
