We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not being attracted to their girlfriend's chest size. They've been in a 3-year relationship, and the girlfriend is petite with a flat chest, which the author admits is the first time they've been with someone like that. The girlfriend brought up the topic after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. The author was honest but didn't realize how hurtful it was.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and the impact of their words. The author was honest, which is good, but maybe they didn't consider how their honesty would affect their partner. The girlfriend felt lied about because the author hadn't mentioned this before. Even if it's the truth, not discussing such things can lead to hurt feelings. In relationships, how you communicate is as important as the content. The author could have approached the topic more sensitively, perhaps acknowledging her insecurities first before stating their preference. Also, the fact that the author prefers facing away during sex might relate to this, but it's not the main issue here. The main issue is the sudden honesty leading to emotional pain. So, while the author isn't malicious, their approach might be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards them being in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy, even if their intent was honesty.\n"
