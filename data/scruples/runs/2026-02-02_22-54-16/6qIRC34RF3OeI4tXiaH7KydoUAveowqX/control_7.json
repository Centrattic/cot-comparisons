We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 3-year relationship where the guy is not attracted to his girlfriend's chest size. He admitted his preference for bigger chests, which upset her because she was already insecure about that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The guy didn't bring up this issue before, even though it's a significant aspect of attraction. By not discussing it earlier, he might have contributed to her feeling hurt. But he did finally tell her the truth, which shows honesty.\n\nNext, his girlfriend's reaction makes sense because she was already insecure. Not mentioning his preference over three years could be seen as not supporting her self-esteem. However, he didn't lie; he was honest when she asked. \n\nThe key here is whether withholding a preference that affects attraction is wrong. In relationships, partners usually expect to be attracted to each other, but preferences can exist. The guy's choice to not discuss it sooner might have been to avoid hurting her, but when she asked, he chose honesty. \n\nBut did he have to be so direct? Maybe a more supportive way to express his preference could have helped her feel better. However, the situation also shows that their physical intimacy had a pattern (her facing away), which she noticed. He didn't hide it, but he didn't address it until she brought it up.\n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether not discussing it earlier is a fault. Since he was honest when asked and didn't lie, maybe he's not the asshole. But the fact that he didn't address her insecurities proactively might be a point against him. However, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because he was truthful and didn't make her feel bad on purpose. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where both have room for improvement. However, based on the options given, the best choice is B.\n"
