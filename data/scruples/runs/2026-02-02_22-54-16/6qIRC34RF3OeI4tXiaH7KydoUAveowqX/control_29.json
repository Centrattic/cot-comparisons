We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend. The girlfriend is thin, petite, and has a flat chest, which is different from the guy's usual preference for bigger sizes. The girlfriend asked if he's okay with her chest size because she's insecure. He told her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. She felt hurt, thought he lied because he hadn't mentioned this before, and left. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The guy didn't bring up his preferences before, even though they've been together for a long time. The girlfriend had been trying on lingerie and was already insecure. By not addressing this before, he might have contributed to her insecurities. When she asked, he gave an honest answer, but maybe the timing or the way he communicated it was hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, partners often adjust their preferences or become more accepting over time. The guy admitting his preference could be seen as honest, but if he hasn't acted on it or made her feel unattractive, maybe he should have approached it differently. However, the girlfriend bringing up her insecurities first might mean he's justified in responding honestly. But since he didn't mention this before, even if it's true, it could feel like a betrayal. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, honesty is important, but on the other, how and when you share such information matters. If he's been consistently not complimenting her in that area and it's affecting her self-esteem, then he should have addressed it earlier. By bringing it up only when she asked, it might have come as a surprise and hurt her more than if he had communicated his feelings earlier. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers her to face away during intercourse because of her chest size shows that his preference is affecting their intimacy. That's a significant issue. Maybe he should have discussed it sooner to work on solutions, like focusing on other aspects of their relationship or ways to make her feel valued. \n\nSo, the guy's honesty is valid, but the way he handled it might be the problem. The girlfriend felt lied to because the issue wasn't discussed before. In a long-term relationship, partners should feel comfortable discussing their preferences to avoid hurt. Since he didn't bring it up earlier, even if it's true, it's possible he's in the wrong for not being proactive about addressing her insecurities and finding a way to make her feel attractive beyond just his preferences.\n"
