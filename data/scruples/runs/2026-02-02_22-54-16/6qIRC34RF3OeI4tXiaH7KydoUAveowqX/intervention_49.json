We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has been in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's the first thin person he's been with, and he's used to being with people with bigger chests. His girlfriend asked him if he was okay with her flat chest because she's insecure about it. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger ones, which made her feel hurt and led to her leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in the relationship and how the information was delivered. On one hand, the author was honest, which is important in a relationship. But on the other hand, his honesty might have been delivered in a way that was hurtful and unexpected. The girlfriend had been insecure for a while and didn't know he felt that way, which made her feel like he lied. \n\nI should consider communication styles. Maybe the author should have been more sensitive in his approach. Instead of just stating a preference, he could have acknowledged her feelings and reassured her while expressing his own. Also, maybe he could have talked about it before, especially since she had mentioned her insecurities before. The fact that he didn't bring it up earlier might make it seem like he's been holding back, which could hurt her more.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's been struggling with self-esteem issues related to her body. The author's statement might have triggered those feelings again. Even if his preference is genuine, the way he communicated it without considering her emotional state could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut the author's intention was honesty, which is a positive trait. However, the delivery and timing mattered. The question is whether honesty absolves him of responsibility for the hurt caused. In relationships, how you communicate is as important as what you say. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he prefers facing away during intercourse. That could imply that he's been avoiding intimacy in a way that might not have been discussed before, which adds to the hurt. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't mention it before, even though he didn't lie. It's about unmet expectations and the impact of not addressing her insecurities.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because his honesty was delivered without considering his partner's feelings and history. He should have been more empathetic and maybe found a better way to express his preferences without hurting her. But some might argue that honesty is necessary, hence the debate. However, in this context, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the hurt caused and the lack of sensitivity in communication.\n"
