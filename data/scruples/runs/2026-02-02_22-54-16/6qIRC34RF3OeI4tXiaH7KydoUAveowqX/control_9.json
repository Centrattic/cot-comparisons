We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not being attracted to their girlfriend's body type, specifically her flat chest. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person they've been with. The girlfriend asked if he was okay with her chest size because she's been insecure about it. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests, which upset her.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here. First, the author is being honest about his preferences. But is honesty an excuse for causing hurt? Communication in relationships is important, but how and when you communicate certain things matters. The girlfriend was clearly insecure about this, and the author hadn't mentioned it before. Maybe he could have approached it differently, like reassuring her first before stating his preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that he made an account to ask this suggests he's concerned about the impact of his words. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't bring it up earlier. Maybe he should have addressed her insecurities in a more supportive way instead of just stating his preference. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's not lying. He's being honest about his attraction, which is a valid feeling. However, in relationships, especially long-term ones, partners have expectations about how to handle such topics. If she was already insecure, bringing up his preference without more support could be seen as hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think it's a nuanced situation. The author's honesty is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been hurtful. Since the girlfriend was already insecure and he didn't consider her feelings, maybe he should have handled it more delicately. But he's not wrong for having preferences. However, in a relationship, being considerate is key. So maybe he is in the wrong because he hurt her feelings unnecessarily. But then again, he's not obligated to lie about his attractions. Hmm. \n\nI think the key here is that he didn't consider her feelings when bringing it up. He could have reassured her more, instead of just stating his preference. So, while his feelings are valid, the way he communicated them was unkind. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being more considerate in his response. So the answer would be A.\n"
