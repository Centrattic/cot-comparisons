We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about attraction to their girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. The author mentions that she's the first thin person he's been with, and he's not attracted to her flat chest. He prefers bigger chests. He told her honestly that he's not into her chest size, which upset her because she felt lied to since he never mentioned it before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The author didn't bring up this issue before, even though it's a significant aspect of their physical relationship. He admitted he didn't know what to say and was being honest. But the girlfriend was hurt because she felt she wasn't good enough and that he hadn't communicated his preferences, which affected their intimacy (like him preferring her to face away during sex). \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If there are preferences or attractions that affect the relationship, especially ones that might impact the partner's self-esteem, it's important to address them. The author didn't communicate this before, leading to hurt feelings. Even if he's honest, the timing and context matter. The girlfriend felt insecure about her body, and bringing up this preference after she already had self-esteem issues might have been damaging.\n\nAlso, the fact that he mentioned preferring her to face away during intercourse implies that his lack of attraction was affecting their physical relationship. Not addressing this earlier could have led to her feeling unattractive and unloved. The key here is whether honesty without prior communication is justified. Sometimes being honest can be necessary, but it's also about how and when you communicate it, especially if it's something that could hurt the other person. \n\nThe author's intention was to be truthful, but the impact was negative. The girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't bring it up before. So, the question is whether the author should have communicated his preferences earlier or handled it more sensitively. In many cases, partners are expected to communicate their needs and feelings to maintain a healthy relationship. The author's lack of prior communication and the way he revealed it might have caused unnecessary hurt. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate his feelings effectively and in a timely manner, leading to emotional harm to his girlfriend.\n"
