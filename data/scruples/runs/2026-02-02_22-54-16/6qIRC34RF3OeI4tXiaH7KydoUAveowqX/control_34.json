We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The girlfriend was insecure about her flat chest and asked him about it. He told her honestly that he prefers bigger chests and that it's why he prefers her facing away during sex. She felt hurt because he hadn't mentioned this before and felt like he lied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important, but timing and sensitivity matter. He waited three years to mention a preference that affects their intimacy. That could be seen as a problem because it's not something you hold back for such a long time if it's affecting the relationship. \n\nThen there's the aspect of self-esteem. She was already insecure about her body, and bringing up this preference might have exacerbated her feelings. Even if he's honest, the way he communicates it could be hurtful. Maybe he should have expressed his feelings earlier in a more supportive way, emphasizing that he still finds her attractive despite his preference.\n\nHowever, he's also being honest about his preferences. People have different attractions, and it's valid to have preferences. The issue here seems to be that the information came as a surprise, and it wasn't handled carefully. The key point is whether he should have communicated this earlier or framed it in a way that affirms her attractiveness regardless of her chest size.\n\nAlso, the fact that he faces away during sex because of this preference might have already given her cues that something was different. If he didn't address it, she might have felt confused or unattractive without knowing why. So, the withholding of information over three years could be a factor in her feeling lied to.\n\nIn terms of the rules of the platform (AITA), the community often values considering both parties' perspectives. The author's intention was to be honest, but the impact on the girlfriend was hurtful. The question is whether the author's honesty justifies the hurt caused, especially when it could have been addressed earlier with more sensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating this earlier and for not being more mindful of his girlfriend's insecurities. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
