We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy admitting he's not attracted to his girlfriend's chest size and preferring bigger ones. He's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. She brought up the topic, and he was honest with her, which upset her.\n\nHmm. So, the guy says he's always been with bigger girls and prefers bigger chests. When she asked if he's okay with her flat chest, he told her the truth. She felt hurt because he didn't mention that before. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I should consider communication in relationships. Being honest is important, but timing and delivery matter. The guy didn't lie; he just hadn't mentioned his preference before. But the girl felt like he was hiding something. Maybe he could have been more proactive in reassuring her instead of just stating his preference. \n\nBut she brought up the topic first. She was insecure and asked why he never commented on her chest. He was honest, which might have hurt her feelings. However, lying would be worse. So, is he in the wrong for being honest, or is she in the wrong for feeling that way? \n\nRelationship dynamics vary. If her insecurity is a big issue, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But he didn't know she felt that way until she asked. He might have thought it wasn't a problem since she wasn't bringing it up. \n\nAlso, the guy's honesty might be necessary for her to know his feelings, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the way he delivered it could have been more sensitive. He said he's not attracted to her chest size, which might make her feel unattractive. Maybe he should have framed it differently, emphasizing that he loves her regardless but still has preferences. \n\nBut the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of right or wrong, honesty isn't wrong, but maybe the approach could have been better. However, the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B). If the answer is B, meaning not in the wrong, because he was truthful and didn't lie. But if the answer is A, maybe because he didn't consider her feelings enough. \n\nI think in most cases, honesty is expected, even if it's hard. So the author isn't in the wrong for being honest. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
