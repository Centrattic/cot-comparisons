We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is in a 3-year relationship and their girlfriend is thin with a flat chest. The author has been with bigger girls before who had bigger chests, and they admit they prefer bigger ones. The girlfriend brought up her insecurity about her chest size during a Netflix night, and when the author told her the truth, she felt hurt and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in a relationship. The girlfriend was trying to open up about her insecurities, which is a vulnerable moment. The author's response was honest but hurtful. In relationships, communication is key, but how it's delivered matters. Even if the truth is stated, the way it's said can affect the other person deeply.\n\nThe author didn't bring up this preference before, which might have led the girlfriend to believe he was okay with her body. The fact that he kept this to himself for three years without discussing it could have contributed to her feeling lied to. It's possible that he didn't realize how important body image was to her, or maybe he didn't know how to approach the topic.\n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his preferences, which isn't inherently wrong. But in a relationship, honesty needs to be balanced with empathy and consideration. The timing and context here are crucial. The girlfriend was already in a mental funk, and the author's response, while honest, might have been delivered without the necessary emotional support to handle her feelings.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's preference isn't a deal-breaker, as he says it's not a turn-off but not a turn-on. However, the way it's communicated can make the partner feel insecure or unattractive. The author might need to work on expressing his preferences without making his partner feel inadequate. The fact that he keeps her facing away during intercourse because of this preference might also make her feel that her body isn't appreciated in the way she wants.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both partners should feel valued and respected. The author's honesty is important, but it's equally important to consider the partner's feelings. Maybe there's a way to express his preferences in a way that doesn't invalidate her. The key here is whether the author's actions and words have caused harm and if there's a way to address it constructively.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's honesty was communicated in a harmful way. Since the girlfriend felt hurt and lied to, it might be that the author didn't handle the situation well, even if the truth is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional impact of his words and didn't address the issue with sensitivity.\n"
