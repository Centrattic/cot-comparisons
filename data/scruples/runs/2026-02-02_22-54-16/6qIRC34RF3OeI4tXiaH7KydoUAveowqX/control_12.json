We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy admitting to his girlfriend that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. They've been dating for three years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had asked him about it directly after trying on lingerie and feeling insecure. He responded honestly, which she found hurtful. He says he's being truthful, but she feels lied to because he never mentioned it before. \n\nHonesty in relationships is important, but so is communication. The guy might have thought he was being honest, but timing and approach matter. He waited until she brought it up, which was after she was already feeling insecure. Maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier rather than just stating his preference in the moment. \n\nAlso, saying that her body isn't a turn-on, even if it's not a deal-breaker, can be hurtful. The fact that she felt the need to ask suggests she's been struggling with self-esteem related to her body. He could have been more supportive, maybe acknowledged her feelings first before stating his preference. \n\nRelationships require balance between honesty and kindness. While it's okay to have preferences, expressing them in a way that doesn't invalidate your partner's feelings is crucial. The guy's response might have been too direct without considering the emotional impact. So, he's in the wrong because he could have handled the situation more sensitively.\n"
