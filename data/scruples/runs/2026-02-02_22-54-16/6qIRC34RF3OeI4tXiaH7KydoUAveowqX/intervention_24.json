We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body. The situation is about physical attraction, specifically her chest size. They've been together for three years, and he's never mentioned this before. The girlfriend was upset because he didn't find her chest attractive, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is honest about his preferences, which he states aren't a deal-breaker but just not a turn-on. The girlfriend had insecurities about her body, and the author's comment triggered those feelings. The key here is communication. The author didn't address this issue before, even though it's a significant part of physical intimacy. \n\nIn a long-term relationship, open communication about such matters is usually important. If he's been facing away during intercourse because of her chest size, that's a recurring issue that should have been discussed. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she felt lied to or misled, not because of the comment itself, but because it came as a surprise after three years. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being truthful. Lying about attraction can be harmful, but the timing and approach matter. He could have approached the conversation more sensitively, acknowledging her feelings first before stating his preferences. However, the core issue is that he didn't communicate his preference earlier, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's honest, which is good, but not addressing the issue sooner and the way he brought it up might have contributed to the problem. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and his honesty, while important, could have been handled more thoughtfully. Therefore, the author might bear some responsibility for not addressing this earlier and for the manner of the conversation. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the issue is about attraction and communication, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't address it sooner and his comment hurt her. Alternatively, if we consider that he's just being truthful, maybe not. However, the context of a long-term relationship and the impact on her mental state suggests that his lack of prior communication does make him partially at fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the communication timing and the resulting hurt.\n"
