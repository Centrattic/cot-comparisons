We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for three years. The girlfriend is thin and petite, which is different from the author's previous partners. She's been insecure about her chest size and even tried on lingerie that didn't fit. The author admitted he prefers bigger chests and isn't attracted to her current size. He also mentioned that's why he prefers her facing away during sex.\n\nNow, the key points here. Communication in relationships is crucial. The author didn't bring up this preference before, even though his girlfriend had expressed insecurity. By not addressing it earlier, he might have contributed to her feelings of inadequacy. When she asked, he was honest but maybe not compassionate enough. While honesty is important, the way it's delivered matters. The girlfriend felt hurt and lied to, which suggests the communication was hurtful. The author's honesty was factual, but in a way that didn't consider her feelings or the long-term impact. \n\nAlso, considering that she had already been struggling with body image issues, bringing up this preference without prior discussion could be seen as insensitive. The author's actions led to her emotional pain, which is a red flag. Even if his intentions were to be honest, the timing and method were poor. \n\nIn relationships, honesty should be paired with empathy. The author might not be \"wrong\" in the sense that he's being truthful, but the way he handled it was unkind and possibly damaging. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and not addressing her insecurities earlier shows a lack of awareness of her emotional needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. He should have communicated his preferences earlier and in a more supportive way to avoid hurting her feelings. The damage was done by not being considerate of her insecurities and bringing up the issue in a context that made her feel rejected.\n"
