We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been together three years, and he's honest with her about preferring a larger chest. The girlfriend felt hurt and like he lied, even though he never brought it up before.\n\nFirst, honesty in relationships is important. The author did tell the truth, but maybe the way he delivered it was harsh. The girlfriend has insecurities about her body, especially after trying on lingerie and feeling she's not attractive. The author's comment might have triggered her insecurity without considering her feelings.\n\nCommunication timing matters. He didn't bring it up before, so she might have thought he was okay with her body. Now, bringing it up suddenly can feel like a betrayal, even if truthful. He could have approached it more gently, maybe by affirming her attractiveness in other ways before stating his preference.\n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers her facing away might be a way to avoid the issue, but without addressing her feelings. The key here is that while honesty is good, it's how it's communicated that affects the other person. So, the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for him to improve in how he handles such conversations. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong for being honest, but he could have handled it better. But since the options are A (yes) or B (no), the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. The main issue is his communication approach, not the honesty itself.\n"
