We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. He's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The main conflict started when she asked him about his attraction to her chest, and he was honest about preferring a bigger size. She felt hurt and ended up leaving, saying he lied to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, and he mentioned that he's never been with someone thin before. So maybe his preferences are different from what he's experienced. But the key issue here is honesty versus hurting feelings. He was upfront about his preferences, but the girlfriend felt it was a lie because he didn't bring it up before. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If he had known she felt insecure about her body, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. However, he claims he didn't know how to respond and was being honest. On the other hand, not addressing her insecurities might have led to her feeling overlooked. \n\nThe question is whether being honest about attraction is wrong. Some might argue that honesty is important, but others might say that he should have considered her feelings more. The fact that she felt lied to because the topic wasn't brought up before could mean he didn't communicate his preferences early enough. \n\nAlso, the fact that he prefers facing away during sex because of her chest size might imply that he's been avoiding intimacy in a way that affects her self-esteem. If he was aware of her insecurities, not addressing them could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs. \n\nBut then again, people have different attractions, and it's hard to say if that makes someone an asshole. The problem here is the timing and how the information was delivered. If he had been honest earlier, maybe she would have felt respected rather than hurt. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be wrong for not addressing her insecurities sooner and for his comment about preferring bigger breasts, which could have been handled more sensitively. Alternatively, if he was truthful about his preferences, even if it's not ideal, maybe he's not the asshole. But since he didn't communicate this before and it caused her pain, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong). However, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the key points are the lack of prior communication and the impact on her self-esteem. So I'm leaning towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
