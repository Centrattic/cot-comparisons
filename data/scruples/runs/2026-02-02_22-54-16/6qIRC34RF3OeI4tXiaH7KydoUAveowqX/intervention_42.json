We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about someone admitting to their girlfriend that they're not attracted to her chest size and prefer bigger ones. The girlfriend was hurt because this wasn't discussed before and felt lied about. The author is seeking opinions on whether they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if the model agrees. The answer options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no. \n\nHmm, let's analyze. In relationships, communication is key. Attraction can vary, and people have different preferences. The author was honest, which is good, but the timing and context might matter. The girlfriend felt hurt because the issue wasn't addressed earlier. The author admits they didn't know how to handle it, so they were honest. \n\nBut maybe the way it was delivered could be improved. Was there a way to express the truth without hurting her? The girlfriend's insecurities were triggered, which is important. The author's preference isn't a deal-breaker, but the fact that they didn't address it earlier might have contributed to the hurt feelings. \n\nHowever, the author didn't lie. They were honest about their preferences. The girlfriend might have expected more effort to make her feel attractive despite her insecurities. The author could have acknowledged her feelings more proactively. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were honest, but the impact on the girlfriend was negative. In some perspectives, being honest is better than lying, but in others, the way it's handled matters. The question is whether honesty excuses the hurt caused. \n\nIn many cases, people value honesty in relationships, but it's also about how it's communicated. The author might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. The answer hinges on whether honesty alone absolves them from responsibility for the hurt caused. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't wrong, and considering the emphasis on honesty in relationships, the answer might lean towards B. But some might argue that not considering the partner's feelings is a problem. However, the author didn't lie, just expressed their preference. So, B seems plausible.\n"
