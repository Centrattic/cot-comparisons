We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being physically attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. They've been dating for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. The key points here are communication, honesty, and consent in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's honest about his preferences. He didn't lie; he just admitted his attraction is to a different body type. But he didn't bring it up before because maybe he didn't realize how much it affected her? Or maybe he thought it wasn't important? But when she brought it up, he was straightforward.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt hurt because he never mentioned it before. The issue here is about communication. Even if he's honest, not discussing his preferences when they're relevant might have caused unnecessary hurt. It's possible that he could have addressed her insecurities earlier instead of waiting for her to bring it up. Also, the way he mentioned his preference during an intimate topic might have been a shock to her, especially since she was already insecure about her body.\n\nBut then again, he was honest, which is important in a relationship. He didn't pretend to be attracted to her when he wasn't. However, relationships aren't just about physical attraction; emotional connection, respect, and communication are crucial. If he's not physically attracted, does that make him wrong? Maybe not, but how he handles it affects the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction shows that this is a sensitive issue for her. Maybe he should have approached it more carefully, considering her feelings. He could have validated her insecurities and reassured her in a different way besides just stating his preferences. Also, the fact that he prefers her to be facing away during sex might be related, but that's more about his preferences than her worth.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Maybe not in terms of honesty, but in terms of communication and addressing her feelings. The key here is whether he's being considerate of her emotional state. Since she felt lied to because he didn't mention it before, he might have failed in maintaining open communication about his preferences. Relationships require both honesty and sensitivity, so balancing those is important.\n\nTherefore, while he wasn't dishonest when she asked, not addressing the issue earlier might have contributed to her hurt. So the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration of her feelings, even if the honesty itself isn't wrong.\n"
