We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her flat chest. He's been with her for three years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. He admits he prefers bigger chests and that he hasn't said anything before, which might have hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so communication is key. The girlfriend had insecurities about her body, and he didn't address them. When she asked directly, he finally told her the truth. But she felt lied to because he never mentioned it before. \n\nIs honesty a defense here? The author says he was just being honest. But maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier. If she's been insecure about her body, not addressing it could have contributed to her feelings of inadequacy. However, he didn't lie; he just hadn't discussed it. \n\nHe also mentions that he prefers her to face away during sex, which might be a coping mechanism. But not mentioning his preferences might have made her feel unattractive without his input. The key is whether he was aware of her insecurities and didn't provide reassurance. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate preferences, especially when it affects the other person's self-esteem. If he knew she was insecure and never reassured her, that's a problem. But he did tell her now, and she's hurt because he didn't bring it up before. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He was honest, but maybe he should have addressed her insecurities earlier. However, he didn't lie. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong but needs to work on communication. But some might say he should have been more considerate of her feelings from the start. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the lack of communication before counts as dishonesty. If the girlfriend felt lied to because he didn't share his preferences despite her insecurities, then he might be in the wrong. But if he was just being honest and she's reacting now, maybe he's not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he was honest, but there's a need for better communication in the future.\n"
