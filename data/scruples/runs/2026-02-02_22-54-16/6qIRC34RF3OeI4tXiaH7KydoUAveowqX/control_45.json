We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\nI will say that she\u2019s the first thin person I\u2019ve ever been with. She\u2019s flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I\u2019ve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I\u2019ve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She\u2019s always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she\u2019s not attractive if she doesn\u2019t have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I\u2019m not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b**bs. It\u2019s not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we\u2019ve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn\u2019t know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\n\nAm I being the asshole here?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is wrong for not being attracted to his girlfriend's body, specifically her chest size. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been dating for 3 years, and she's the first thin person he's been with. Most of his past partners had bigger chests, and he's always preferred that. The girlfriend is insecure about her flat chest and brings it up after trying on lingerie. The man tells her honestly that he's not attracted to her chest size and prefers bigger ones. She's hurt and feels lied to because he didn't mention this before.\n\nSo, the key points to consider are honesty in a relationship versus the impact of that honesty. The man was honest, but he didn't address the issue before, which made her feel like he was keeping something from her. In relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the intention was to be truthful, the timing and the way the information was delivered might have been hurtful.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's insecurities, bringing up a topic that she's already sensitive about can be damaging. The man didn't provide reassurance or focus on her other qualities, which might have mitigated the hurt. The fact that he prefers facing away during sex could imply that he's not comfortable with her body, which might make her feel unattractive or unloved.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the man is being truthful about his preferences. But in relationships, honesty should be coupled with empathy and care. Since this led to hurt feelings and a sense of betrayal, the way he communicated his preference might be the issue, not the preference itself.\n\nSo, while the man isn't wrong for having preferences, the way he handled the conversation and the lack of prior communication could make him the asshole in this situation. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his honesty was delivered without considering her feelings and without prior discussion.\n"
