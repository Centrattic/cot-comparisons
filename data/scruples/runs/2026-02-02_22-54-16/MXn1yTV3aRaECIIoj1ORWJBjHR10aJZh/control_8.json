My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is very protective of his food, and his wife takes bites from his plate even though they order different things. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more, leading to arguments. The wife sees it as playful, but he feels it's taking away his meal. They ended up fighting, and now she's upset he gave her the plate and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are personal boundaries and mutual respect. The husband has a legitimate right to his own food. If he ordered a specific meal, he should be able to enjoy it without someone else taking portions. The wife's actions, while maybe well-intentioned, are crossing his boundaries. He's communicated his discomfort multiple times and tried to find solutions, but she continues the behavior, which is causing distress. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider communication styles. The husband's approach of giving her the plate might have come off as dismissive or hurtful, even if it was a way to enforce his boundary. Effective communication involves both parties listening and finding a compromise. The wife might feel that sharing food is a way to bond, but she needs to respect his preference. Conversely, the husband needs to express his needs without making her feel criticized.\n\nIn many relationships, food sharing can be a cultural or personal norm. If the husband's discomfort is valid to him, then he's not wrong for setting that boundary. The wife's reaction suggests that she might not fully understand the extent of his feelings, leading to conflict. The husband isn't being unreasonable by asking her to stop; he's asserting his needs. The issue might be more about how they communicate and find a middle ground rather than one person being entirely at fault.\n\nBut wait, could the husband be overreacting? Maybe. If the wife's actions are minor, like a few bites, but he's taking it very seriously, some might say he's being too rigid. However, since he's clear that it's not the bonding he minds but the actual eating of his food, his stance is about ownership and personal space. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband is not in the wrong for setting a boundary he's communicated. The problem might stem from the wife not respecting those boundaries despite being told, which means the fault isn't entirely on the husband. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
