My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple dining out, and the husband is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate. He's asked her to stop, but she doesn't listen, leading to a fight. \n\nFirst, I should consider the main points. The husband feels protective of his food and doesn't want her to take bites from his plate. He's tried setting boundaries\u2014like allowing a couple of bites and offering to order her the same thing\u2014but she still takes more than that. He ends up giving her the plate, which makes her upset. She argues it's playful, but he sees it as a problem because he ends up not getting enough to eat.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his personal preference about his food. It's not like he's being rude or aggressive, just setting limits. On the flip side, the wife's actions are causing him discomfort and affecting his meal. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond, but if it's making him unhappy, maybe she should respect his wishes. \n\nBut then again, maybe the husband could have approached it differently. Maybe he's being too rigid? Or perhaps the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, which is her fault. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for standing up for his personal space regarding food. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband has tried to explain his feelings and set boundaries, which is reasonable. The wife's reaction might be because she feels her behavior isn't a big deal, but if it's causing conflict, she should adjust. The husband isn't being unreasonable by wanting to eat his own food without interference. So maybe he's not in the wrong here. \n\nBut some might argue that sharing food can be a fun part of the experience, and the husband's strictness is causing issues. However, the fact that he ends up half-full and the situation leads to a fight suggests that the wife isn't respecting his limits. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the wife is the one not respecting his boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No).\n"
