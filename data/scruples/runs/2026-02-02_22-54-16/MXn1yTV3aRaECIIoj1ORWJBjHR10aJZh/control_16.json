My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author clearly states he's very protective of his food and that it's driving him insane. He's tried to communicate his boundaries multiple times, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. He even offers to order her the same thing or pay for her to switch meals. The problem is she keeps taking from his plate, leading to a fight.\n\nThe wife on the other hand sees it as playful and cute. She's not respecting his boundaries, even after he's explained his feelings. The author gives examples where she insists she's not hungry but ends up eating his food. The last incident led to a fight where she felt judged, but the author's actions were a direct response to her breaking the agreed-upon rules.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Boundaries in relationships are important. If someone consistently disrespects another's boundaries despite clear communication, that's a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable here; he's standing up for his personal space and preferences. The wife's actions are the ones that are causing conflict by not respecting his wishes. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
