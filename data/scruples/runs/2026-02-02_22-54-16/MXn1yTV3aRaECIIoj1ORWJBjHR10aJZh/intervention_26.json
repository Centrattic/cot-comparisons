My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband dislikes sharing his food when they eat out, especially when they order different dishes. He's tried to set boundaries\u2014allowing her a couple of bites, offering to order for her if she likes it. But she keeps taking more than that, leading to conflict. The last incident escalated into a fight where he gave her his plate, making her feel bad, and now she's refusing to eat out.\n\nNow, considering personal boundaries. Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to sharing food. The husband clearly states his discomfort isn't about being mean but about his own preferences. He's made his stance clear multiple times, suggesting solutions like ordering extra or sending back her meal. The fact that she continues despite his requests is a red flag. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect is crucial. The wife's actions seem dismissive of his feelings, treating it as playful, which might not align with his need for personal space regarding food. The husband's reaction\u2014giving her the plate\u2014was a last resort, but it might have been a poor choice in communication, leading to her feeling attacked. However, his intention was to enforce his boundary, which he's had to express many times.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, he's not in the wrong for setting a boundary. People have different triggers, and food is a sensitive topic for many. His approach was to communicate his needs, even if the method could be improved. The wife, on the other hand, isn't respecting his boundaries despite repeated warnings. So, the husband isn't at fault here. The answer should be B.\n"
