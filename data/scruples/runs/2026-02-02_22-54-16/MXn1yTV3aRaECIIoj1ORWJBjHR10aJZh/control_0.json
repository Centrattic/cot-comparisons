My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe author mentions that he's very protective of his food and that his wife takes bites from his plate when they eat out. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. He ends up feeling like he's competing for his own food. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. The conflict escalated into a fight where the author gave her his plate, making her feel like a pig. Now, she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nHmm, so the core issue is about boundaries and differing perspectives on sharing food. The author feels his personal space and choice to have his own meal are being invaded. The wife seems to not respect those boundaries, interpreting the situation as playful rather than intrusive. The argument here is whether the author's request is reasonable or if he's overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author has communicated his feelings multiple times and even offered solutions like paying for her to get her own dish. However, the wife hasn't respected those boundaries, leading to frustration. The author's actions, like giving her the plate, might have been a result of his frustration. But was it wrong of him to set those boundaries?\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests she felt criticized or judged. The author's action of giving the plate might have been a mistake in how he communicated his frustration. So, maybe both have some responsibility. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the author has repeatedly communicated his discomfort and tried to find solutions, but the wife didn't respect it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs. The problem might be that the wife didn't listen, but the author's actions were in response to her not respecting his boundaries. So the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I should make sure there's no cultural or social norm I'm missing. In some cultures, sharing food is common, but the key here is mutual respect. If one person is uncomfortable, the other should respect that. So the author is justified in asking her to stop.\n"
