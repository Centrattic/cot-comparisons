My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is frustrated because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He mentions that he's protective of his food and that this behavior leads to him being only half-full. He's tried negotiating, suggesting she can have a bite or two and he'll order it for her next time if she likes it. He's even offered to pay for anything on the menu. But she continues to take more than a few bites, which makes him feel like they're competing over his food. The situation escalated to a fight where he gave her his plate, which upset her, and now she's reluctant to go out to eat anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author clearly states his preferences and has set boundaries multiple times, but the wife isn't respecting them. On the other hand, the wife might see this as playful and not a big deal. But the author's discomfort is valid because he has the right to his own food, especially when he's paid for it. \n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author's approach might be too rigid. Maybe he could have handled the situation differently, like discussing it calmly instead of giving his plate away, which might have been perceived as confrontational. But his main issue is about his personal space and food, which are legitimate concerns. \n\nThe wife's actions, while perhaps meant to be playful, are crossing a boundary that the author has communicated. The author is expressing his needs, which is important in a relationship. The problem here is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The wife, however, is not respecting those boundaries, which is the root of the issue. The author's frustration is valid because he's had to repeatedly explain the same thing without resolution. The fight likely could have been avoided if there was better communication or compromise, but the core issue is about respecting personal limits. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
