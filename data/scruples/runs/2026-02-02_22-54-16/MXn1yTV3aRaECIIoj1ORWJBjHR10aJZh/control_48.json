My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. So first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe author is clearly bothered by his wife eating from his plate when they eat out. He mentions being protective of his food, which he references the Friends episode where Phoebe is really into her food. He's asked her to just take a couple of bites to try, and if she likes it, he'll order it for her. But she keeps taking a lot from his plate anyway. He says it's making him go home half-full, which is frustrating. The last straw was when he gave her the plate, which made her feel like a pig, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. From the information given, it's about personal boundaries regarding food. The wife's actions are causing the author distress, so he's trying to set limits. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has communicated his feelings multiple times, explaining that he's okay with her trying a couple of bites but not treating his plate as shared. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and can't resist. The conflict arises when she continues despite his requests, leading to the author taking action (giving her the plate) which she then felt was a slight.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, personal boundaries are important. If someone consistently disrespects another's boundaries despite being asked, that's a problem. The author is asserting his own boundaries here. However, the wife's actions might come from a place of wanting to bond or share, which she might not realize is causing such a strong reaction. The fight suggests that communication broke down, maybe because the author's approach (giving her the plate) was perceived as shaming, even if that wasn't his intent.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because he's trying to communicate his needs and set boundaries. It's his right to expect that his food isn't taken without consent. However, the way he handled the last incident (giving her the plate) might have been a poor choice, leading to the fight. So maybe there's a better way to handle it, but he's not in the wrong for asserting his boundaries. The wife is in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. But the answer is whether the author is in the wrong, so based on the info, it's B.\n"
