My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is upset that his wife eats off his plate when they go out to eat, even though they order different things. He's very protective of his food and finds it annoying. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. The author has tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she still takes more, leading the author to give her the plate, which made her angry. They ended up in a fight, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. He clearly states that he's protective of his food and that this behavior makes him feel like he's competing for his own meal. He's tried to set boundaries but they haven't worked. He ends up giving her the plate, which he thought was a solution, but it backfired. His intention was to make eating out enjoyable for both, but his wife's actions are making it stressful for him.\n\nNow, the wife's side: she sees eating off his plate as playful and bonding. She might not realize how much this behavior is affecting him. She agreed to not order the same thing but still took multiple bites, which he found unacceptable. When he gave her the plate, she felt insulted, thinking he was accusing her of being a pig.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has tried to explain his feelings and set boundaries, which is important. The wife, however, isn't respecting those boundaries, possibly because she doesn't see the issue. But does that make the author wrong? Well, he's expressing his own feelings and trying to maintain his personal space, which is valid. People have different comfort levels, and it's okay for him to want his own food to himself.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of giving her the plate in the moment, which might have been a confrontational move, he could have calmly reasserted his boundaries again. However, the core issue is about personal space and respect for those boundaries. If the wife isn't respecting his boundaries despite his clear communication, then the problem lies more with her not respecting his wishes rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own needs and has communicated them. The wife needs to adjust her behavior. The answer is B.\n"
