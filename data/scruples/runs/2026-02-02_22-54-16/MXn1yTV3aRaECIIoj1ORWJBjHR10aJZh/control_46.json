My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author finds it annoying because they want to eat their own food, and the wife sees it as playful.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author clearly communicates their discomfort with the wife eating from his plate. He's even tried to negotiate by allowing a couple of bites and offering to reorder or pay for her to have her own. But the wife continues, which leads to conflict. He ends up giving her the plate, which made her feel insulted.\n\nOn the flip side, the wife might feel that sharing food is a way to bond and that her actions are harmless. She might see it as a way to connect, and the author's insistence on boundaries could be perceived as being overly controlling or not trusting her. The fact that they ended up in a fight after he gave her the plate suggests that his action might have been taken as an accusation, which escalated the situation.\n\nNow, considering personal boundaries, it's reasonable for someone to want control over their own food. People have different comfort levels, and the author's feeling that his food is his own is valid. However, the way he handled the situation could be problematic. Giving her the plate might have been a direct confrontation without considering her feelings. Instead of giving up his food entirely, maybe he could have found another way to express his discomfort without making her feel like a pig, which is harsh and could hurt her feelings.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction suggests she values the shared experience more, and the author's strictness might not align with her view of the situation. Communication is key here. The author tried to set boundaries, but maybe he needs to find a compromise that both respects his need for personal space with food and her desire to share. The fact that she's now refusing to go out to eat could strain their relationship, so it's a balance between personal preferences and mutual respect.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, neither side is entirely at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author has a valid reason to be upset about someone eating his food. But his response\u2014giving her the plate and the way the confrontation happened\u2014could be seen as harsh. The wife, on the other hand, might need to be more considerate of his feelings. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate boundary. But the way he enforced it might not have been the best. However, in these AITA scenarios, the answer is usually either A or B, so I have to pick.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's asserting his personal boundaries, which is reasonable. The wife also has her perspective, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. He tried to communicate and set boundaries, so he's not the asshole here.\n"
