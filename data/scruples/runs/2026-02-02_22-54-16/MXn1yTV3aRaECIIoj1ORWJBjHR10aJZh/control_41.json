My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from his meal when they eat out, which really bothers him. He's tried setting boundaries, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that when you order your own plate, it's personal and he doesn't want her eating his food. He's even offered to buy her whatever he's having if she likes it. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and maybe a bonding experience. She might feel that sharing food is a natural part of their relationship and that he's being too possessive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, personal boundaries vary. Some people are more comfortable sharing food, others not. The key here is mutual respect. The author has clearly communicated his feelings and tried to find solutions. The wife, however, hasn't respected his boundaries despite being told. That could indicate that the issue is on her side. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to keep his own food; it's about personal space and comfort. The wife might need to adjust her behavior if it's causing distress. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
