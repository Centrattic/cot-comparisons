My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset because their wife keeps eating off his plate when they're at a restaurant. He's mentioned that they tried an agreement where she can have a couple of bites, but she ends up eating a lot. He feels like it's his meal since he ordered it, and it's making him go home hungry. The wife thinks it's playful, but now they fought, and she's not wanting to go out to eat anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with his wife taking his food. Everyone has different boundaries, and in this case, sharing food from each other's plates is a point of contention. The author tried to set a limit, allowing a few bites but not treating the entire meal as shared. However, the wife doesn't respect that, leading to the fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as a way to bond or share in the experience of dining out. In many relationships, sharing food is a normal and affectionate behavior. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. The fact that she says it's playful and that he's making a big deal could mean she doesn't see it as a problem, or at least not in the same way he does.\n\nThe author's main argument is about personal ownership of the meal. He ordered it, so he feels it's his. But in a relationship, couples often have to compromise on various things. The question is whether his stance is reasonable. He's not saying she can't eat anything from his plate, just a couple of bites. However, she's going beyond that and taking multiple bites, which he finds detrimental to his meal.\n\nThe wife's reaction to being called a pig is interesting. She might feel that he's being judgmental or controlling over her food choices. Maybe she's trying to be humorous, but it's coming off as dismissive of his feelings. The fight arose because he took the plate away, which could be seen as a conflict over a small issue. But if it's causing him to feel like he's missing out on his meal every time, that's a legitimate concern.\n\nI should check if there's a cultural norm here. In some places, sharing food is a common practice, but in others, it's not. The author is in a situation where his boundaries are being crossed repeatedly despite his attempts to communicate. The key here is mutual respect. If the wife is not respecting his boundaries and the author is trying to enforce them, neither is entirely wrong. But since the author is the one who initiated the discussion and tried to set limits, which were ignored, maybe he's in the right to be upset. \n\nThe wife's actions are causing the author distress, affecting their dining experience. The fact that he had to give her the plate to stop her from eating further, which upset her, shows that he was trying to stand his ground. However, the way he handled it might have escalated the situation. Maybe a more constructive approach could have been taken, like discussing their different needs and finding a middle ground. \n\nBut the core issue is his discomfort with her taking his food. It's his right to have personal boundaries. The wife's behavior is the main problem here, as she's not respecting his wishes. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
