My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is about the wife eating off the husband's plate when they go out to eat. The husband is really bothered by this and it led to a fight. He says he's tried to explain that he's okay with her having a few bites but not treating his plate as shared. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. The husband ends up not getting to eat his whole meal because she takes so much, which frustrates him. He even offered to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. But she keeps doing it anyway. Then when he takes away his plate, she gets angry and says he made her feel like a pig. Now they're fighting and she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. The husband has a legitimate issue with his personal space/food being taken without consent. Even if the wife is trying to be affectionate, if it's causing the husband distress and affecting his enjoyment, that's a problem. The husband tried to communicate his feelings and set boundaries, but she didn't respect them. His action of giving her the plate might have been a strong move, but maybe he felt it was necessary because he's been ignored for so long. However, taking away the plate in the middle of the meal might have been confrontational. But the bigger issue is that she's repeatedly not respecting his wishes. \n\nOn the flip side, the wife might feel that the husband is being overly sensitive. Maybe she didn't realize how much it was bothering him. But he has been clear about it multiple times. If she keeps doing it despite his communication, that's on her. The husband's desire to have his own food is valid. People have different comfort levels. So, in terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't in the wrong for standing up for his boundaries. The wife is not respecting his boundaries, so she's the one at fault here. The husband's actions, while perhaps harsh, are a result of her not listening. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
