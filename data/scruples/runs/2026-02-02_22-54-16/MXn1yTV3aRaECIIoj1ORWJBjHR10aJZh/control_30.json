My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because their wife keeps eating off their plate when they go out to eat. They mention being very protective of their food, referencing the Friends show, which I think is where Ross says \"My sandwich!\" So they're taking it seriously. The wife takes bites from his plate, even when they ordered different things, and the author feels like they end up half full. They've tried setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites, but the wife doesn't respect it. The argument escalated to a fight, with the wife feeling targeted when the author gave her the plate to stop her from taking more. Now the wife is upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the possible points. \n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason for being upset. People have different boundaries around food. Some are more comfortable sharing, others not. The author has clearly communicated their discomfort, even offering solutions like ordering the same thing again. The wife, however, isn't respecting those boundaries, leading to frustration and conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing food is a sign of intimacy or bonding. She might not realize how much it bothers her partner. The author gave her the plate, which could have been perceived as shaming, leading to the fight. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like calmly reiterating their preference without the confrontational action. But the core issue is the repeated disregard for the author's boundaries despite communication.\n\nIs the author wrong for having this preference? Probably not. It's about personal boundaries. The problem is that the wife isn't respecting them. The author isn't wrong in wanting to eat their own food without interference. The wife's actions are the main issue here, but the author's handling of the situation might have contributed to the conflict. However, the author's stance on food boundaries is reasonable. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
