My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. The wife, on the other hand, sees this as playful and cute, and the author feels it's making eating out stressful and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly communicates his discomfort and has tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites and offering to order for her if she likes his food. He's even paying for her meals if needed. However, the wife continues to take more than a bite, leading to conflict. The author ends up giving her his plate, which causes a fight. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's protecting his personal space and preferences. Food is a personal choice, and for someone to take from another's plate without consent might be seen as a boundary issue. The author isn't opposed to sharing communal food, like chips or wings, which are meant to be shared, but individual plates he sees as personal. His actions are about respecting his own boundaries and ensuring he can enjoy his meal. \n\nOn the wife's side, she might view eating off each other's plates as a bonding experience or a sign of affection. She might not realize how much it bothers him, especially since she's done it repeatedly despite his requests. However, the fact that it leads to arguments and the author feeling deprived of his meal suggests that her actions are causing harm, even if unintended.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author has tried to communicate his needs, but the wife hasn't respected those boundaries. The fight arises from her continued behavior despite his clear statements. The author's frustration is about not having his preferences honored, which is a common relationship issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's standing up for his personal space and has made his feelings known. The problem isn't his desire to have his own food but the wife's refusal to respect that boundary. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's seeking a resolution that works for both, like suggesting alternative ways to bond without taking his food. \n\nThe wife's reaction, feeling like a pig, seems misplaced because the issue is about her taking his food, not how much she eats. The fight stems from her not respecting his boundaries, not from the author's actions. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. He's advocating for his needs, which is healthy in a relationship.\n"
