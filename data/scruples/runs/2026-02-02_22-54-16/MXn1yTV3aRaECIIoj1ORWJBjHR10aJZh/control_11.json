My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He says he's very protective of his food and that it's driving him insane. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing her a couple of bites, and offering to order for her if she likes his dish. But she keeps doing it, and he ends up not getting to eat his full meal. The last time, he gave her his plate, which led to a fight. Now she's mad and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he values his own food and feels disrespected when his wife takes from his plate without permission. He's tried communication and compromise, but it's not working. His wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, and maybe she doesn't realize how much it bothers him. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond, and she's confused why he's making a big deal out of it.\n\nI need to think about whether the author has a valid point. Personal boundaries are important. If someone doesn't want to share their food, that's their choice. The wife, however, might not be aware of the extent of his discomfort. The fact that they've had a fight suggests that communication isn't fully working. But the author did try to explain his feelings multiple times. He even offered solutions, like ordering for her if she likes his food. The problem is that she's not respecting those boundaries, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own needs, which is reasonable. He's not aggressive, just asking her to stop. The wife, however, might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries after multiple requests. But perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe she sees the situation differently and feels that sharing food is a normal part of their relationship. The fact that the fight happened because he gave her the plate might indicate that his reaction was too strong. Maybe he could have handled it differently, but the core issue is her not respecting his wishes.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because the author is asserting his right to his own food and has tried to communicate clearly. The wife is the one not respecting his boundaries, so the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop.\n"
