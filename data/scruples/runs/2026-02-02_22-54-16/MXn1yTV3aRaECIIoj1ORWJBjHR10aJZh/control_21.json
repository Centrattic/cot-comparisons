My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for telling their wife to stop eating off their plate when they go out to eat. They mention that they're very protective of their food, and they don't like sharing their plate when they order different things. The wife takes bites from his plate and offers to share, but he doesn't want to eat hers. He's tried negotiating, saying a couple of bites is okay, but she keeps taking more. This leads to conflict, and now they had a fight where the wife felt accused, and she's upset. The author ended up giving her the plate, which made her angry, and now she doesn't want to go out to eat.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is about personal boundaries regarding food. The author feels their food should be theirs, while the wife sees it as playful sharing. \n\nFirst, I should consider common norms. In many cultures, sharing food can be a way to bond, but when someone orders their own meal, it's generally expected that it's their own. The wife might see it as a way to connect, but the author is clearly uncomfortable with it. The key here is communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe author has tried setting boundaries, explaining their discomfort, and even offering solutions like ordering more for her. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. The fact that the author's plate is their own and they paid for it, so they should be able to control how much they eat. The wife's behavior is leading to the author not getting enough food, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of the wife feeling criticized. The author gave her the plate, which she perceived as an accusation, leading to a fight. The author might not have communicated their feelings effectively, perhaps coming across as accusatory instead of expressing their needs. However, the wife's continued disregard for the author's boundaries might be the root issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is standing up for their own needs and boundaries, which is reasonable. The wife isn't respecting those boundaries, which is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to set limits, especially when it affects their own meal satisfaction. However, the way they handled the situation might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is asserting their right to their own food and has tried to resolve it without pushing the wife away, it's more about the wife not respecting the boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
