My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The wife does this regularly, and the author is really annoyed by it. He's tried explaining that he's okay with her taking a bite or two, but she keeps taking more, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective: he's protective of his food, doesn't want it taken without permission, and feels like he's not getting enough when she eats his meal. He's tried setting boundaries and even offered to pay for her to get the same dish. The wife sees it as playful and cute, maybe not realizing how much it's bothering him. She took the plate as a gesture, which made her feel insulted.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's clearly communicated his feelings and tried to find a solution. He's not being unreasonable by wanting to keep his own food, especially after ordering it. The wife's actions are the issue here. She's not respecting his boundaries, and the author is standing up for himself. However, the way he gave her the plate might have been a misstep. Maybe he could have handled it more calmly to avoid the fight. But he's been trying to explain it for a while, and she's not listening. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding and that he's overreacting. But the author isn't just a little bothered; it's driving him insane and led to a fight. The fact that he's had to mention it multiple times suggests that she's not respecting his limits. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his food. He's set clear boundaries. The problem lies with the wife not respecting those boundaries. However, communication could have been better. The author's action of giving her the plate was probably a mistake in the heat of the moment, which escalated the conflict. But overall, his stance is valid. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The wife's actions are the issue here, not his.\n"
