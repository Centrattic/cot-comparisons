My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband is really bothered by his wife eating from his plate when they order different dishes. He's clear that he's protective of his food and it's causing fights. He's tried negotiating, suggesting she can have a bite or two, and even offering to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. But she keeps doing it, which makes him feel like he's competing for his own food. The last straw was when she took multiple bites despite his offer, leading to a fight and her feeling insulted when he gave her his plate.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband has expressed his feelings multiple times and tried different solutions. He's not being unreasonable in setting boundaries, especially since it's his own food. However, the wife is also sharing her perspective that she sees it as playful and cute, which might mean she doesn't realize the extent of his discomfort. \n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's communicated his needs clearly and the wife is still not respecting that boundary, then he's not wrong for standing his ground. However, if he's not being understanding of her actions and not compromising enough, maybe there's a point where he's also at fault. But in this case, he's made multiple attempts to find a middle ground. The wife's actions are the issue here, not his response to them. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
