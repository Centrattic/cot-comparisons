My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is protective of his food when they eat out. He orders something specific and doesn't want his wife to eat from his plate beyond a couple of bites. He's tried explaining that he's okay with her trying a bite or two, but she keeps taking more, leading to him being hungry and stressed. The conflict escalated into a fight, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is about personal boundaries regarding his food. He finds it upsetting when his wife treats his meal as shared without his consent. From his point of view, he's being reasonable by allowing a couple of bites but she oversteps. His actions in giving her the plate were meant to enforce his boundaries, but it made her feel targeted.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and not a big deal. She might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding, and the author's strictness is making her feel unwelcome or like she's being criticized. The fight suggests that communication isn't working both ways. The author repeated his stance, but perhaps he didn't validate her feelings or understand her perspective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his needs, which is reasonable. People have different boundaries. However, the way he handled it (giving her the plate) might have been harsh. Maybe he could have communicated more gently or found a compromise. But does that make him wrong? Or is it a matter of differing values?\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The wife not respecting his food boundary is an issue, but the author also needs to find a way to express his needs without making her feel attacked. It's possible that both have valid points but need to work on mutual understanding. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's standing up for his own boundaries, which is a right thing to do, he's not in the wrong. The problem is more about how they're navigating each other's boundaries rather than the author being entirely at fault. So the answer is B, No.\n"
