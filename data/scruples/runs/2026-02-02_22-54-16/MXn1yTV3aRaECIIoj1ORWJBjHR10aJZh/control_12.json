My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is clearly uncomfortable with his wife eating from his plate when they go out. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites but not treating his food as shared. He's even offered to reorder or pay for her to have her own. But she keeps doing it, leading to a fight. Now, the wife is upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for setting this boundary.\n\nHmm. In relationships, boundaries are important. People have different expectations and comfort levels. The author is expressing his discomfort, which is valid. However, the way he handled the situation might be a factor. When he gave her the plate, she felt targeted, which escalated the conflict. But the core issue is about personal boundaries around food. Some people are more possessive about their food than others, especially in public settings. \n\nThe wife's actions are playful to her, but the author finds it stressful. The key here is whether the author overstepped by enforcing his preferences in a way that's disrespectful to her. He tried to communicate his feelings and offered solutions, but she didn't comply. When he gave her the plate, it might have come off as an accusation, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nBut the author's main point is about respecting his personal space and food. It's his right to set boundaries. The wife might need to respect that, even if she finds it odd. However, the author could have handled the situation more tactfully. The fight suggests that communication was an issue, maybe in how he delivered the message rather than the message itself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's asserting a boundary, even if it's unconventional, and his wife isn't respecting it, then he's not in the wrong. However, if his approach was confrontational or dismissive of her perspective, that might be a problem. The answer likely depends on whether the boundary is reasonable and if the communication was respectful. Since the author tried to explain and negotiate, and the wife continued, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
