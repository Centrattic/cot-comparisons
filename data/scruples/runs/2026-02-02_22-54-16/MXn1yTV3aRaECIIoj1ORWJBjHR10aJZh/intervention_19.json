My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The story describes the author's frustration with his wife's habit of taking bites from his plate when they order different items at restaurants. He's tried explaining his discomfort, offering solutions like paying for her to get her own meal, but she continues, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that he dislikes sharing his food, which is a personal preference. He's communicated this to his wife, tried to find compromises, but she doesn't respect his boundaries. On the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and maybe doesn't realize how much it's affecting him. However, she's continuing the behavior despite his requests, which could indicate a lack of respect for his feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has expressed his feelings and tried to set boundaries. If the wife still ignores those boundaries, she might be the one in the wrong. But since the question is about the author, the user thinks he's not in the wrong. The user's reasoning is that he's standing up for his own preferences and tried to resolve it amicably. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social norms that might influence this. In some cultures, sharing food is a sign of intimacy, but in others, it's a personal space issue. The author's approach seems reasonable\u2014he's not denying her food, just his own. The wife's response to the conflict (feeling like a pig and not wanting to eat out) suggests she's hurt, but the core issue is about respecting individual preferences. \n\nSince the author has made his stance known and tried multiple solutions without success, it's likely he's not in the wrong. The problem lies more with the wife not respecting his boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
