My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The author is clearly frustrated because his wife takes food from his plate when they eat out, even though they order different things. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps going. This led to a fight, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. From the author's perspective, he's protective of his food and feels that when he orders something, it's his to eat. He's even offered to pay for her to have the same meal if she likes it. But his wife keeps taking more than a few bites, which makes him feel like he's not getting to enjoy his full meal. He's trying to set boundaries, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees her actions as playful and cute. She might be used to sharing food as a way to bond or show affection. She might not realize how much this is bothering him. The fight escalated when he gave her the plate, making her feel like a pig, which she took as an insult. So, maybe there's a communication issue here. The wife might not be malicious, but she doesn't understand his feelings about his food.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual respect. The author is expressing his needs and boundaries, which is important in a relationship. It's okay for him to ask her to stop if it's making him uncomfortable. However, his approach might have been too abrupt when he gave her the plate, which triggered her negative reaction. But the core issue is her repeated disregard for his boundaries even after he's discussed it multiple times.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's preferences. The wife's actions, while maybe not intentional, are causing harm. The author's response to set a boundary is justified. So, from that standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is more about her not respecting his boundaries rather than him being at fault.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. If the wife's behavior is a long-standing habit and she's not malicious, could the author have handled it differently? Perhaps by finding a compromise or using a different method to express his feelings. However, the fact remains that he's made his feelings clear and she's still not respecting them. In that case, his actions to enforce his boundaries are valid.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's justified in setting boundaries about his personal space and preferences, especially when it's affecting his enjoyment of meals. The issue is more on the wife's side for not respecting his limits after repeated communication.\n"
