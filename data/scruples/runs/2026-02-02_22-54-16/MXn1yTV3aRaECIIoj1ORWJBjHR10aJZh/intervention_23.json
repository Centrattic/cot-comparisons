My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. The author is clearly upset about this and it led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's main issue is that he's protective of his own food and doesn't like her taking bites from his plate. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple bites and offering to reorder, but she keeps doing it. The wife finds it playful and cute, but he finds it annoying and it makes him feel like he's competing for his own food, leading to him leaving dinner half-full. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for personal boundaries and communication. The author has communicated his feelings multiple times, which is important. He's tried to compromise by allowing a few bites and offering to pay for her to get her own. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, continuing to take more than agreed. \n\nNow, the wife's perspective is that she sees it as a bonding experience and playful. But if the author explicitly dislikes it and has communicated this, her continued actions could be seen as disregarding his feelings. Even if she thinks it's harmless, she should respect his preferences. \n\nThe fight arose when the author gave her the plate, which she took as an insult. The author's action was a last resort after repeated issues, but it might have been a harsh approach. However, the root issue is her not respecting his boundaries despite his communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's preferences. The author isn't unreasonable for wanting his own food boundaries. The wife's actions, while perhaps intended as affectionate, are causing distress. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the wife not respecting his boundaries. The author has tried reasonable solutions and communicated clearly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
