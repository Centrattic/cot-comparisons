My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's upset that his wife keeps eating off his plate when they eat out. He's tried to set boundaries, but she doesn't respect them, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband clearly values his personal space when it comes to food. He's communicated his discomfort, even offering solutions like paying for her to get her own order. But his wife still takes from his plate, which makes him feel like he's competing for his food. That's a valid concern because everyone has different boundaries, and respecting those is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might see it as a playful or affectionate gesture. Maybe she doesn't realize how much it bothers him. However, the husband has repeatedly explained his feelings, so it's not like he hasn't made his position clear. The fact that she continues despite his requests could be seen as disregarding his boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The husband has communicated his needs, but the wife isn't respecting them. Boundaries, once set, should be honored. If she can't meet his needs without resentment, that's a problem. The argument that sharing food is a bonding experience might not hold if it's causing one person distress.\n\nAlso, the husband's actions when he gave her the plate and told her to eat it could have been misinterpreted. He might have come across as confrontational, but his intent was to enforce his boundary. The wife's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which is a common issue in communication breakdowns. However, the husband isn't wrong for standing up for his needs if they've been previously discussed.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. If the wife can't adjust her behavior, it might indicate a deeper issue of respecting each other's boundaries. The husband isn't wrong for wanting his own food; it's a personal preference. The fault here might lie more with the wife not respecting his boundaries, but the husband could also work on how he communicates his needs to avoid making her feel accused.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The issue is more on the wife's side for not respecting those boundaries after clear communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
