My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation involves the wife taking multiple bites from his meal when they order different dishes. The author feels protective of his food and has communicated his boundaries, but the wife continues, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author has clearly stated his discomfort and tried to find compromises, like allowing a couple of bites. The wife, however, doesn't respect that boundary and takes more than agreed. Even when he offers to order her the same dish, she refuses and still takes from his plate. This shows a pattern of the wife ignoring the author's preferences.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author has attempted to explain his feelings multiple times, but the wife's actions suggest she isn't respecting those communications. The fact that she's defensive and claims he made her feel like a pig indicates she's not seeing his perspective. \n\nShared meals can be different from individual plates. The author emphasizes that communal foods are okay, but when each person orders their own, it should be respected. The wife's actions turn individual meals into shared ones without consent, which is the crux of the issue. \n\nThe fight that resulted was due to the author asserting his boundary again, which the wife took as an insult. However, the author's main issue is about ownership and personal space regarding food. His reaction is a response to repeated behavior despite prior discussions. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting his food to himself, especially since he's communicated this. The wife's actions are the ones that breach the agreed-upon compromise. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the wife not respecting his boundaries despite repeated attempts to address it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
