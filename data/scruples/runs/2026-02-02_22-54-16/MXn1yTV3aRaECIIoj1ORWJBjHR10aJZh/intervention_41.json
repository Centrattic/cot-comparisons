My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is about personal boundaries and differing perspectives on sharing food. \n\nFirst, the author explains that he's very protective of his food when they eat out. He doesn't mind if she tries a bite or two, but when she treats his entire meal as shared, it bothers him. He's tried setting boundaries, like offering to pay for her to get her own dish if she likes his food. However, his wife continues to eat his food, which leads to conflict. The last incident resulted in a fight where he gave her his plate, making her feel like a pig, and now she's upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are personal space and mutual respect. The author has communicated his feelings clearly and tried to find compromises. He's even offered to pay for her to have her own meal if she likes his food. That shows he's making an effort. On the other hand, his wife seems to not respect his boundaries despite repeated requests. She views it as playful and cute, but he finds it stressful and frustrating.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable here; he's stating his preference and trying to find solutions. The wife, however, is not adhering to those boundaries, which is causing the conflict. The fight arose because the wife didn't adhere to what he had previously agreed to (a bite or two) and he had to take action, which she took as an insult.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the author's reaction of giving her the plate was a last-ditch effort to communicate his frustration. While it might have come off as harsh, the root cause is his consistent attempts to set boundaries that aren't being respected. The wife's response of feeling like a pig is a misinterpretation of the situation\u2014he's the one trying to protect his own meal, not her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's made his feelings known, tried to find compromises, and the conflict stems from his wife's unwillingness to respect his boundaries. The real issue is the lack of mutual respect from the wife's side, not the author's stance.\n"
