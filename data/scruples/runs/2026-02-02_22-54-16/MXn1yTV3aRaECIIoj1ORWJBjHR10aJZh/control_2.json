My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. So, the situation is that the wife keeps taking bites from his plate when they order different things while dining out. The author is protective of his food and wants to eat his own meal without sharing, but the wife sees it as playful. This led to a fight, and now the author is seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is that he dislikes sharing his food when he ordered it himself. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. He even offers to pay for her to get her own dish if she likes his food. The wife, on the other hand, acts like it's cute and playful, but the author feels it's taking away from his meal and causing stress.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to eat his own food? Well, personal boundaries are important. If the author is uncomfortable with sharing his food, it's reasonable to want to express that. He's tried to communicate his feelings multiple times, which is a good step. However, the way he handled the situation might be an issue. Giving her the plate could have been seen as a passive-aggressive move, leading to her feeling attacked. Communication is key in relationships, and even if the author is justified in his feelings, the method of addressing it could be better. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that she might not have fully understood or respected his boundaries, but the author also needs to find a way to express his needs without making her feel criticized. Maybe both parties have some responsibility here. The author isn't in the wrong for having a preference, but perhaps he should approach the conversation differently to avoid conflict. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that he's clearly communicated his feelings and tried solutions, it's more about how to handle the communication rather than being entirely at fault. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
