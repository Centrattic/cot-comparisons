My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife keeps eating off the husband's plate when they go out to eat, and he's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is very protective of his food, which he mentions is a Friends reference about Ross being protective of his sandwich. The wife takes multiple bites from his plate, even after he's set boundaries. He's tried negotiating, offering to pay for her to try his food, but she continues. This leads to a fight where he gives her his plate, making her feel like a pig, and now she's upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. To evaluate that, I should consider both sides. The husband has a legitimate right to feel his food is his own, especially when he ordered it. People can have different boundaries, and if he's communicated his discomfort and the wife keeps violating them, that's a problem. On the other hand, the wife might see it as playful and not malicious, maybe trying to bond. However, she's not respecting his boundaries, which is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband has tried to set clear boundaries multiple times, so it's not his fault if she's not respecting them. The wife's actions are disregarding his preferences, leading to conflict. The husband's response of giving her the plate was probably a last resort because he was frustrated, but he did communicate his reasons. The fact that the wife is now avoiding eating out might indicate she's also frustrated, but the initial issue is her not respecting his boundaries.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for standing up for his needs. The problem lies in the wife not respecting his boundaries despite his clear communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
