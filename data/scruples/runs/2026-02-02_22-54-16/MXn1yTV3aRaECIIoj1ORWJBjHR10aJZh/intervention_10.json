My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author explains that he's protective of his food when they go out to eat. His wife takes bites from his plate even when they order different dishes, which he finds annoying. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing her a couple of bites, but she continues taking more. This leads to him feeling like he's competing for his own food and ends up only half-full. The situation escalated into a fight after he gave her his plate when she kept taking bites, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is about personal boundaries and respecting his choice to have his own meal. He's communicated his discomfort multiple times, suggesting alternatives like ordering for her if she likes his food. On the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and shared bonding, which might be her way of connecting during meals. However, she didn't respect his boundaries when he asked her to stop, leading to the conflict.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal space and consent, when someone explicitly states that they don't want their food shared, and the other person continues to take from their plate despite discussions, it's a violation of that boundary. The author is trying to maintain his autonomy over what he eats, which is a reasonable expectation. The wife's actions, while perhaps meant to be affectionate, are disregarding his expressed preferences.\n\nThe fight escalated when the author gave her his plate, which might have been a defensive reaction. However, the root issue is that the wife didn't adhere to the boundaries he set. The author isn't wrong in asserting his needs, especially since he's made his feelings clear multiple times. The key here is whether respecting someone's boundaries is a valid reason for being upset. Since the wife continued the behavior despite being told otherwise, the author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground. The problem lies in the wife not respecting his boundaries, not the author for trying to enforce them.\n"
