My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. The scenario is that they go out to eat, order different things, and the wife keeps taking bites from his plate. The author says it's driving him insane and caused a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is expressing his discomfort with his wife's actions. He's tried to communicate his boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not treating it as a shared meal. He pays for her to have her own food if she likes his, but she still ends up eating his food. He says it makes him feel like he's competing for his own food and ends up feeling deprived.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. She took over the plate, leading to a fight. The author gave her the plate, which she took as offensive. Now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Boundaries in relationships are important. The author clearly communicated his feelings and tried to find solutions. The wife, however, didn't respect those boundaries, leading to conflict. The author's actions in setting a boundary aren't unreasonable. People have different levels of comfort with sharing food. The wife's reaction seems to stem from the author enforcing his boundary, which isn't his fault. He's not in the wrong for standing up for his needs. The issue is more on the wife not respecting his boundaries, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his needs and maintain his own comfort with food. The wife's actions are the problem here, not the author's insistence on his boundary.\n"
