My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly states that he's very protective of his own food, especially when they order different items. He's okay with a few bites to try, but when she keeps eating from his plate, making him feel like he's competing for his own meal, that's a problem. He's tried to negotiate, offering to order it for her if she likes it, but she continues regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife seems to see it as playful and bonding. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary, which is his right. However, he did give her the plate when they were at the restaurant, leading to a fight where she felt judged. \n\nI should think about common social norms. People often share food in a casual way when eating out, but that's usually when it's a shared dish. Ordering separate meals and then sharing from each other's plates is different. The author's issue isn't with sharing per se, but with her not respecting his plate as his own once it's ordered. \n\nThe wife's actions might be unintentionally inconsiderate. Even if she thinks it's cute, if it's making her partner uncomfortable and leading to a fight, that's a red flag. The author tried to communicate his feelings and offer solutions, which is a mature approach. \n\nBut then, when he gave her the plate during the argument, maybe that was a mistake. It's possible that he escalated the situation. Still, the main issue is her persistent behavior despite his requests. The husband has a right to feel his boundaries are crossed if her actions don't respect his wishes. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his personal boundaries, even though he needs to find a better way to communicate during conflicts. The wife's actions, while maybe not malicious, are disregarding his preferences, making her the one being inconsiderate here.\n"
