My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He says he's protective of his food, and he's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites but not treating his meal as shared. The wife seems to think it's playful and cute, but he ends up feeling like he's competing for his own food and ends up only half full. They had a fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that he doesn't want his food to be shared beyond a few bites. He's communicated this multiple times and even offered to pay for her to get the same meal if she likes it. The wife, on the other hand, doesn't seem to respect his boundaries, even when he's asked her multiple times. She starts taking multiple bites, even after he's given her the plate, which makes her upset because she feels he's making her feel like a pig. The fight happened because she didn't stop despite his clear communication.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author has tried to set clear limits and has even suggested compromises. If the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, then he's within his right to express his discomfort. However, the way he handled the situation might be part of the problem. Giving her the plate during the argument might have been a harsh move that escalated the conflict. Also, the fight could be a result of both not understanding each other's needs. The wife might feel that sharing food is a way to bond, which is a cultural or personal norm for her. But if he's not comfortable with it, she should respect that. However, the fact that she keeps doing it despite his requests could make her partially at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, he has tried to explain his feelings and set boundaries. If the wife continues to ignore those boundaries, then he's not wrong for standing his ground. However, maybe he could have handled the confrontation differently. For example, instead of giving her the plate in the heat of the moment, he could have calmly reiterated his feelings. The problem might be that the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, but the author might need to work on how he enforces them without making her feel attacked. But based on the information given, he's the one who communicated his needs and the wife didn't comply. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue is more about the wife not respecting them and the communication breakdown leading to the fight. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
