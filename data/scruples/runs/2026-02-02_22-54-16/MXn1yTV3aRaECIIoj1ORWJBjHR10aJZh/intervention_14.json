My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The situation involves the wife taking bites from the author's plate when they order different dishes at a restaurant. The author is very protective of their food, which is leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author clearly states they find it annoying and have tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, which is causing tension. The key here is consent and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe author isn't just complaining; they've made their feelings known and tried to find solutions. The wife's continued actions despite being asked suggest she isn't respecting the author's boundaries. While sharing food can be a way to bond, it's important that both partners are comfortable. The author's desire to have their own meal without interference is valid. \n\nHowever, relationships require negotiation. The author's response of giving up their plate might have been an overreaction, possibly escalating the conflict. The wife's feeling of being made to feel like a pig could be valid if the approach was harsh. But the core issue is about the wife not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. The wife isn't respecting the boundaries, which is the main problem. The author's actions to address the issue are justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
