My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from the husband's plate when they order different meals, which upsets him. He's tried to set boundaries by allowing a few bites but she continues, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and mutual respect in relationships. Sharing food in social settings can be a common practice, but it's subjective. The husband values his food being his own, while the wife sees it as playful. The key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable. \n\nThe husband has communicated his discomfort and offered alternatives, like ordering separate items or sharing in a different way. However, the wife doesn't respect these boundaries, leading to frustration. In relationships, communication is crucial. If one person's needs aren't being respected despite clear communication, it's a problem.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the husband's attempt to set boundaries (giving her the plate) might indicate she feels attacked, but the root issue is her not respecting his boundaries. The husband's stance is about personal space and property, which is valid. The author's actions are about maintaining their own comfort and respecting their own needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The wife is the one not respecting the established boundaries, so the answer should be B.\n"
