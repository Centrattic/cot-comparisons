My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their wife to stop eating off their plate when they go out to eat. The author is protective of their food and finds it annoying when the wife does this, even though they've tried to set boundaries. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, but ends up making the author eat half a meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly expressing their personal boundaries and discomfort. They have tried to communicate their preferences multiple times, even suggesting alternatives like ordering for each other if needed. Their main issue is that their food isn't being respected, leading to frustration and a fight. The wife's actions, while maybe well-intentioned, are causing the author stress and reducing their meal enjoyment.\n\nFrom a boundary perspective, it's important to respect each other's comfort levels. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014they just want to enjoy their own food without others taking from it. The wife's behavior, while perhaps playful, is disregarding those boundaries, which is a valid issue. However, the author's response of giving the plate to the wife might have come off as harsh, potentially contributing to the fight. But the core issue is the wife not respecting the established boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has tried to discuss it multiple times, but the wife hasn't adhered to the agreed-upon limits. The author's frustration is justified because they're trying to maintain their comfort and enjoyment in social situations. The wife's reaction, feeling judged, might be part of the problem, but the initial issue is her not honoring the boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their personal space and preferences, which is reasonable. The problem lies in the wife not respecting those boundaries, which is on her, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
