My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He's very protective of his food, and even though he's tried to explain that a bite or two is okay, she continues to take more. He mentions that this has led to a fight where she felt criticized when he gave her the plate and told her to stop. Now she's mad and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is about personal boundaries and food sharing. The author has expressed his discomfort multiple times, but the wife is not respecting his wishes. He's clear that he doesn't mind sharing in a communal setting but not when it's his own ordered plate. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and bonding, but the author finds it stressful and takes away from his dining experience.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From the author's perspective, he's communicated his needs and boundaries. He's even offered alternatives like ordering for her if she likes his food. The problem is that she isn't respecting those boundaries, leading to conflict. \n\nBut does the author have the right to be upset? Well, food is a personal item, and many people are protective of their own meals. The wife's actions are invading his personal space and affecting his enjoyment. The author isn't forbidding her from trying a little, just not treating his meal as hers. So, it's about mutual respect. If one person has set a boundary and the other is repeatedly not respecting it, the person who set the boundary isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the wife's actions are a form of affection or bonding. But if it's causing distress, then there's a problem. The author tried to address it calmly but the wife's reaction was defensive. However, the author's response of giving her the plate might have been a bit abrupt, but his intention was to stop her from eating his food, which he had a right to.\n\nI think the key here is that the author expressed his feelings and boundaries, and the wife didn't respect them. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting his food to be his own. So, he's not in the wrong. The wife is the one not respecting his wishes, which is causing the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
