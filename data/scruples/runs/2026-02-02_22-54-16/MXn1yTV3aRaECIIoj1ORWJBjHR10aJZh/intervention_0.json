My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is very protective of his food. When they order different dishes, his wife takes bites from his plate, which he finds annoying. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites and offering to order for her instead. But she continues, leading to a fight. Now, she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing his discomfort with sharing his food, which is a personal preference. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and doesn't see the issue. The author has communicated his feelings and tried solutions, but the wife hasn't respected those boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is important. The author did try to explain and find solutions. The wife's actions, while maybe seen as harmless by her, are causing distress. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to eat his own food. Food is a personal thing for him, and he's made that clear. The wife's reaction to the fight and her feeling targeted might stem from not understanding the depth of his feelings about the situation.\n\nIt's possible that the wife might not realize how much the behavior affects him. However, the author has tried to be accommodating (offering to pay for her to order the same thing) but she hasn't respected those efforts. The fight arose from a lack of mutual understanding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Everyone has different comfort levels. The wife might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries once they were set. The author's actions were to protect his own needs, which is reasonable. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
