My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with his wife eating from his plate. He's mentioned that he's protective of his food, even referencing the Friends joke, which is a common cultural reference for being possessive over food. He's tried to set boundaries\u2014allowing a bite or two, offering to pay for her to get her own, but she keeps doing it. This leads to arguments and him feeling like he's competing for his own food. The last incident escalated into a fight, with the wife feeling targeted when he gave her the plate and asked why she was eating his food. Now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. Maybe she feels it's a way to bond or share experiences. However, the author's main issue is ownership of the food he ordered. He's paying for the meal, so he feels entitled to his own plate. The fact that she sometimes says she's not hungry but still takes from his plate adds to his frustration.\n\nNow, considering personal boundaries and respect. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times and tried to find solutions, but it's not working. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, which is causing conflict. The author's actions in asking her to stop are about his right to his own food, especially since he's paying for it. The wife's actions, while maybe playful, are disregarding his boundaries. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. The author might need to consider if there's a middle ground he hasn't tried yet. But from the information given, he's already suggested alternatives like ordering for her. The key point is that he's expressed his feelings clearly, and she's not adhering, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for his personal space and preferences, which is valid. The wife's actions are the issue here because she's not respecting his boundaries. The author isn't wrong for trying to set those boundaries. The fight arose because the wife felt criticized, but the root cause is her not respecting his wishes. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his personal boundaries, which is a reasonable and necessary part of a relationship. The wife's actions are the problem, not the author's request to stop her from eating his food.\n"
