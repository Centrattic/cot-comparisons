My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author explains that he's very protective of his food and this behavior is causing fights. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not treating his plate as shared. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, and when he enforces the boundary, she gets upset and now doesn't want to go out to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is about personal boundaries and feeling that his ordered meal is his own. He's tried to communicate this, even offering to pay for her to try his food if she likes it. That seems reasonable. He's not being selfish; he just wants his food to be his own without being taken from him, leading to him being half-full.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might see sharing food as a way to bond and show closeness. In some cultures or relationships, sharing food is a sign of intimacy. However, the author has made it clear that this behavior upsets him. The problem arises when her actions cross his boundaries despite his communication. The fight happened because she continued the behavior, and when he finally gave in by giving her the plate, she felt insulted, which is a bit ironic.\n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, it's important to evaluate who is respecting the other's boundaries. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times and tried to find compromises. The wife, however, hasn't respected those boundaries, leading to conflict. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his own needs. It's reasonable for him to expect his personal space and food to be respected, especially when it's affecting his enjoyment of meals out.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she might not fully understand or acknowledge the author's feelings. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author is justified in his stance because he's made his preferences known and is trying to maintain a positive dining experience for both. The fact that she's now avoiding going out to eat because of this might indicate that she's not willing to adjust her behavior, which is on her side.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's advocating for his personal space and has made reasonable compromises. The issue lies more with the wife not respecting his boundaries despite his clear communication.\n"
