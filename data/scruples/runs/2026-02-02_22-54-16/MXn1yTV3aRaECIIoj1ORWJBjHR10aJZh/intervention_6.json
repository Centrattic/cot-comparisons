My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from his plate when they order different things, which the husband finds annoying and ends up making him feel like he's competing for his own food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The husband is clearly uncomfortable with the wife eating off his plate, even though he's offered to let her have a few bites or order a separate plate for her. He's tried communicating this, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and bonding, and she's upset when he gives her the plate and confronts her.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and respect. The husband has expressed his feelings multiple times and laid out boundaries. He's even suggested solutions like ordering for her or sharing other types of food. If she's still not respecting his boundaries, then maybe she's at fault. But the fight happened because he gave her the plate and accused her, which she took as making her feel like a pig. \n\nHowever, the husband's actions might be seen as reactive. He gave her the plate as a last resort after she kept taking from his meal, which could be seen as escalating the situation. But he had communicated his discomfort before, so maybe he's not in the wrong. It's about mutual respect. If she's not respecting his boundaries, he has a right to stand his ground. On the flip side, his response might have been harsh, but he's justified in wanting to eat his own food without feeling deprived.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband tried to address it calmly and offered solutions. If the wife isn't respecting those, he's justified in enforcing his boundaries. The argument might have been handled better, but the core issue is her not respecting his boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
