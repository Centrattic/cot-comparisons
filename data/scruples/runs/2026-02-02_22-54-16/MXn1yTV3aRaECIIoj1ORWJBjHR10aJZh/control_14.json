My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with their wife eating from their plate when they're out. They mention being protective of their food, which they admit is a personal preference. They've tried setting boundaries like allowing a few bites, but the wife continues, leading to conflict.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. She eats from his plate despite his requests, and when he takes action (like giving her the plate), she feels insulted and starts a fight. She's upset that he's making a big deal out of it. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing a legitimate discomfort, and they've tried to communicate their needs. However, the way they handled it might have been harsh\u2014giving her the plate could come off as confrontational. The wife isn't respecting the boundary, which is the root of the problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to their own food and to set limits. However, the conflict arose from how they enforced the boundary. But the main issue is the wife not respecting the author's wishes. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The problem lies with the wife not honoring that boundary. So the answer is B (No).\n"
