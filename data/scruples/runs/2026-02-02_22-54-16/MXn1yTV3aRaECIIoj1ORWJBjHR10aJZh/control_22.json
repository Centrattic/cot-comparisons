My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married couple where the wife takes food from the husband's plate when they eat out. The husband is really bothered by this and it led to a fight. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband says he's very protective of his food, which he finds important because they ordered different things. He's okay with her having a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more, leading him to feel like he's competing for his own food. He's tried setting boundaries, like offering to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food, but she doesn't take the offer. He even mentions that when he gave her the plate, she got angry and felt insulted.\n\nOn the wife's side, she sees this as playful and cute. She might be sharing because she wants to bond or try new things, but she's not respecting his boundary about not taking from his plate. She might not realize how much it's affecting him, especially since she ends up eating most of his meal. The fight happened when he enforced his boundary by giving her the plate, which she took as him making her feel like a pig. She's now upset that he's making a big deal out of it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband is standing up for his personal boundary. He's communicated his feelings multiple times and tried to find solutions. The problem is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, which is causing conflict. Boundaries in relationships are important, and if one person isn't respecting the other's, that's where issues arise. The husband isn't wrong for wanting his food to be his own; it's about personal space and preferences. The wife, on the other hand, isn't respecting his boundaries, but the question is about the husband's actions. Since he's trying to communicate and set limits, he's not in the wrong here. The issue is more on the wife not respecting those limits, but the question is about the author's fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
