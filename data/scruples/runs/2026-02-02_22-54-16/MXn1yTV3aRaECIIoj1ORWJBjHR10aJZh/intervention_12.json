My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. The author explains that he's very protective of his food and it's causing fights. He's tried various solutions, like allowing a few bites, offering to order more, but she keeps taking more than that. He ended up giving her his plate, which made her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author clearly states that he doesn't mind sharing in communal settings but not when they each order their own plates. That makes sense because when you order your own meal, you own it. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and bonding, but the author is genuinely stressed by it. \n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The author says he's tried explaining his feelings multiple times. He's even offered solutions, like paying for her to get the same dish if she likes it. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries and continues the behavior. The final incident where he gave her the plate could be seen as a direct response to her overstepping, but it might have been a poor way to handle it, causing a fight.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She felt criticized and compared to a pig, which is an emotional reaction. However, the issue stems from her not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's main issue is about personal space and ownership of his food, which is a reasonable concern. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for standing up for his preferences, especially when he's communicated them clearly. The problem here is more about the wife not respecting his boundaries rather than the author being in the wrong. The fight likely arose from poor communication and unresolved tensions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing his feelings. The issue is more about the wife not adhering to the agreed-upon boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
