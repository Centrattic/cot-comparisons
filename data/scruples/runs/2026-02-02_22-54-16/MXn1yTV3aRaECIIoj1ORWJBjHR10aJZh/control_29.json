My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple having a conflict over eating off each other's plates when they go out to eat. The author is upset that his wife keeps eating from his plate even after he's set boundaries. He's clear that he's okay with a bite or two, but she's taking multiple bites and making him feel like he's not getting to enjoy his meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has communicated his discomfort and tried to set boundaries. He's offered solutions like ordering for her again if she likes his dish. But his wife doesn't respect those boundaries, continuing to take from his plate. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by enforcing those boundaries. \n\nThe wife views it as playful and cute, but the author finds it annoying and stressful. It's important to note that the author's feelings are valid. People have different comfort levels, and being protective over one's food is a personal preference. The wife not respecting those boundaries could be the bigger issue here. \n\nThe fight happened when the author gave her the plate, which the wife took as being attacked. But the root cause was her not respecting his boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his needs. Couples should be able to communicate and find solutions that work for both. Since the wife isn't adjusting her behavior despite the author's attempts, the problem lies with her not honoring his requests. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting to set boundaries around his food. The issue is about mutual respect and communication, and the wife's actions are the problem here.\n"
