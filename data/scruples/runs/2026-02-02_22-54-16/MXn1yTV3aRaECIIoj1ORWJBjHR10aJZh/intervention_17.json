My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is clearly uncomfortable with his wife eating from his plate when they go out to eat. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. This is causing him stress and even led to a fight. He feels his own meal is being taken from him, making him eat less. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, and she's upset when he gives her the plate, interpreting it as him making her feel like a pig.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. In many cultures, sharing food can be a sign of intimacy and trust. However, that doesn't mean someone can't have personal boundaries. The husband has a right to his own food, especially when he paid for it. The issue here is the balance between shared experiences and individual ownership.\n\nThe husband tried to communicate his boundaries and even offered compromises, like buying her the same dish. The fact that the wife didn't respect those boundaries despite the attempts shows that the problem isn't just the husband being difficult. He's consistent in his stance and only wants to share in a way that's agreeable to both. The wife's reaction to getting upset and not wanting to eat out anymore might indicate that she didn't take his feelings seriously enough.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the husband could have approached it differently, but given the context, he's made multiple attempts to resolve the issue without success. His actions during the fight\u2014giving her the plate\u2014seem like a last-ditch effort to enforce his boundaries, even if it came across as confrontational. However, his main issue is about his own comfort and respecting his choices, which is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband isn't in the wrong. He communicated his needs, tried to find solutions, and only escalated when boundaries were repeatedly crossed. The wife's behavior is the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
