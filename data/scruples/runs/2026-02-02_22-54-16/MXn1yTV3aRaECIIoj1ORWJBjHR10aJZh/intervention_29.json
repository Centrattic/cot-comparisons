My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with their wife eating from their plate when they order different items. They mention being protective of their food and that this has led to a fight. The wife seems to see it as playful and not a big deal. The author has tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites but not the whole meal, but the wife keeps taking more. The author ends up giving their plate to the wife, which made her upset. Now there's tension because they can't go to eat together anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal boundaries and differing expectations in a relationship. The author feels that their own ordered food is personal and should be respected. The wife, on the other hand, isn't considering that boundary and sees it as a bonding activity. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they're trying to communicate their needs and have been clear about what's acceptable. They've even offered solutions, like paying for her to get the same dish next time. The problem is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, leading to conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as a small, harmless thing, and the author making a big deal out of it. But in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014they just want their own food to themselves. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since they've tried to address it and the wife isn't complying, leading to the author feeling like they're competing for their own food, it seems the author is justified in wanting their boundary respected. The fight happened because the wife didn't respect that boundary, so the author isn't the one in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
