My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. I need to determine if the answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I should read through the situation carefully. The author is clearly annoyed because his wife keeps eating from his plate when they eat out. He's tried to set boundaries, allowing her a few bites, but she continues to take more. He feels it's his food because he ordered it himself, and it's making him uncomfortable. The situation escalated into a fight, and now the wife is upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On the author's side, he's expressing a personal boundary and preference. Protecting one's own food is a common sentiment, as seen in the Friends reference he mentions. He's tried to communicate his feelings and even offered solutions, but his wife hasn't respected those boundaries. This could be a valid reason for him to feel wronged.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might see sharing food as a way to bond or show affection. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. However, the fact that he's repeatedly asked her to stop and she continues could imply that she's not respecting his boundaries, which is a significant point.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and respect for boundaries. The author did communicate his feelings and tried to find compromises, but his wife either didn't listen or didn't take it seriously. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If someone repeatedly disrespects a partner's clearly stated boundary, that's a problem.\n\nThe fight arose when the wife continued to take bites despite the author's requests. The author's action of giving her the plate might have been a way to set a firm boundary, which could be seen as a last resort. The wife's reaction (feeling insulted and not wanting to eat out) might indicate that she didn't take the issue seriously, which could be on her part.\n\nHowever, sometimes in relationships, even if one person is right in their stance, the way it's handled can affect the outcome. The author's firm action of giving her the plate might have been too abrupt, leading to the fight. But the core issue is about respecting boundaries, which the wife hasn't done despite being told. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author established his boundaries and tried to resolve it, while the wife didn't respect those boundaries. So, the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
