My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He says he's really protective of his food, referencing the Friends episode where Ross gets mad. He's tried to communicate that he's okay with her having a couple bites, but she keeps taking way more, leading to him feeling like he's competing for his own food. The wife thinks it's playful and cute, but he ends up only half-full. The last straw happened when she took multiple bites of his food he was excited about, and he gave her the plate, which led to a fight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nThe author has expressed his feelings multiple times. He's given specific boundaries\u2014like one or two bites, offering to pay for her to get the same thing if she likes it. Despite that, she continues to take more. He's also tried to compromise by suggesting other ways they can bond over food without him feeling deprived. \n\nThe wife, on the other hand, seems to not take his boundaries seriously. She insists it's playful and even says she's not hungry but then eats his food. The conflict arises when she oversteps his limits, and he enforces them by taking away the plate, which makes her upset. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author has made his preferences clear. The issue is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. Even though the author's approach might come off as controlling if taken to an extreme, the wife's actions are the ones violating what he's communicated. \n\nThe fact that she's eating his food he paid for, and he's feeling deprived, suggests that his needs aren't being respected. However, it's also possible that the wife might feel he's being too strict, but the problem lies in her not honoring the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both parties respect each other's boundaries. If the author has clearly communicated his limits and the wife continues to ignore them, leading to conflict, then the fault might lie more with the wife. However, the author's response of giving her the plate might have been a harsh reaction. Maybe there could have been a different way to handle it, like removing the plate himself without giving it to her, but the main issue is the wife's behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs that he's communicated. The wife is the one not respecting his boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
