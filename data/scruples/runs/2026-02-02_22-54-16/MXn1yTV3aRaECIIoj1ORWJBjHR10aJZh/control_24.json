My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author finds this annoying and has even had a fight about it. He explains that he's tried to communicate his boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not treating his meal as shared. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear about how he feels: he's protective of his food and doesn't want someone else eating his meal. He's tried various solutions, like offering to order for her if she likes his food, but she keeps doing it. The fight happened when he gave her his plate, which she found upsetting. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, his main issue is that his personal space with food is being invaded. He values having his own meal and doesn't want to share it beyond a small bite. The wife's actions, while maybe seen as friendly or playful, are causing him distress. When he finally gives in and gives her the plate, it's to put an end to the situation, but it backfires and makes her feel targeted.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might see sharing food as a way to bond and show closeness. In some cultures or relationships, sharing food is a sign of intimacy. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. Her reaction to feeling like a pig seems to be an emotional response to his action of giving her the plate, which he did out of frustration.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated his feelings, which is important. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries despite the communication. However, the author's response (giving her the plate) might have been a harsh way to enforce that boundary, leading to the fight. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did express his feelings and tried to set boundaries. However, his reaction (giving the plate) might have been an overreaction, which could have contributed to the conflict. But the core issue is the wife not respecting his established boundaries. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting those boundaries. \n\nIn most cases, setting personal boundaries is okay, especially when communicated. The wife's actions are the main problem here. So the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop. But perhaps the way he enforced it could have been handled better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether both sides have valid points. \n\nSince the author tried to communicate and the wife isn't respecting that, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
