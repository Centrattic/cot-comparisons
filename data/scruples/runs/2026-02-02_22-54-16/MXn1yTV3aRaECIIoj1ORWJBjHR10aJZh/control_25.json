My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate when they're out to eat. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the situation. The author is uncomfortable with their wife eating off their plate when they've ordered different dishes. They mention being very protective of their food, similar to the Friends reference, which makes sense. The wife sees it as playful and cute, but the author finds it annoying and ends up not getting to eat their full meal. They've tried negotiating, offering to order more food for her, but it hasn't worked. The conflict escalated into a fight where the author gave the wife the plate, which made her upset. Now the wife is avoiding going out to eat.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's perspective is that they have a right to their own food, especially when they paid for it and ordered it themselves. They feel that sharing in this way isn't fair because it leaves them hungry and stressed. The wife's side is that she sees it as a form of bonding and playfulness, and she might not realize how much it's affecting the author. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has tried to communicate their feelings and set boundaries multiple times, which is good. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, leading to frustration. The author's actions in giving the wife the plate might have been a bit extreme, causing the fight, but their intention was to enforce their boundary. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife isn't respecting the author's clear boundaries, then the author isn't at fault for trying to assert their needs. However, the way the situation escalated could be a point of contention. The author's final action of giving the plate might have been a reasonable response given their prior communication, but it did lead to conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions might stem from a different cultural or personal norm where sharing food is a sign of closeness. The author's strictness could be seen as rigid, but they have a valid point about ownership of their meal. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking the wife to stop eating their food. They've communicated their needs and tried to find compromises. The wife's refusal to respect those boundaries is more of the issue here. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
