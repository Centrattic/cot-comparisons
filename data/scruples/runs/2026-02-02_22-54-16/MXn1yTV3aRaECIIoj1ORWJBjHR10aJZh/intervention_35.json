My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation involves the author being very protective of his food when they eat out, and his wife taking bites from his plate even after he's expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a clear boundary about not wanting his own food to be eaten by his wife, especially when they order different dishes. He's tried setting limits, like allowing a few bites, but she continues. This leads to conflict, culminating in a fight when he takes away his plate. The wife feels hurt and now doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe author's arguments are about personal boundaries and not wanting to share his ordered meal. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and a way to bond. The question is whether the author's actions are justified.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal boundaries, everyone has the right to their own space and belongings, including food. The author is communicating his discomfort and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The wife, however, isn't respecting those boundaries, which is problematic. The fact that the author has tried to compromise (offering to buy her the dish again) shows he's trying to find a middle ground. \n\nThe conflict arises when the author removes his plate, which might have been a harsh move, but it's a reaction to his repeated attempts being ignored. The wife's reaction\u2014feeling like a pig and not wanting to go out\u2014might stem from feeling criticized, but the core issue is her not respecting his boundary. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting his needs. The mistake might be in the approach, but the right itself is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
