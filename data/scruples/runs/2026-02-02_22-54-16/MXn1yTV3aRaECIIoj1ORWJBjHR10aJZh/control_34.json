My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels very protective of his food and it's causing them to fight. He's set boundaries but she's not respecting them. He's even offered solutions, like buying her food if she wants to try his, but she keeps taking from his plate. This is making him feel like he's competing for his own food, leading to stress and a fight.\n\nOn the wife's side, she seems to view the shared plate as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's affecting him. The argument escalated when he gave her the plate, which she took as being called a pig, even though he was just trying to enforce his boundary. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, personal boundaries are important. The husband has a right to his own food if he's paying for it and ordered it himself. He's communicated his feelings multiple times and tried to find compromises. The wife not respecting those boundaries despite the communication suggests she's the one overstepping. However, the husband's reaction of giving her the plate might have been a harsh move, possibly contributing to the fight. \n\nBut the core issue is about respecting personal space and boundaries. The husband isn't wrong for wanting his food to himself, especially given his sensitivity. The wife should be respecting his wishes, even if she sees it as harmless. The husband's actions were in response to repeated boundary violations, so he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No), as he's standing up for his own needs after trying to compromise.\n"
