My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat, which he finds really annoying and has caused a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly states that he's very protective of his own food, which is a personal preference. Sharing food can be a common thing in some relationships, but if one person is uncomfortable with it, that's a valid feeling. The wife seems to see it as playful and cute, but the author is genuinely bothered by it to the point of feeling like they're competing for food.\n\nThe author has tried to set boundaries, offering to pay for her to have her own meal if she likes his choice. That shows he's trying to accommodate her while respecting his own needs. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, which is leading to conflict. The fact that she continued taking bites even after he had already negotiated terms suggests she isn't respecting his limits.\n\nThe fight happened when he took the plate away, which made her feel targeted. But the root cause was her not adhering to the compromise he offered. The author's main issue is not about the food itself but about his personal space and autonomy regarding his meal. Since food is a basic need and personal property, it's reasonable for him to want to control how much he consumes. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife feels that sharing food is a way of bonding, which is a common social behavior. However, when it infringes on someone else's comfort, it becomes a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable in setting boundaries. The key here is mutual respect for each other's preferences. If she can't respect his boundaries, then the issue lies with her, not him. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to his own food without guilt, while trying to find a solution. The wife's actions are the ones that aren't respecting his boundaries, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
