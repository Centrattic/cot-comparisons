My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is really bothered by his wife eating off his plate when they go out. He's tried to set boundaries, allowing small bites but not treating his meal as shared. The wife, however, continues to take multiple bites, leading to a fight. The key points here are about personal boundaries, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe husband has communicated his feelings clearly, explaining that he wants his own food to be his. He's offered solutions, like ordering more if she wants to try something. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, which conflicts with his feelings. The fact that this led to a fight suggests that neither side completely understood the other's perspective.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The husband is expressing his needs and trying to maintain his personal space regarding food. It's reasonable for someone to have such a boundary, especially if it's causing him distress. The wife might not have realized the extent to which this was bothering him, but the husband has tried to communicate this multiple times. \n\nThe wife's actions might stem from a place of wanting to connect or share, but respecting the husband's boundaries is essential. The husband isn't being unreasonable by asking her to stop; he's asserting what's comfortable for him. The conflict arises because their needs aren't aligned on this issue. \n\nIn relationships, it's about finding a balance where both partners feel heard and respected. If the husband has made his feelings clear and the wife continues the behavior, leading to conflict, it's not entirely his fault. However, the wife's reaction (feeling targeted, not wanting to eat out anymore) shows that she's also upset. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. He's tried to find compromises, which shows he's willing to meet her halfway. The issue here is more about differing needs and ineffective communication. The fault isn't on one side alone. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
