My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly fed up because he's protective of his food and doesn't like sharing his meal. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a bite or two, but his wife keeps taking more. This has led to a fight. He's explaining that he wants to enjoy his own meal without feeling like he's competing for food. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. The author points out that she even eats his food when she says she's not hungry. He wants to be considerate by offering to buy her food if she likes it, but she doesn't take him up on it. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's trying to communicate his needs and set boundaries. He's not asking for anything unreasonable\u2014just to keep his own food to himself. The wife's actions, while maybe playful, are causing him distress. \n\nI need to consider if the author is overreacting. Some people might share food as a way of bonding, but if one person doesn't like it, it's a personal preference. The author isn't wrong for wanting his own food to himself. Relationships require compromise, and if he's made his feelings clear and she's not respecting that, the blame isn't entirely on him. \n\nThe key points are: the author has communicated his discomfort multiple times, tried solutions, and the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. The fight arose because of this ongoing issue. The author's actions in this situation are about standing up for his own needs, which is valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
