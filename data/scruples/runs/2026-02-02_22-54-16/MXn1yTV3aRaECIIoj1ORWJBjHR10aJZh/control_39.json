My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The situation is that the wife keeps taking bites from the author's plate when they order different dishes, which makes the author uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly upset because they feel their personal space (their food) is being invaded. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and a way to bond. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate their feelings, setting limits like allowing a couple of bites but not more. However, the wife isn't respecting that boundary, which leads to conflict. The author's actions\u2014giving the plate to the wife\u2014might have been a bit extreme, but their intention was to enforce their own boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions could be seen as a habit she's used to, not realizing how it affects the author. She might not have considered that the author is more protective of their food. However, once the author has communicated this, it becomes about respecting each other's preferences.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to acknowledge each other's feelings. The author isn't wrong for needing their own food to be their own. While arguing over food might seem trivial, it's a personal preference. The wife not respecting the boundary after being told is also her issue. The fight arose because the wife felt criticized, but the root is her not respecting the author's request.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The problem is the wife not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
