My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is asking if it's their fault (AITA) for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate when they eat out. The wife does this even when they order different dishes. The author is very protective of their food, which they mention is a \"Friends reference\" (probably the Ross and Rachel \"you know what's not fair?\" thing). The wife takes bites from his plate, says he can eat off hers, but he doesn't want to. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites and offering to reorder, but she doesn't listen. This leads to him feeling like he's competing for his own food, and they ended up in a fight. The wife is upset and now doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe author's side is that they've communicated their feelings multiple times, tried solutions, and are standing up for their personal boundaries. The wife sees it as playful but it's causing the author distress. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet me break this down. The key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author has clearly communicated their discomfort and tried to accommodate (like offering to pay for her to get the same meal). The wife, however, continues the behavior, which the author finds upsetting. The fight escalated because the author gave her the plate when she kept taking bites, leading to the wife feeling targeted and the author feeling unheard.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author is trying to maintain a personal boundary, which is valid. The wife's actions, while perhaps seen as affectionate or playful, are crossing that boundary. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for personal space with their food. The fact that the wife is now avoiding outings suggests there's some resentment, but the root cause is the ongoing disrespect of the author's boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author's response when giving her the plate might have been a mistake in how they handled it, causing the fight. But the core issue is whether the behavior itself is wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The wife might need to adjust her behavior to respect the author's feelings. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
