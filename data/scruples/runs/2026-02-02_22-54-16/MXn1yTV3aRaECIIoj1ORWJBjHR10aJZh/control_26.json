My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is uncomfortable with his wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. They've had arguments about it, and he's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites. He feels it's his own food when he orders it, and she's taking too much, making him feel like he's competing for his own meal. They ended up in a fight after he asked her again and gave her the plate, which upset her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and ownership over his own food. It's common for people to have different comfort levels here. Some might find it endearing when their partner shares food, while others feel it's a violation of their personal space. The author has tried to communicate his feelings and set boundaries, which is a healthy approach. He's even offered to pay for her to get her own meal if she likes what he orders.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees this as playful and cute, and the author's insistence might make her feel criticized or judged. The fight suggests that his approach, while well-intentioned, might be triggering her feelings. However, the author is clearly stating his needs, which is important in a relationship. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nIs there a wrongdoing here? The author isn't necessarily wrong for setting boundaries. People have different comfort levels, and he's trying to communicate his. The issue might be in how the boundaries are enforced or the communication style, but the act of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The wife's reaction is also a valid feeling, but the author's side is about his own comfort. \n\nSo, from a general perspective, setting personal boundaries isn't wrong. The problem might be more about how they're handling the conflict rather than the existence of the boundary itself. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
