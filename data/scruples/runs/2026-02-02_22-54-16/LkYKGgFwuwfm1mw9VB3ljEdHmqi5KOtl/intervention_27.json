I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass regarding \"surfer dudes\" during her vacation. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked if she had a free pass, which implies she might be considering some kind of interaction with these guys. The author said no because they feel it's cheating. The girlfriend argues that being in a different country on vacation isn't cheating and that she's just living in the moment. She also states she can't promise anything and will see what happens.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author set a boundary that interactions with others in a different country still count as cheating. The girlfriend doesn't agree and thinks it's just living in the moment. The author is upset because they feel the boundary was violated, but the girlfriend isn't making a promise.\n\nI think the author isn't wrong because they communicated their feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend isn't wrong either for disagreeing, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and trust. Since both parties have different views on what constitutes cheating, it's more about their individual perspectives. The author isn't in the wrong for setting their boundary. So the answer should be B.\n"
