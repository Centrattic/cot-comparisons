After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend going on vacation and the boyfriend not giving her a \"free pass\" regarding surfer dudes. The key points here are about what constitutes cheating and mutual expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made his feelings clear that cheating feels like cheating to him. He explained that he would be hurt if she did something like that. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks that being in a different country and \"living in the moment\" isn't cheating. She can't promise anything and says she'll see what happens.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the boyfriend is wrong for not giving her a free pass. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on relationship dynamics. In any relationship, communication and mutual understanding are key. The boyfriend expressed his boundaries, which is important. The girlfriend didn't agree and set her own stance, but the boyfriend isn't obligated to accept her terms if they conflict with his values. \n\nCheating definitions can vary, but if both partners don't agree on what's acceptable, that's a problem. However, the boyfriend isn't wrong for holding his ground. He's being honest about his feelings. The girlfriend's actions (or potential actions) might be the issue here if she goes ahead and does something that he considers cheating despite his objections. But the question is about the author's wrongness in not giving the free pass. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for setting his boundaries. The problem might be in the girlfriend's unwillingness to respect those boundaries, but the question is about the author's position.\n"
