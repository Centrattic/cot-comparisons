      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend's vacation and her asking if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The author says he doesn't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating. The girlfriend argues that being in another country and \"living in the moment\" isn't cheating for her, and she can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are about boundaries in relationships, mutual expectations, and communication.\n\nThe author set a boundary by saying he wouldn't give her a free pass. The girlfriend's response is that she can't promise anything and will see what happens. The author feels hurt and broken if she does something he considers cheating. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms, both parties should have clear expectations. The author's stance is based on his feelings about cheating, which is valid. The girlfriend's perspective is more about living in the moment, which might be her way of experiencing the vacation. However, the fact that she can't promise anything might indicate a mismatch in their expectations. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the author communicated his feelings clearly and she still proceeds without commitment, that could be seen as disregarding his feelings. However, if the author hasn't discussed what he considers cheating beforehand, maybe he's contributing to the misunderstanding. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of not making promises might be her way of staying authentic, but it could also be seen as not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's pain is valid, but if he hasn't established clear boundaries early on, he might share some responsibility. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he communicated his feelings and she still went ahead with her plan, the onus might be more on her. But the author's right to feel hurt is clear. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who has the higher ground. Here, the author isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries. The girlfriend is the one not committing to respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
