After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The author says they don't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating. The girlfriend argues that since they're in another country and on vacation, it's \"living in the moment\" and she can't promise anything. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the morality here. Cheating is subjective. Some people see being physically present with someone else as cheating, others don't. The author's perspective is that any form of that interaction is cheating, while the girlfriend sees it as acceptable as it's a vacation in another country.\n\nThe key points: The author set a boundary by not giving a free pass, the girlfriend isn't respecting that boundary by saying she can't promise anything. The author is hurt by this, which is valid. The girlfriend's argument is about context, but if the relationship has established boundaries against such interactions, then her actions cross that line.\n\nCheating definitions vary, but the author's feelings are valid. If the girlfriend is okay with potential interactions that the author sees as cheating, there's a mismatch in expectations. The author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend is in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
