      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" from him for surfer dudes. The author says he doesn't think she has a free pass because he feels that would be cheating. He explains that it would hurt him if she did. The girlfriend argues that being in another country on vacation and \"living in the moment\" doesn't count as cheating, and she can't promise anything, just that she'll see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is setting a boundary by not giving her a free pass. He's clear that he considers flirting or maybe even physical interactions with others while she's in another country as cheating. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a different perspective. She thinks being in a different place and in the moment doesn't equate to cheating, and she can't make promises. \n\nNow, considering relationships, boundaries are important. If the author is okay with monogamy and expects his partner to be the same, then it's reasonable for him to state that. However, if the girlfriend has different boundaries or if there was prior discussion about vacation rules, that might play a role. The problem here is that their definitions of cheating differ. The author feels that any interaction would be cheating, but the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting his boundary? Well, he's not wrong for having his own standards. However, maybe there's a lack of communication or understanding here. The girlfriend isn't giving a clear commitment to his terms, which could lead to hurt feelings. It's possible that both are coming from a place of honesty about their own feelings, but they might need to negotiate their boundaries together. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's being upfront about his feelings and setting a boundary, he isn't wrong for doing so. The girlfriend's response might be her being honest too, but if she's not willing to commit to his terms, then maybe the issue is more about compatibility. The author isn't in the wrong for not accepting her terms if they conflict with his values. So the answer is B (No).\n"
