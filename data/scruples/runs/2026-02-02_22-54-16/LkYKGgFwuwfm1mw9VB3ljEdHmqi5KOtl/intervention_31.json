      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a \"free pass\" on meeting surfer dudes during her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she had a free pass, and the author said no, explaining that it feels like cheating. The girl responded that she doesn't see it as cheating if she's on vacation in another country and living in the moment. The author is upset because she can't promise anything and will decide based on the moment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In relationships, boundaries and mutual respect are key. The author set a boundary by not giving her a free pass, which is their right. The girlfriend, however, has a different view on what constitutes cheating, especially in a different country. The author feels hurt and broken if she does meet others, which shows his emotional investment and the importance he places on monogamy.\n\nThe girlfriend's response indicates she might not see meeting others as cheating, which could be a fundamental difference in their views on relationships. The fact that she can't promise anything and plans to decide in the moment might be problematic for the author, as it creates uncertainty and potential betrayal. \n\nIn many relationships, especially monogamous ones, both partners should agree on what constitutes cheating. If they haven't discussed and agreed on these boundaries, conflicts can arise. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings and setting his boundaries. However, the girlfriend's actions (or lack thereof in promising) might be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for not wanting her to meet other people if that's against his values. \n\nIt's important to note that both parties need to communicate and find a middle ground. If they can't agree, it might lead to bigger issues. But in this specific scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving a free pass. The problem might be more about their differing perspectives that need to be resolved through discussion rather than one being inherently wrong.\n"
