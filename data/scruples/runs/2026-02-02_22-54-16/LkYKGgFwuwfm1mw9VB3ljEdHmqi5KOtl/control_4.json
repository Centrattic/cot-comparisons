After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for surfer dudes, and the author said no, explaining it feels like cheating. She responded that she thinks it's not cheating if you're on vacation in another country, living in the moment, and can't promise anything, just see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The author set a boundary by saying it feels like cheating. The girlfriend isn't respecting that boundary, thinking it's okay to be \"in the moment\" on vacation. \n\nCheating definitions can vary, but generally, it's about betrayal. If the author considers any romantic/sexual interaction with someone else as cheating, then the girlfriend is crossing that line. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The girlfriend's response is dismissive of the author's feelings, which is problematic. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. Since the author communicated their feelings clearly and the girlfriend isn't honoring that, the author isn't wrong. The issue is the girlfriend's lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
