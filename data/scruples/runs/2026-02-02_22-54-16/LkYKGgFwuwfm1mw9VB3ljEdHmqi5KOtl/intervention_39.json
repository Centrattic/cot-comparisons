I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" from him for surfer dudes. The author says no because they feel it's cheating, and the girlfriend argues that since she's in another country on vacation, it's just \"living in the moment\" and can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is setting boundaries and expressing their feelings about cheating. They feel hurt and wouldn't be okay with it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to think that her actions in a different country aren't cheating, and she can't make promises.\n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is clear about their boundaries, which is important. The girlfriend's response suggests she might not be respecting those boundaries, as she can't commit to not acting on her impulses. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving that free pass. \n\nCheating definitions can vary between partners, but the author's feelings are valid. They have the right to express discomfort. The girlfriend's stance might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for having those feelings or setting those limits. The problem might be more on the girlfriend's side for not respecting the boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
