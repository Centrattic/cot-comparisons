      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend is going to another country and mentioned surfer dudes, implying she might consider flirting or hooking up. The author says he doesn't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating. He explained that it would hurt him, and she responded by saying she sees it differently because it's living in the moment and can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author set a boundary and expressed his feelings, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's response suggests she has different expectations, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. Cheating is often defined by the boundaries both parties agree on. If the author clearly communicated that any interaction with others would be a problem, then he's not in the wrong for setting that standard. However, if they hadn't discussed expectations beforehand, there might be a mutual misunderstanding. But based on the info given, the author stood his ground on his feelings, which is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
