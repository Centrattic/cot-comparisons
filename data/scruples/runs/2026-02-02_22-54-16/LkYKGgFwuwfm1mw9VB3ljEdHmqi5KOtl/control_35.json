After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding surfer dudes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a free pass from the author. The author says no, considering it cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if it's in another country and about living in the moment. She also says she can't promise anything and will see what happens in the moment.\n\nSo, the author is upset because they feel like their boundaries aren't respected. The key points here are mutual respect in a relationship, trust, and agreed-upon boundaries. The author set a boundary that they consider any infidelity as cheating, even in a vacation context. The girlfriend, however, has a different perspective, thinking it's okay in that specific scenario.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have clear and mutual understanding of what is acceptable. If the author communicated their feelings and boundaries clearly, then the girlfriend's response might indicate a lack of respect for those boundaries. However, the girlfriend's stance is about personal freedom and spontaneity, which might be a cultural or personal difference.\n\nBut if the agreement is that no infidelity is allowed under any circumstances, then the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The girlfriend's response that she can't promise anything and will act on the moment suggests she might not adhere to the same standards, which could be a red flag.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for not giving a free pass. The issue lies in whether both parties have agreed on the same expectations. If the girlfriend is unwilling to respect the author's boundaries, that's on her, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
