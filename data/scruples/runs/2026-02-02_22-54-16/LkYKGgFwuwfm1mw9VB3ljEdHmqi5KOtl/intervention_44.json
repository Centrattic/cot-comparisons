      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for \"surfer dudes,\" which I assume means if she can flirt or be with other guys without consequences. The author says they don't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating. They explained that it would hurt them if she did that. The girlfriend responded that she thinks it's not cheating if you're in another country on vacation and \"living in the moment.\" She can't promise to stay away from others and will see what happens.\n\nThe user is wondering if they're the one at fault. I need to decide between A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author set a boundary by not giving a free pass. The girlfriend's actions and responses suggest she has different boundaries. She's okay with being in a different country and engaging in momentary interactions, which she doesn't see as cheating. The author, however, sees that as cheating and is hurt by the idea. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If both partners agree on the terms, it's clear. But when there's a mismatch, it can lead to conflict. The author expressed their feelings and boundaries upfront, which is healthy. The girlfriend's response indicates she doesn't share those boundaries, which might mean the relationship has fundamental disagreements about what's acceptable behavior outside the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting a boundary. In my opinion, setting clear expectations is not wrong. The issue might be more about compatibility. The author isn't at fault for not giving a free pass. The girlfriend's actions might be the problem if she's not respecting the author's boundaries. However, the author also needs to consider if the relationship is healthy if the girlfriend can't commit to the same standards.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the author already communicated their stance. The girlfriend's response shows she doesn't respect that boundary. The author isn't wrong for having those feelings or setting that limit. The problem lies in the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
