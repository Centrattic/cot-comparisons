I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass regarding potential interactions with surfer dudes during her vacation.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass, meaning she might be considering casual or non-committal interactions with others while on vacation. The author refuses, stating that it feels like cheating and that he would be hurt. The girlfriend counters that being on vacation in another country allows her to \"live in the moment\" and can't promise not to engage in such interactions.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to confirm. So, the core issue is about boundaries in a relationship. The author set their boundary (not giving a free pass), and the girlfriend is not respecting that boundary by implying she might not adhere to it. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect for boundaries are crucial. The author expressed their feelings and boundaries clearly. The girlfriend's response indicates she might not agree with the author's definition of cheating, but her willingness to act on her own terms could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. However, the situation might highlight a deeper issue about their compatibility regarding expectations in the relationship. But based on the question, the focus is on whether the author is at fault. Since the author communicated their stance and the girlfriend is now not respecting it, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B.\n"
