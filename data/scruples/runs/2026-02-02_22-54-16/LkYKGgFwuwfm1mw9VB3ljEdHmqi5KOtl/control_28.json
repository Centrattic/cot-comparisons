I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a \"free pass\" regarding surfer dudes during her vacation. The girlfriend thinks that being in another country on vacation and \"living in the moment\" means it's not cheating. The author feels that this crosses a line into cheating and is hurt by her response.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend is setting a boundary by saying she can't promise not to interact with surfer dudes, while the author is asserting that such interactions are cheating. The girlfriend's stance is more permissive, but the author feels betrayed by her lack of commitment to avoid those situations.\n\nIn relationships, communication about what constitutes cheating is crucial. If the author feels that any interaction with potential romantic interests is cheating, then the girlfriend's approach doesn't align with those boundaries. The author's hurt is valid because trust and mutual respect are foundational. The girlfriend's \"living in the moment\" justification might be her way of handling the situation, but if it conflicts with the author's needs, then there's a disconnect in their expectations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing their boundary. Since both partners need to agree on what's acceptable, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. However, there's a communication gap that needs resolution. The author's position is about maintaining trust, which is reasonable. The girlfriend not honoring those boundaries could be where the issue lies, but the author isn't at fault for setting them.\n"
