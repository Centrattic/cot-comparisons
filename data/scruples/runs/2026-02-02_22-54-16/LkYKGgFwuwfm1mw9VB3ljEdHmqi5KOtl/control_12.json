      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an AITA (Am I the Asshole) for not giving their girlfriend a free pass regarding surfer dudes during her vacation. The girlfriend asked if she had a free pass, and the user said no, because it feels like cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if you're in another country on vacation and \"living in the moment.\" She can't promise anything and says she'll see what happens.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The user is a committed partner who has boundaries about their girlfriend not being with others. The girlfriend feels that during a vacation, especially in a different country, engaging with surfer dudes isn't cheating. The user feels hurt and broken at the thought of this, but the girlfriend isn't making any promises to stay faithful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI think it's important to look at consent and mutual expectations in a relationship. Typically, in a monogamous relationship, both partners agree not to engage in romantic or sexual activities with others. The user is setting a boundary that the girlfriend isn't respecting. However, the girlfriend might feel that the user is being too restrictive, considering the context of being on vacation. But the user's feelings of betrayal are valid because they see it as cheating. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend isn't in a monogamous relationship if she's okay with this. However, the user's perspective is that they are in a monogamous relationship. If that's the case, then the girlfriend's actions would indeed be a violation. However, if the relationship isn't monogamous, then the user might have the issue. But the user's statement suggests that they see it as cheating, implying monogamy. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about \"living in the moment\" and the vacation setting might be her way of justifying her actions, but from the user's perspective, they've already set their boundaries. If the girlfriend isn't willing to respect those boundaries, that could be a problem. But the user isn't the one breaking the agreement; they're the one upholding their agreed-upon terms. \n\nHowever, maybe the user didn't clearly define the relationship's boundaries beforehand. If the relationship was supposed to be monogamous, then the user isn't in the wrong for enforcing that. But if there was ambiguity, maybe the girlfriend thought it was okay. But the user's reaction suggests they expected monogamy, so the girlfriend's lack of commitment to that is the issue here.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the user is standing by their values and boundaries. The girlfriend is the one not honoring the agreed-upon terms. So the author isn't in the wrong because they're sticking to their word and the expectations of the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
