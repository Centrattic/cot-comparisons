After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author (AITA) is wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass regarding \"surfer dudes\" while she's on vacation. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend is going on a vacation in another country and asked if she has a free pass. The author says no, explaining that it feels like cheating. The girlfriend argues that being in another country and in the moment doesn't count as cheating, and she can't promise not to act on the moment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they set clear boundaries and communicated their feelings about cheating. That's important in any relationship. They expressed that the thought of their girlfriend being with someone else would hurt them. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, has a different view. She believes that being in a different location and acting on impulse isn't cheating. However, she's not committing to anything, which is confusing because she's not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. The author clearly communicated their stance, so they're not in the wrong for upholding their boundaries. The girlfriend's response shows she's not taking the author's feelings seriously, which is on her side. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving a free pass. They have the right to define what cheating means to them and expect their partner to respect that.\n"
