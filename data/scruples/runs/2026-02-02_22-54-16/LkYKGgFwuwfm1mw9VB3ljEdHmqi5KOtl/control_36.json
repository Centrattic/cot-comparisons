I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on surfer dudes during her vacation. The girlfriend wanted to be open to meeting locals, and the author felt that would be cheating. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their feelings about not being okay with what the girlfriend considers \"living in the moment\" while on vacation. The girlfriend responded that she can't promise anything and might act on the moment. So the main issue is whether the author is wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author isn't being controlling; they're expressing their personal boundaries. Cheating definitions can vary between partners, but if the author feels it's cheating, then respecting that is necessary. The girlfriend might not see it the same way, but that's her perspective. The author isn't wrong for standing by their beliefs. The answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for setting clear expectations and respecting their own feelings about fidelity. The girlfriend's response shows she's not committed to the same boundaries, which could lead to bigger issues, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
