      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes from him. The author says he doesn't give her a free pass because it feels like cheating to him. The girlfriend argues that since she's in another country and it's vacation, it's about living in the moment, and she can't promise anything, just that she'll see what happens.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants an answer A or B, where A is yes (author is wrong) and B is no (author isn't wrong).\n\nLet me think about relationships and boundaries. In a committed relationship, trust and communication are key. The author set a boundary by saying he wouldn't give her a free pass because he views that behavior as cheating. He also expressed his feelings of being broken if she did it. That seems reasonable. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a different perspective, seeing it as living in the moment and not cheating, but she also can't promise anything. This might be a conflict in their definitions of cheating and boundaries.\n\nIn such cases, it's important for both partners to discuss and agree on what is acceptable. If the girlfriend went ahead and engaged in behavior the author considers cheating, he has the right to feel betrayed. But the question here is about whether he was wrong for not giving her a free pass. I think his stance is about maintaining trust and respecting his own boundaries. The girlfriend's response indicates she might not share those boundaries, but that doesn't make his position wrong. It's more about differing expectations. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit often looks at whether someone crossed a line. Here, the author hasn't done anything; he's expressing his feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend's actions (or lack thereof) might be the issue if she proceeds to act. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
