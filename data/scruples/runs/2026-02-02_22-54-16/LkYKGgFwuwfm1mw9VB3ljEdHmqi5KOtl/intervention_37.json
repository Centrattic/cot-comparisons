I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving his girlfriend a \"free pass\" on her vacation regarding surfer dudes. The key points here are the definitions of cheating and the expectations in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked if she has a free pass, implying she might engage in certain behavior. The author says no because he views it as cheating. He explains that it would hurt him. The girlfriend counters by saying vacation in another country isn't cheating for her, being \"in the moment,\" and can't promise anything. \n\nNow, relationships vary, and boundaries are personal. If the author set clear boundaries beforehand, he's not wrong to enforce them. Cheating definitions can be subjective, but trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's response shows a lack of commitment to his boundaries, which could be problematic. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings and setting limits. The issue might lie more with the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
