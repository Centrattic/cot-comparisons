I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they're at fault for not giving their girlfriend a \"free pass\" on meeting up with surfer dudes during her vacation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered cheating in their relationship. Cheating definitions can vary between couples. Some might consider any physical or emotional intimacy outside the relationship as cheating, while others might have different boundaries. The author feels that meeting surfer dudes is cheating, while the girlfriend doesn't, especially since she's in another country. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is about \"living in the moment,\" which might imply she's more open to spontaneous interactions. However, the author is hurt and feels betrayed if she does this. Communication is key here. The author clearly communicated their boundaries, which is something important in any relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's response, saying she can't promise anything, might indicate a lack of respect for the author's feelings. If she knows this upsets him, but still plans to act on her impulses, that's a problem. Boundaries should be respected unless both parties agree to renegotiate them. \n\nAlso, the location part\u2014being in another country\u2014doesn't inherently make it not cheating. Cheating isn't about geography but about the nature of the interactions. If they're in a monogamous relationship, any action that either sees as cheating should be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nSo, the author setting a boundary isn't wrong. The girlfriend, on the other hand, not respecting those boundaries by not making promises and acting on her impulses might be the issue. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by his feelings and boundaries. The problem might be that the girlfriend isn't respecting his perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
