After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend going on vacation and the guy not giving her a \"free pass\" on flirting with surfer dudes. The girl thinks that since she's in another country on vacation, it's okay to \"live in the moment\" and he's upset because he feels that's cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"free pass\" means here. It sounds like the girlfriend is asking if he's okay with her potentially flirting or being physically intimate with others, and he's saying no. The key issue is about boundaries in a relationship. The author is upset because he believes his girlfriend's behavior would be cheating, while she doesn't see it that way, especially in a different country and during a vacation.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial and usually agreed upon by both partners. What one person considers okay, the other might not. The author has made it clear that he wouldn't be okay with her doing that, so if she goes ahead anyway, he's justified in feeling hurt. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the free pass.\n\nI think the answer depends on mutual consent and the agreements both partners have. If the relationship is monogamous and the girlfriend is considering actions that the author deems as cheating, then the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The girlfriend might need to respect his feelings here. However, if the girlfriend feels that the author is being too controlling without clear prior boundaries, that could be a different angle. But based on the information given, the author is expressing his feelings and boundaries, which is his right. The girlfriend's response of not being able to promise anything suggests she might not be willing to respect those boundaries, which could be an issue in the relationship. So the author isn't in the wrong for not giving the free pass; the issue is more about the girlfriend's willingness to honor his feelings.\n"
