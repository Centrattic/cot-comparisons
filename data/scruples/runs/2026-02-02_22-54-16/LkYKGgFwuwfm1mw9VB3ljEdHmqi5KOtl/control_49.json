      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" regarding surfer dudes. The author says they don't give her a free pass because they see it as cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if she's in another country on vacation and \"living in the moment,\" and she can't promise anything, just going to see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the definition of cheating and mutual boundaries in a relationship. Cheating typically involves emotional or physical intimacy with someone outside the relationship, which both partners have agreed not to do. The girlfriend's argument is that being in another country and in the moment doesn't make it cheating, but the author feels hurt and broken if she does that.\n\nThe author is setting a boundary by not giving a free pass, which is reasonable. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is not respecting that boundary by saying she can't commit to anything and will just see what happens. Communication is crucial here. The author expressed their feelings, but the girlfriend isn't reciprocating the respect for those boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with potential cheating, that's a red flag. However, the author isn't at fault for setting their limits. The problem seems to be on the girlfriend's side for not honoring the agreed-upon boundaries. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
