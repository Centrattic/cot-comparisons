I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about the girlfriend going on vacation and the author not giving her a \"free pass\" for surfer dudes. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if she's in another country on vacation and wants to live in the moment. The author feels that would be cheating and is hurt by her response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of a relationship. Cheating is typically about violating agreed-upon terms. If the couple has an open relationship, then maybe different rules apply. But the user didn't mention anything about an open relationship, so it's safer to assume they're in a monogamous one.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that being in another country and in the moment isn't cheating. But from the author's perspective, any romantic or sexual interaction with someone else would be cheating, regardless of location. The key here is communication. The author expressed his feelings and set a boundary. The girlfriend, however, is not respecting that boundary and is being noncommittal about her actions, which could lead to betrayal.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he communicated his boundaries and expects his partner to respect them. The girlfriend's response indicates she doesn't see it the same way, which is her choice, but the author isn't wrong for having his own standards. The issue is more on her not respecting his feelings and the established boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
