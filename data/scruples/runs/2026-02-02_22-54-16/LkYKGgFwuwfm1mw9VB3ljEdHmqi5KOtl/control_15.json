      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation, specifically regarding interactions with surfer dudes.\n\nFirst, the author set boundaries by saying they don't give a free pass because it feels like cheating. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks that being in another country and \"living in the moment\" means it's not cheating. She also can't promise anything and says she'll see what happens.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and expectations in a relationship. The author clearly communicated their feelings about cheating, which is a valid stance. The girlfriend has a different perspective, but the author isn't obligated to accept that. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author's rules, maybe there's a deeper issue about trust or the relationship's dynamics. However, the author isn't wrong for standing by their beliefs. The girlfriend's inability to commit to not seeing others while on vacation could be a red flag, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author is honest about their feelings and hasn't done anything to violate the relationship, they aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
