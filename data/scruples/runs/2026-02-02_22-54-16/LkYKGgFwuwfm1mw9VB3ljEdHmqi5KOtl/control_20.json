      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend going on vacation and being given a \"free pass\" by her partner regarding interactions with surfer dudes. The author says they don't give a free pass because they feel it's cheating. The girlfriend argues that being in another country and in the moment isn't cheating, and she can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what cheating means in a relationship. Boundaries vary between couples. The author's stance is that any interaction that could be seen as cheating is off-limits. The girlfriend's view is more about the context\u2014being in a different country and living in the moment. The key here is mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. If the couple hasn't clearly defined boundaries, this can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe author's concern is valid because they expressed their feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend's response indicates she might not share the same boundaries, which could lead to future issues. The author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. However, the girlfriend's inability to commit to not engaging with others might be a deal-breaker. The author is within their right to expect monogamy unless otherwise agreed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving a free pass.\n"
