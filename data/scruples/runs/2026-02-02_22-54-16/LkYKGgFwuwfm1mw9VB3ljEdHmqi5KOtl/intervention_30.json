I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend is going on vacation and asked if she has a \"free pass\" from the author regarding surfer dudes. The author says no because he feels that would be cheating. The girlfriend argues that since she's in another country and on vacation, it's about living in the moment and she can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Trust and boundaries are crucial in any partnership. The author communicated his feelings about cheating and what he's okay with. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is suggesting that her actions while on vacation don't count as cheating because of the location and spontaneity. But the author clearly expressed that this would hurt him.\n\nThe key here is mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. If the relationship is monogamous, then both parties should agree on what behaviors are off-limits. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing his discomfort. The girlfriend isn't necessarily wrong either if she believes her actions don't breach those boundaries, but there's a disconnect here. The author's boundaries haven't been respected, which could lead to hurt feelings. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he communicated his stance and the girlfriend is disregarding that, the fault isn't on the author. The problem arises from the girlfriend not respecting his feelings and boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
