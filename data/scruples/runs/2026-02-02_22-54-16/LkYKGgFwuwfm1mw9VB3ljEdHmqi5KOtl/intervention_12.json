After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The girlfriend wanted to engage with surfer dudes, considering it \"living in the moment\" because she's on vacation in another country. The author feels that's cheating and can't handle it, leading to the girlfriend not being able to promise anything and leaving it to the moment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author set boundaries by not allowing a free pass, which is about their own comfort with what they consider cheating. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a different perspective, seeing her actions as within bounds because of the vacation context. \n\nThe key here is about mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating. If the relationship is monogamous and the author's definition includes any interaction that could be seen as romantic or flirtatious with others, then the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. The girlfriend's stance is based on her own interpretation, but if they didn't discuss and agree on these terms beforehand, it's the girlfriend who might be overstepping the author's boundaries.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response about not being able to promise anything shows a lack of commitment to the author's boundaries. This could lead to hurt feelings if she acts on her impulses. The author's concern about being broken if she does this suggests that the girlfriend's approach is dismissive of his feelings, which is a problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving a free pass. They communicated their feelings and boundaries. The issue lies more with the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries and being unclear about her own intentions. The author's stance is about maintaining trust and the integrity of their relationship as they see it.\n"
