After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving his girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding surfer dudes. The girlfriend asked if she has a free pass, and the author said no because he feels it's cheating. She thinks it's just living in the moment since she's in another country on vacation. The author is upset because she can't promise him anything and plans to see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. From a relationship perspective, trust and boundaries are key. The author set a boundary by stating he doesn't consider that behavior okay. The girlfriend's response suggests she's open to acting on impulse, which might cross the author's boundaries. The author's feeling of being broken if she does it shows his emotional investment and how her actions would affect him. \n\nCheating is subjective. Some couples have open relationships, but others don't. The author didn't give a free pass, which means he's clear about his expectations. The girlfriend's inability to promise anything might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries. If the author expected exclusivity, then her attitude could be problematic. However, the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. The issue might lie in communication\u2014maybe they didn't discuss their expectations beforehand. The author isn't at fault for standing by his values. So, the answer should be B.\n"
