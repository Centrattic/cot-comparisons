After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\".

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's cheating for the girlfriend to interact with other guys on vacation, especially since she's in a different country.\n\nFirst, the author of the post (AITA) doesn't give his girlfriend a free pass, meaning he considers any interaction with other men as cheating. He explains that it would hurt him if she did that. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks that being in a different country and \"living in the moment\" doesn't count as cheating. She can't promise not to interact with others and will decide based on the moment.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is mutual understanding and agreement in a relationship. If both partners have different definitions of cheating, that's a communication issue. The author has his boundaries, and the girlfriend isn't respecting those. Cheating definitions can vary, but if one partner is uncomfortable with certain behaviors, both should agree on what's acceptable. The author isn't wrong for expressing his boundaries. However, the problem might be that the girlfriend isn't honoring those boundaries, which could indicate deeper issues. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. Since he's standing by his definition and communicated it, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend is the one not respecting the agreed-upon terms. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
