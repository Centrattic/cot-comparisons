After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The situation is that the girlfriend asked if she had a free pass for \"surfer dudes\" while on vacation, and the author said no, because it feels like cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if you're in another country and \"living in the moment,\" and can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nCheating is often defined by the boundaries both partners agree on. If the author and girlfriend have different definitions of cheating, that's a problem. The author sees any interaction with others as cheating, while the girlfriend thinks it's okay if it's consensual and in another country. The key here is communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author set a boundary and expressed their feelings, which is healthy. The girlfriend is not respecting that boundary by saying she can't promise anything. In a relationship, trust and agreed-upon rules are crucial. If one partner is okay with the other flirting or dating others, that's their choice, but the author isn't. The author isn't wrong for having those feelings or setting that boundary. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be the one in the wrong if she agreed to the boundary but now is disregarding it.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in setting boundaries and expressing that certain actions are unacceptable. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here if she's not honoring those boundaries. The author isn't wrong for holding their stance.\n"
