      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA question). The situation is about a girlfriend going on vacation and asking if she has a \"free pass\" for \"surfer dudes,\" meaning maybe she's considering flirting or hooking up with someone else. The author says they don't give her a free pass because they see it as cheating. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if you're in another country and living in the moment. She can't promise anything and says she'll see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about consent and boundaries in relationships. The author set a boundary by saying they don't give her a free pass. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being too controlling, but the author's reasoning is that they'd feel broken if she cheated. The girlfriend's perspective is that she's in a different country and acting in the moment, which she doesn't see as cheating. However, cheating is often defined by the mutual agreement between partners. If the author didn't agree to this, then the girlfriend's actions would be against the terms of their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for setting that boundary. In relationships, it's normal for partners to have different boundaries. The author is expressing their discomfort and setting a limit, which is their right. The girlfriend's response shows she doesn't agree with those limits, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is not in the wrong for establishing their boundaries. The girlfriend's inability to commit to not acting on her impulses might indicate a bigger issue in the relationship, but the author's stance is valid.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
