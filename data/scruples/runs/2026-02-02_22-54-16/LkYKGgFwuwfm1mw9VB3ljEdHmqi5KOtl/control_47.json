      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation regarding interactions with surfer dudes. The girlfriend thinks it's not cheating if you're on vacation in another country and \"living in the moment,\" and she can't promise anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author set a boundary by not giving a free pass, which is their right in a relationship. The girlfriend is okay with engaging in potentially compromising situations, but the author sees that as cheating. The girlfriend's stance is that being in a different country and living in the moment makes it okay, and she can't commit to avoiding it. \n\nSo, the main issue is differing values and boundaries. The author is feeling hurt and concerned about cheating, while the girlfriend has different views. The question is whether the author is wrong for not allowing this.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries vary. If the author communicated their feelings and the girlfriend still insists on her actions, it's about mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for setting their boundary. The girlfriend's inability to promise isn't the author's fault. The author's feelings are valid here. The wrong here might be on the girlfriend for not respecting the boundary, but the question is about the author. Since the author is standing by their values and communicated their stance, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
