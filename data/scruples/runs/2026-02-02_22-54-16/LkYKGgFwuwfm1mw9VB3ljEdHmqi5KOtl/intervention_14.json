I told her I don't give her a free pass for this because to me it feels like cheating. After explaining that I would be broken if she would do it she told me she thinks it isn't cheating to her if you are on vacation and in another country because \"it is living in the moment\". At the end she told me she can't promise me anything and she is just gonna see there what see will do in the moment.\n\nPlease help me reddit, AITA because I've been feeling like it for the last few days\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not giving their girlfriend a free pass on her vacation. The situation is that the girlfriend asked if she has a free pass for \"surfer dudes\" while on vacation. The author said no, because it feels like cheating to him. She responded that to her, it's not cheating if she's in another country and \"living in the moment,\" and she can't promise anything because she'll see what happens in the moment.\n\nSo the key points here are about boundaries and mutual expectations in a relationship. The author communicated that he wouldn't be okay with her being with other people, even on vacation. The girlfriend, however, has a different perspective, thinking that in a different location, it's not cheating. The problem is the mismatch in their definitions of cheating and their expectations.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings and boundaries. It's important in a relationship that partners communicate their needs and boundaries. If the girlfriend can't respect his boundaries, that might be an issue. However, the author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. The girlfriend's response indicates she might have different expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong for stating his position.\n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies more with the girlfriend not respecting his boundaries, not the author setting them. It's about mutual agreement, and if she can't commit to that, maybe the relationship needs to be evaluated, but the author isn't at fault for expressing his stance.\n"
