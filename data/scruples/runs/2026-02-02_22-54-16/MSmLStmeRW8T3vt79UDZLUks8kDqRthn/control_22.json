      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is framed as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a groom who altered a bridesmaid's hair color in over 600 wedding photos. The bridesmaid showed up with an iridescent blue hair color, which the groom found unexpected or inappropriate for a wedding. He then edited the photos to change her hair back to a natural color.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and the reasonableness of the action. Did the bridesmaid agree to have her hair altered? If not, then the groom might be overstepping by changing her appearance without permission. However, since these are personal photos taken at their own wedding, there's an argument that the groom has some control over how the photos are presented, especially if it's part of the wedding album they're creating together.\n\nOn the other hand, editing someone's appearance without their consent could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. The bridesmaid might have chosen the blue hair as an expression of her personal style, and altering it could be seen as dismissing her choice. However, the groom might argue that the blue hair was unexpected and clashed with the wedding's formality, hence the edit.\n\nThe humor in the original question (\"it was fun\") might suggest that the groom isn't taking it too seriously, but the core issue is about respect for personal choices versus the desire to curate the wedding photos. There's a balance between personal expression and the expectations of a formal event like a wedding. Some might argue that guests should dress appropriately for the occasion, while others believe that personal style should be respected regardless.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not uncommon for people to request certain dress codes for events, but in this case, the bridesmaid chose her own style. The groom's reaction could stem from a desire to maintain a cohesive look in the photos, which is understandable. However, the act of editing without consent could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on whether the groom's action was a reasonable way to manage the photos or an overreach. Since the author altered the photos without the bridesmaid's consent, it could be seen as the groom being in the wrong (A). However, if the context is about personal control over wedding photos they paid for, it might be justified (B). But given that the question is from the groom's perspective and the phrasing \"AITA\" suggests he's the one asking if he's wrong, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance.\n"
