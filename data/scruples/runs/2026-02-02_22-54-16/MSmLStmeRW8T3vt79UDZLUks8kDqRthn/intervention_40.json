      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The situation involves over 600 photos, and the author mentions it was fun but also uses an emoji indicating frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which might have been a surprise. The author changed it in the photos, possibly because they found it unprofessional or didn't want it in the wedding pictures. \n\nEthically, altering someone's appearance without consent could be an issue. However, in this case, the bridesmaid might not have expected to be in the photos, or the author might have a right to edit images they took for their event. On the other hand, the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her personal expression, and editing it could be seen as erasing that. \n\nCultural norms also play a role. In some contexts, photos are considered the photographer's property, and they have the right to edit them. But if the photos are for public sharing, altering someone without consent could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author's intent is important. They said it was \"fun,\" which might indicate they enjoyed the challenge, but not malice. However, the act itself could be seen as disrespectful to the bridesmaid's choice. \n\nLegal aspects: If the photos are for personal use, the author might have more leeway. If the photos are to be shared publicly or used in a publication, there could be different considerations. \n\nPublic opinion in AITA threads often focuses on respect and consent. People might side with the author if they see the hair color as inappropriate for a wedding, or side with the bridesmaid if they believe personal choice should be respected. \n\nIn the end, the key factors are consent and the relationship dynamics. If the author didn't consult the bridesmaid and made a unilateral decision, that could be problematic. But if the author owns the photos and the editing is for their own satisfaction, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
