      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a husband, or maybe a groom, who took over 600 wedding photos. One of the bridesmaids showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random. He then edited all those photos to change her hair color to natural. He's asking if he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the person took the photos and is the one editing them, which is their creative choice. The bridesmaid's hair choice was unexpected, and maybe it didn't fit the wedding's aesthetic. But on the other hand, the bridesmaid's appearance is her choice. By editing her hair, the author is altering her natural look without her consent. That could be seen as a violation of her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that he did over 600 edits suggests it was time-consuming, but maybe he felt it was necessary for the photos. However, the bridesmaid might not appreciate having her appearance changed in the photos. It could be considered disrespectful to her personal expression. Especially in a wedding context, which is a significant event, people often have strong feelings about how they're portrayed.\n\nAnother angle: The author is the one who took the photos, so he might have the right to edit them as he sees fit for his own collection. But if the photos are shared publicly or with others, like in an album, then others might have a say. The key question is whether altering someone's appearance without their permission is acceptable.\n\nI think the main issue is consent. The bridesmaid didn't agree to have her hair color changed in the photos. Even if the author thought it was for the better, it's her choice how she presents herself. The act of editing her hair could be seen as erasing her self-expression. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't seek permission and altered someone else's appearance without consent.\n"
