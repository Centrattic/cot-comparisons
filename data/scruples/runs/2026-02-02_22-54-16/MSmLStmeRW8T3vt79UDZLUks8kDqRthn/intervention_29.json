      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is a wedding where one of the bridesmaids showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random. The author then edited over 600 photos to change the hair color. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author is altering someone else's image without their consent. That could be seen as a violation of their autonomy, especially if the bridesmaid didn't want their appearance changed. However, the context is a personal event\u2014the wedding. The author might argue that they wanted the photos to look more natural for the wedding album, which is a private matter.\n\nBut wait, the bridesmaid chose their hair color. Even if it was unexpected, the author has no right to change it without permission. Editing someone's look in photos without consent, especially for personal use, could be considered disrespectful. However, some might argue that in a wedding setting, there's an unspoken expectation of having nice-looking photos, so the author is trying to maintain that aesthetic.\n\nAlso, considering the number of photos\u2014over 600\u2014it's a significant effort. The author mentions it was \"fun,\" which might indicate they enjoyed the challenge. But the key point is consent. Without consent, altering someone's appearance in photos could be problematic, even for a friend or family member.\n\nAnother angle: the author's spouse and the bridesmaid's relationship. If the bridesmaid is a close friend, maybe there's an expectation of privacy or personal choice. However, the author is the one taking and editing the photos, so they have control over their own images. But the bridesmaid's image is part of that.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often take and edit photos for their own collections. However, changing someone else's physical appearance without their input crosses a line. It's different from, say, enhancing lighting or adjusting colors to improve the photo. Changing hair color from a choice they made might be seen as erasing their personal expression.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether altering someone's chosen appearance without consent is acceptable. I think the author might be in the wrong because they made a decision that affected another person's image without their consent, even if it was for a personal event. The bridesmaid might have wanted to be photographed with their chosen look, and the author's action could be seen as disrespectful to that choice.\n"
