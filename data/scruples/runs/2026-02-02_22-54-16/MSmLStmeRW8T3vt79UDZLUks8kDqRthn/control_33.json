      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural. The situation is their wife's wedding, and the bridesmaid showed up with unexpected blue hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's appearance without permission. Photoshopping someone's hair color changes their image, which could be seen as respecting the original request or being a personal choice. The author's reason is that the bride didn't expect the blue hair, which might clash with the wedding photos.\n\nBut wait, the author is changing the photos for their own collection. Is it their right to edit the images since they took them? Or does the subject have a say in how their image is used? There's a difference between editing for personal use versus public use. Since these are wedding photos for personal memories, maybe it's more about personal choice. However, the bride might feel her image was altered without consent, which could be a privacy issue.\n\nAlso, the tone of the original post seems to express frustration. The author spent over 600 photos, which is a lot of work, and they mention it was \"fun.\" Maybe they felt the blue hair was inappropriate for the wedding. But is that their decision to make? The bridesmaid might have had a right to express herself with the blue hair, even if it was unexpected.\n\nLegally, in many places, using someone's image in photos you took might not require their consent for personal use, but altering them could still be an issue. Ethically, it's about respect. The author might have thought they were preserving a more \"natural\" look, but the bridesmaid might prefer her true self in the photos.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author didn't get permission and altered the image without knowing the bridesmaid's preferences, then maybe yes. But if it's for personal photos and they didn't share it publicly, perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (wrong) because of lack of consent. But others might say B (not wrong) because it's their photos. Need to check the nuances here.\n"
