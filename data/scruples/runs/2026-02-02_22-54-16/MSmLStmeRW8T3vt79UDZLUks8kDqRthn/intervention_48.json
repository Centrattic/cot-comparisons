      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for editing a bridesmaid's hair color from blue to natural in wedding photos. The key points here are consent and context.\n\nFirst, the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found unexpected. They edited 600+ photos, which is a lot of work. But did they get permission? If not, that's a problem. People have the right to how their image is used, especially in public. Even if the blue hair was a surprise, altering someone's appearance without consent could be seen as violating their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the term \"randomly\" might be the author's way of expressing frustration, but that doesn't justify editing without asking. The author might have good intentions, like making the photos more cohesive, but the bridesmaid might prefer their natural look or be proud of their choice. Without consent, the author is imposing their preference on someone else.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action could be seen as trying to maintain the wedding's aesthetic. However, the right to edit someone's image in photos they didn't take themselves is debatable. The photographer might have taken the photos, but the subject's consent is still important. \n\nIn summary, while the motivation might be understandable, the lack of consent is a key issue here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
