      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color in over 600 wedding photos. The question is whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's appearance without consent. The bridesmaid chose to wear blue hair, which was unexpected. The author might have felt that it clashed with the wedding or was unprofessional. But the key point here is consent. Did the bridesmaid agree to have her hair color changed in the photos?\n\nPhotoshopping someone's image without their permission can be a violation of their autonomy. Even if the change is minor, like hair color, it's about respecting their choice. The author's reasoning was that it was \"random\" and they found it fun to change it. But the bridesmaid might have had a reason for her hair color, or she might not want her natural hair color to be used in photos. Also, the fact that there are over 600 photos makes the effort to edit them quite extensive, which might indicate that the author was more invested in the outcome than respecting the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is the one paying for the photos and has the right to edit them as they see fit. But in many cases, especially with people in the photos, there's an expectation that their likeness is represented as they appeared. Even if it's a personal event, editing someone's appearance without their consent could lead to issues if the person is uncomfortable with it.\n\nAnother angle is the context of a wedding. The author is responsible for the photos, but the bridesmaid's appearance is her own choice. The author might be projecting their own preferences onto the situation. The phrase \"randomly show up with\" suggests disapproval, but the bridesmaid might have had a valid reason for her hair color. The author's decision to change it could be seen as disrespectful to her personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that in a wedding, the primary focus is on the couple, and making the photos look cohesive is important. However, the bridesmaid's personal style should still be respected unless there's a specific dress code or agreement beforehand. Since there's no mention of that here, the author's action could be considered an overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, the key factors are consent and respect for personal choice. Without the bridesmaid's permission, altering her appearance in photos is likely a breach of trust and respect. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
