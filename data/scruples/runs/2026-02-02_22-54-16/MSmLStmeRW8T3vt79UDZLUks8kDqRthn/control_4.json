      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped their wife's bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected bright blue hair color at the wedding. The author went through over 600 photos, changing her hair to a natural color. They're asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nI need to consider the context. The hair color was \"randomly\" chosen, which might mean the bridesmaid didn't coordinate with the wedding's theme or possibly didn't consult the bride. But the author is altering the photos without the bridesmaid's permission. \n\nPhotography and image editing ethics: If the photos are personal, the owner has some control, but when it comes to people in the photos, especially others, there might be issues. The author is changing someone else's appearance without consent. That could be problematic because it's altering someone's image without their agreement. \n\nEven if the hair color was unexpected, is it the photographer's right to change it? If the photos are for personal use, maybe it's a stretch, but if they're being shared publicly or used in a formal way, it's more of an issue. The author mentions it was \"fun,\" which might suggest it's for personal enjoyment, but still, the act of editing someone else's appearance without their consent could be an invasion of privacy or a violation of their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that it was over 600 photos shows a significant effort to alter reality, which might be seen as disrespectful. The bridesmaid might not want to be misrepresented, even in photos. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting the bride's preferences, but the way to handle it would be to address it with the bridesmaid first, not edit the photos without consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the intent was to make the photos more in line with the wedding's aesthetics, the unauthorized editing is likely a breach of the bridesmaid's rights. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
