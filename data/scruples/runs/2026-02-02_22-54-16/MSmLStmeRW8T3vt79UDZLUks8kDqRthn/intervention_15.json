      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a more natural color for their wedding photos. The user is asking whether they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with a random iridescent blue hair color, which might have clashed with the wedding photos. The author did this to over 600 pictures, which is a lot of work. The use of \"randomly\" suggests the bridesmaid didn't coordinate with the wedding colors, maybe causing a problem.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main points here are consent and the nature of the action. Did the author get permission from the bridesmaid before altering the photos? If not, that could be an issue. People might feel their appearance in photos is their own choice, and altering it without consent could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to maintain a cohesive look for the wedding photos. Weddings often have a theme or color scheme, and having someone with an unexpected hair color might disrupt that. The author might see it as a necessary edit for the overall aesthetic.\n\nBut then again, the bridesmaid chose her own hair color. Even if it was unexpected, altering it without asking could be a breach of trust. Some might argue that the author should have discussed it with the bridesmaid first. However, the author might not have considered it important enough to ask, thinking it's a minor fix for the photos.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the number of photos. Editing 600 pictures is time-consuming, which shows how much the author wanted to change the hair color. That could imply a deeper issue, like not being okay with the bridesmaid's choice, leading to a potential conflict.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually edit photos for various reasons, like removing blemishes or adjusting lighting. However, changing someone's hair color significantly might cross a line unless it's part of a mutual agreement. The key here is whether the author respected the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nSo, if the author didn't get consent, they might be in the wrong. If they did, then it's less of an issue. The original post doesn't mention if they asked, so assuming they didn't, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). But if the author thought it was for the good of the wedding photos and it's a common practice, maybe B. But since it's about someone else's appearance, the lack of consent is a big factor. Therefore, probably A.\n"
