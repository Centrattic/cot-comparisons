      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The user is asking for an answer with A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a groom, and the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which was unexpected. He then edited over 600 photos to change her hair color. The key points here are consent, intention, and the nature of the action.\n\nThe user mentions that the bride's bridesmaid \"randomly\" showed up with blue hair. That might imply that the groom didn't expect it and found it inappropriate for a wedding. However, the bridesmaid's choice of hair color is her personal expression. The groom altered the photos without her permission, which could be seen as a violation of her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the groom might argue that the bright hair color was distracting or unflattering in the wedding photos. Weddings are significant events, and there might be expectations about appearance. But changing someone's hair color without consent could be considered disrespectful. It's important to note that the groom is altering the image to fit his preferences, which could be seen as controlling or dismissive of the bridesmaid's choice. \n\nAlso, the fact that he edited over 600 photos shows a significant effort to modify reality, which might be seen as going too far. Even if the hair color was unexpected, the groom's action might have been an overreaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main issue is consent. Without the bridesmaid's permission, changing her appearance in photos could be considered wrong. Even if the groom found the hair color unappealing, he shouldn't have the right to alter someone else's image without their agreement. The bridesmaid might have wanted her natural hair color represented or might have chosen the color intentionally. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he altered another person's image without their consent, which is a breach of respect for their autonomy.\n"
