      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. They mentioned over 600 pictures and called it \"fun,\" implying they found it tedious but did it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid chose to show up with an iridescent blue hair color, which the author found unexpected. They altered the photos to make it natural. The key points here are consent and intent.\n\nDid the author have the right to alter someone else's appearance in photos without their permission? The bridesmaid might have wanted to showcase her choice, and changing it without asking could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is the photographer, so maybe there's an expectation of some editing. But the alteration is significant, changing hair color entirely, not just minor touch-ups. \n\nAlso, the author's tone is dismissive (\"randomly show up\") which could indicate a lack of consideration for the bridesmaid's choice. Even if the author didn't like the hair color, editing it without consent might be a privacy issue. On the other hand, the author is the one who took the photos and might feel responsible for delivering a product that the couple wants. But the bride's side might have different preferences. \n\nConsidering the responses to similar situations in the past, altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent is often frowned upon, unless it's for a justified reason like removing a typo or a minor flaw. Changing hair color to a natural shade when the person intentionally chose a bold color could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
