      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for Photoshop'ing a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color. The author took over 600 photos and did this edit because the bridesmaid showed up with random blue hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is altering a photo of someone else without their consent. Even if it's their wedding, the bridesmaid might not be happy with being edited out of her authentic self. But maybe the context matters. Weddings are personal events, and sometimes people have strong feelings about the aesthetics. The author might have felt that the blue hair clashed with the wedding theme or the photos. \n\nOn the other hand, editing someone's appearance without permission could be seen as violating their personal expression. The bridesmaid chose her hair color, and the author's action might be seen as disrespecting her choice. However, the author is the one who took the photos, so they might have the right to edit their own images. But does that extend to changing someone else's appearance? \n\nAlso, the humor and the context of a wedding might make people more lenient. The author is making a joke about it being \"fun\" with the facepalm emoji, which suggests they're not malicious. Maybe the key point is consent. Since the bridesmaid didn't agree, but the author is the photographer, the line is blurry. \n\nIn many cases, people take and edit photos of others, but there's an expectation of consent, especially in public or events. The bridesmaid might not mind if they see the photos, but if the author is using them in a public way (posting online), that's different. The question is whether altering someone's image without consent is wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship and the use of the photos. Since it's a personal wedding, and the author is editing for their own collection, it might not be wrong. But if the photos are going to be shared publicly, it could be an issue. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I lean towards B as well because the context is personal and the alteration is minor (just hair color to match the wedding's aesthetic). The author isn't defacing or mocking the person, just adjusting for their own photos. So, B makes sense.\n"
