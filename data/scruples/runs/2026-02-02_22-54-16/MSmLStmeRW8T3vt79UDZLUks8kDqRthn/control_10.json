      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the statement is in the wrong. The situation is that the author photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color for their wedding photos, and over 600 pictures. The question is whether this makes them \"the asshole\" (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid chose to have iridescent blue hair, which the author found unexpected. The wedding is a significant event, and the author might have wanted the photos to look a certain way, perhaps more traditional or cohesive. However, editing someone's appearance without their consent could be an issue. \n\nOn one hand, the author is altering another person's image, which could be seen as disrespectful. The bridesmaid might have wanted to maintain her unique style, and the author making that decision for her could infringe on her autonomy. Especially in a formal setting like a wedding, people often expect to be portrayed as they are on that day, so changing it without asking might be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are collaborative events, and there might be expectations of maintaining a certain aesthetic. The author might have had to make a lot of photos look consistent, and maybe the blue hair was distracting or didn't match the theme. They could have had a good reason, like client satisfaction if they were a professional photographer, or personal preference for the wedding's appearance.\n\nBut since the author is the one who took the photos, they might have a duty to present them accurately unless there's a clear agreement otherwise. If the bridesmaid didn't object beforehand and the photos were of her choosing to have blue hair, editing it without consent could be a breach of trust. The comment about it being \"fun\" might come off as dismissive of the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nAlso, the use of over 600 photos suggests it wasn't a quick fix but a deliberate, extensive edit. That could amplify the issue. The key points are consent and respect for personal choices. Without consent, even if the intention was to make the wedding look better, it's a violation of the individual's right to how they are presented in professional settings.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because altering someone's appearance without their permission, especially in a significant number of photos, likely crosses a line. The author should have communicated with the bridesmaid before making such changes.\n"
