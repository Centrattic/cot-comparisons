      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be \"ashamed\" (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of altering someone's image without their consent. The bride's bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random for a wedding. The author then edited over 600 photos to change the hair color. \n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The bridesmaid didn't ask to have her hair altered, so editing her hair without permission could be seen as disrespectful. Weddings are significant events, and while personal style is important, the bride might have wanted to preserve the photos as they were. However, the author might argue that the blue hair was out of place and they wanted the photos to reflect their desired aesthetic.\n\nOn the other hand, others might say that the author has the right to edit their own wedding photos. But altering someone else's appearance could infringe on their personal autonomy. The fact that it was done to over 600 pictures makes it more significant, as it's a complete alteration of the record without the person's knowledge.\n\nI think the main issue is consent. Even if the author thought the blue hair was inappropriate, changing it without asking the bridesmaid is a breach of trust. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
