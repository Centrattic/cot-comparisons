      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where one of the bridesmaids showed up with unexpected blue hair, and the husband edited over 600 photos to change it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid chose to have iridescent blue hair, which was a personal choice. The husband found it random and decided to alter the photos to make it natural. Now, the question is about whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom a perspective of respect, altering someone's appearance without their consent could be seen as disrespectful. The bridesmaid might not have wanted her natural hair color to be changed. Even though the event is a wedding, which is a personal and important occasion, the act of changing her hair color in photos could be seen as overstepping. However, some might argue that the husband is just trying to make the wedding photos look better, as blue hair might not fit the traditional wedding aesthetic. But that reasoning could be used to justify altering any appearance, which might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her own. The husband's action could be seen as making a decision on her behalf, which invades her autonomy. Even if he did it for the sake of the photos, it's a form of editing that might not have been discussed with her. The fact that he did it to 600 pictures shows a significant effort, which might indicate he had a strong reason, but it's still his own judgment rather than respecting her choice.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. If he did it to make the photos more cohesive or because the blue hair clashed with the wedding theme, that's different from malice. But intent doesn't always negate the action's impact. The bridesmaid might feel her personal choice was disregarded, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might find it acceptable to edit photos for aesthetic reasons, especially in a wedding context. However, others might see it as crossing a boundary. It's possible that the husband didn't consider how the bridesmaid would feel if she saw the edited photos versus the original. There's also the aspect of ownership of the photos\u2014since it's the couple's wedding, they might have more control, but the individual in the photos also has rights to their image.\n\nI should also think about precedents. In similar situations, like editing someone's appearance in photos (e.g., slimming, changing features), it's often considered acceptable in some contexts but problematic in others. However, changing hair color, especially when it's a style choice the person made, could be more contentious. It's a personal expression, and altering that could be seen as erasing their choice.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the husband's action was unauthorized and changed an aspect of the bridesmaid's appearance. Even if done with good intentions, it's a breach of respect for her autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
