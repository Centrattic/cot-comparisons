      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who edited the bridesmaid's hair color in wedding photos is in the wrong. The situation is that the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, and the author changed it to a natural color in over 600 photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one who photoshopped the hair. The bridesmaid made a choice to have blue hair, which the author found random for a wedding. The question is whether the author overstepped by changing it without consent.\n\nFrom a privacy and respect standpoint, altering someone's appearance in photos without their permission could be an issue. Even though it's the author's photos, others might feel their image was altered without their approval. However, the author's justification is that the blue hair was unexpected and perhaps not suitable for the wedding photos.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a right to edit photos they took, especially for their own wedding. But the bridesmaid might not want their natural hair color changed. There's a balance between the author's creative control and respecting others' autonomy. \n\nI think the key points are consent and intent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid, so without consent, it's a breach of trust. However, the context is a personal event, and maybe the author felt it was necessary for the photos. But the act of editing over 600 photos shows it's a significant effort to change something the bridesmaid chose. So, the author might be in the wrong because they altered someone else's look without permission, even if it was their own photos.\n"
