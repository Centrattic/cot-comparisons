      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color. The situation is that the bridesmaid showed up with this unexpected hair color for the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are big events, and people often take a lot of photos. If a bridesmaid's hair color is unexpected and clashes with the wedding theme or the overall photos, the author might have wanted to adjust it for aesthetic reasons. However, editing someone's appearance without their consent could be an issue.\n\nBut the user argues that the author isn't in the wrong. The key points here are consent and intent. The author isn't altering the person's features in a harmful way but changing the hair color to something more traditional. However, the bridesmaid might feel that her choice of hair color was not respected, especially if it was intentional. Also, the fact that the author did this over 600 times could be seen as excessive, but it's for the photos, not the actual event.\n\nAnother angle is ownership of the photos. If the author took the photos, they might have the right to edit them as they see fit. But if others are in the photos, especially guests, there might be a social expectation to ask. However, in practice, people often edit photos without asking. The question is about being in the \"wrong\" in a social sense, not legally.\n\nThe humor in the original post (the emoji and the tone) suggests that the author is not being malicious. The term \"randomly\" might imply that the color was unexpected and perhaps uncoordinated. However, the bridesmaid might have chosen it intentionally. The author's action could be seen as respecting the wedding's aesthetic, but it's a personal decision. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people might not approve of editing others' photos without permission, it's a common practice. The main issue is whether it's a breach of trust or respect. Since the author is the one who took the photos and is using them for the wedding, their intent is likely to make the event look cohesive. The bridesmaid might be upset if they wanted their hair color to be part of the photos, but the author's action is more about their own collection than public distribution.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because it's a personal choice in photo editing, and while it might not be the most considerate action, it's not inherently wrong in a social context.\n"
