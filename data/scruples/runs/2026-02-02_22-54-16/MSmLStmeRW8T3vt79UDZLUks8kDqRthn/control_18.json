      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who photoshopped the bridesmaid's hair color is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person's wife had a bridesmaid who showed up with iridescent blue hair, which was unexpected. The person then edited over 600 photos to change her hair to a natural color. The question is whether this action is justified or if the person is wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The wedding is a major event, and the bride might have specific expectations about how everything looks. The bridesmaid's hair color was a surprise, which could clash with the wedding's aesthetic. The person might have done this to maintain the desired look for the photos, which are important keepsakes. However, altering someone's appearance without their consent could be problematic.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and intent. The bridesmaid might not have wanted her hair color changed, and the person edited the photos without asking. Even if the person had good intentions, changing someone's image without permission could be an invasion of privacy or artistic integrity. On the other hand, the person's frustration is understandable given the large number of photos and the unexpected hair color.\n\nI should also think about the impact. If the bridesmaid was okay with the blue hair, editing it out could be seen as disrespectful. But if the hair color was inappropriate for the wedding and the couple had requested certain colors, maybe there's some justification. However, the couple didn't mention any prior discussions about the hair color, so that's unclear.\n\nAnother angle is the use of the photos. If they are for personal use, the person might have more leeway. But if the photos are going to be shared publicly or used in a professional setting, the ethics might differ. Also, the fact that it was over 600 photos shows it was a significant effort, which might indicate the person was very committed to the change.\n\nBut ultimately, altering someone's appearance without their consent is generally considered unethical. Even if the reason is to fit an aesthetic, the bridesmaid has the right to how her image is presented. The person's action might be seen as overstepping, especially since the bridesmaid chose the color, and the person's justification is that it was random. However, the person could have discussed the issue with the wife or the bridesmaid instead of editing the photos themselves.\n\nIn summary, while the person might have had understandable reasons, the lack of consent is a major issue here. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
