      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The original post says the bridesmaid showed up with that hair color \"randomly\" for the wedding, and the author edited over 600 pictures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are significant events where people might have strong feelings about how they're presented. The author changed the bridesmaid's hair color without permission. Even if the color was unexpected, altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the iridescent blue was inappropriate or distracting for the wedding photos. The term \"randomly\" suggests that the bridesmaid didn't coordinate with the wedding party, which could be frustrating. However, editing photos to fit a desired aesthetic isn't a new concept, and many people do similar things with filters or retouching.\n\nBut the key point is consent. The bridesmaid probably didn't agree to have her hair color changed. Even though the author owns the photos, changing someone's features without their knowledge might be considered a violation of their image rights. Some might argue it's harmless fun, while others see it as overstepping boundaries.\n\nI also think about the intent. The author mentions \"it was fun,\" which implies it was done in a lighthearted way, not malicious. Still, the impact on the bridesmaid matters. If she found out, would she be upset? The author didn't ask for permission, so even if the intention was good, the action could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's action might come from a place of wanting to maintain the wedding's aesthetic, doing so without the bridesmaid's consent could be seen as inappropriate. So, the answer might lean towards \"Yes,\" the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure there aren't other factors. The user's own thought is that the author isn't wrong, so I should weigh both sides carefully. However, the lack of consent is a strong point against the author.\n"
