      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. They provided the AITA question where the author is asking if they're at fault for doing this with over 600 photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The bridesmaid chose to show up with an unusual hair color. The author modified the photos to make it natural. So, is that acceptable?\n\nWell, the author's intent was to make the wedding photos look more traditional or to align with expectations. The bridesmaid's choice was unexpected. The author might have a right to edit the photos for their own album, but does that affect the bridesmaid's autonomy?\n\nOn the other hand, altering someone's appearance without their consent could be seen as a violation of their personal choice. However, in the context of a wedding, where the primary subjects are the couple, maybe it's more about the couple's preferences. The author might be within their rights to edit the photos as they see fit since they paid for the photos or it's their event.\n\nBut then again, the bridesmaid might feel disrespected. But the author's action was to change an unexpected color to something more \"natural.\" There's no mention of the author changing other features or distorting the person's face. Just hair color. Also, the author mentions it was \"fun,\" which might indicate it's more of a light-hearted adjustment rather than a malicious act.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they are editing for their own album and the hair color was a personal choice of the bridesmaid that the author found inappropriate for the photos. The key here is consent. The author didn't ask, but maybe in such a context, the couple has the right to curate the photos as they see fit. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
