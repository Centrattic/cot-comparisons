      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who Photoshop'd a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is whether they did something wrong by editing the photos. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair \"randomly\" for a wedding. They took over 600 pictures and edited the hair color. The main issue here is whether altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent is wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, editing someone's image without their permission can be a gray area. If the person in the photo is unhappy with their appearance and the edit is made to make them look better, it might be kind. But in this case, the bridesmaid chose her own hair color. The author changed it to a natural color, possibly against her preferences. \n\nHowever, the wedding is the couple's event, and they might have a right to edit the photos to their liking, especially if the original hair color was unexpected and they found it unappealing. But there's also an argument that the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her personal expression, and altering it without asking could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nLooking at common perspectives: some might say it's the photographer's or the couple's right to edit photos as they wish for their event. Others might argue that the bridesmaid might not want her natural hair color to be the one that's presented publicly, especially if she intentionally chose the blue hair. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. If the author didn't ask the bridesmaid before editing, that could be a problem. But since the author is the one taking the photos and editing them for the wedding, maybe they're within their rights as the photographer or the main subject of the event. \n\nLegally, in many places, you can edit your own photos, especially if you're the photographer. Ethically, it's more subjective. Some people might find the edit harmless and even considerate if the blue hair wasn't to their taste. Others might think it's intrusive because it's changing someone's appearance without their say-so.\n\nThe use of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) forums often leads to varied opinions. In similar cases, sometimes people defend editing if it's to make the photos look better for the event, but others argue against altering someone's image without consent. The tone of the original question is a bit humorous (\"it was fun. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\"), which might indicate that the author sees it as a minor issue.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author's actions might be seen as a personal choice in editing their own wedding photos, but there's a valid concern about respecting the bridesmaid's personal choice in her appearance. The answer hinges on whose perspective is prioritized\u2014personal expression vs. the couple's preferences for their event.\n"
