      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is a wedding. The person took over 600 photos and edited one of the bridesmaids' hair from blue to natural. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with blue hair, which the author found random. The author might have done this to fit the wedding theme or make the photos look more traditional. But is altering someone's hair without permission acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the author is the one taking and editing the photos. They might feel responsible for the final look of the wedding photos. On the other hand, changing someone's appearance without their consent could be seen as a violation of their personal choice. The bridesmaid's hair color was a personal choice, so editing it without asking might be infringing on their autonomy.\n\nHowever, since it's a wedding and the photos are for the couple, maybe the author has some creative control. But the key point is consent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if they wanted their hair color changed. That's a problem because it's about respecting the other person's choices, even if they seem random or unexpected.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might be to maintain the wedding's aesthetic, altering someone's appearance without consent could be considered disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A. But I should also consider cultural norms around weddings and photography. In some contexts, editing photos for clients is expected, but when it comes to personal features, consent is usually important.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the photographer or someone responsible for the photos. If they edit the photos as part of their job, they might have some leeway, but the bridesmaid might not expect that. Still, the bride's side could argue that the photographer's role includes some editing.\n\nBut since it's a personal wedding, the line is blurry. The main issue is the lack of consent. The answer would be A because altering someone's hair color without their permission is a privacy and autonomy issue.\n"
