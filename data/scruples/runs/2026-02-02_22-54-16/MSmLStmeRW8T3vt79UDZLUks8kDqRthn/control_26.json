      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding photo with over 600 pictures, and the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which the author didn't like. They edited all the photos to change the hair color. Was that ethical?\n\nOn one hand, the author is editing their own wedding photos, which they paid for and are responsible for. They might have a right to edit the photos as they see fit, especially if the unexpected hair color was distracting. Wedding photos are personal and reflect the couple's vision, so making adjustments to ensure the photos look as intended could be seen as acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, altering someone's appearance without consent could be problematic. The bridesmaid might have chosen that hair color intentionally, and changing it without asking could be seen as disrespectful. However, since the author is the one who took the photos and owns them, they might have the right to edit them, even if it affects another person's appearance.\n\nAnother angle is the effort involved: over 600 photos. That's a lot of work, and the author might feel they had to do this to maintain the look of their wedding photos. But maybe the bridesmaid didn't realize the hair color was an issue, or maybe she didn't care. The key here is whether the edit was malicious or just a personal preference.\n\nIn online AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and context. If the author did this out of personal preference and not to mock or harm, it's less likely they're in the wrong. However, if it was done to spite or cover up something negative, that's different. Here, the tone seems more like frustration over a random choice, not malice.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: ownership of the photos, intent, and the nature of the edit. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is editing their own photos to meet their expectations, and the bridesmaid's choice was unexpected. Unless there was harm or malicious intent, it's a matter of personal preference and rights over the photos.\n"
