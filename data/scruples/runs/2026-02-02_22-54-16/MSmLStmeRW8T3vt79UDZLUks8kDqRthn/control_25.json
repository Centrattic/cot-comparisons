      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who photoshopped the bridesmaid's hair color is in the wrong. The question is asking for an answer A or B. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for editing a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color in over 600 wedding photos. The reason given is that the bridesmaid \"randomly\" showed up with that hair color for the wedding. The author seems frustrated, using an emoji (\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f) which suggests they're exasperated.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics here. Modifying photos is common, but does it cross a line when changing someone's hair color without permission? The key points here are consent and intent. The bridesmaid chose her hair color; maybe she wanted to stand out. The author might have done this to maintain a certain aesthetic for the wedding photos, perhaps to make the images look more \"traditional\" or to avoid bright colors. But is that their right?\n\nIn photography, especially for events like weddings, photographers usually have some leeway in editing, but there's also an expectation of truthfulness. However, the line between enhancing and altering is subjective. If the original hair color was a personal choice of the bridesmaid, changing it without her consent could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the author might argue that it's their prerogative since they're the one handling the photos for the couple's album.\n\nAnother angle: the number of photos (over 600) suggests it's a significant effort. The author might have done this to avoid the hassle of having a bright blue hair in all the pictures. But again, the bridesmaid might not have wanted that change. There's a lack of communication here. If the author had asked the bridesmaid or the bride to handle the situation, maybe there would be consent.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a wedding, which is a big day for everyone, the author might be the groom or a family member. Changing someone's appearance without their input could be seen as overstepping, especially if the bridesmaid's choice was her own. However, in some cultures or families, there might be different expectations about appearance at weddings.\n\nSo, the main issue is consent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid if it was okay to change her hair color in the photos. If the bridesmaid wanted to have blue hair, the author's action might be considered a violation of her autonomy. However, since the author is the one taking the photos and editing them, they might feel they have control over the final product.\n\nI need to weigh the respect for the subject's wishes versus the photographer's artistic freedom. In many cases, especially in professional photography, there's a discussion about any major edits. But in this case, it's a personal wedding, so maybe the lines are blurrier. But even then, the subject's hair color was a personal choice, and altering it without consent could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they changed someone's appearance without consent, which could be considered a breach of respect. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) if they believe the photographer has the right to edit photos as they see fit. But given the emphasis on the bridesmaid's choice and the lack of communication, the former seems more likely.\n"
