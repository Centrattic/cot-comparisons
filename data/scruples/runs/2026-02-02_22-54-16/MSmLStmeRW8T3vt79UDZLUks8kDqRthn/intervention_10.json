      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The original post is the author saying they did this because the bridesmaid showed up with blue hair for the wedding, and they ended up editing over 600 photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the spouse of the bride. The bridesmaid's choice of hair color is described as \"iridescent blue\" and \"randomly\" done. The author modified the photos to a natural color. The question is about whether this action is wrong.\n\nPossible angles to consider: consent and privacy. Did the bridesmaid agree to the photos being altered? The author is using the photos for their wedding, which is a personal event. However, altering someone's appearance without permission could be an issue. On the other hand, the author might feel that the blue hair is unflattering or inappropriate for the wedding photos. The wedding is a personal milestone, and the author might have a right to present it as they see fit. But others might argue that changing someone's appearance without consent is respectful, especially if the bridesmaid was aware that the photos would be shared. Also, the author is the one editing the photos, so maybe they have the right as the photographer or as the spouse. However, if the bridesmaid didn't want the blue hair altered, it could be a problem. Since the situation is presented as the author finding it annoying and choosing to edit them, the ethics depend on the relationship and expectations. The key factors are consent and the reason for the edit. If the bride and groom have the right to edit the photos as they wish, then maybe it's not wrong. Alternatively, if the bridesmaid would be upset by the alteration, even without being consulted, that could make the author at fault. But given the information provided, the author's reasoning is about personal preference and the photos being their own. The answer might hinge on whether altering someone's appearance without consent is considered wrong, even in a personal context. In many cases, people might see it as the author's prerogative to edit the photos they're using for their event. So the answer is B.\n"
