      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The question is framed as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario, which usually involves a moral or social dilemma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a groom who had over 600 wedding photos and found it \"fun\" to edit the bridesmaid's hair color. The bridesmaid chose to wear iridescent blue hair, which the author found random, and he changed it to a natural color. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and the purpose of the photos. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid's permission before editing her hair. In a wedding, the photographer usually has the right to edit photos, but they might have a responsibility to present the photos as they actually were unless there's a specific request to alter them. The bridesmaid might have wanted to be shown with her own choice of hair color, which could be important for her personal expression or to match the wedding's aesthetic. \n\nOn the other hand, the groom is the one who paid for the photos, so he might feel he has some control over how they are presented. However, the bridesmaid's choice of hair color could be seen as her personal style, and altering it without her consent could be disrespectful. The humor in the post (\"it was fun\") might downplay the seriousness of the situation. \n\nAlso, the fact that there were over 600 photos suggests that the edits were extensive, which could be seen as unnecessary or even malicious if done to mock the bridesmaid. Even if the groom didn't have malicious intent, changing someone's appearance without permission in a significant way could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, editing photos for a wedding is common, but changing someone's hair color without consent crosses a line. The bride or the person commissioning the photos usually has the authority to make such decisions, but the groom is editing a specific person's appearance without her input. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the groom might be in the wrong because he altered someone else's appearance without their permission, which could be seen as a breach of respect for their autonomy and personal choice. The humor in the post might not excuse the action in the eyes of others, especially the bridesmaid. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
