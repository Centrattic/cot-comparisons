      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a wedding photographer, probably. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected color, which might have clashed with the wedding theme. The author fixed it in the photos to make it natural. They mention it was over 600 pictures and it was fun. \n\nNow, the main points to consider: Was the bridesmaid's choice of hair color appropriate? The user says it was \"random,\" but maybe the bridesmaid just wanted to express herself. However, weddings are traditional events, so some might expect attire and appearance to match the theme. The author might have done this to maintain the wedding's aesthetic for the photos.\n\nBut then, is it the photographer's right to alter someone's appearance without permission? The bridesmaid might not have wanted their hair color changed. The photographer might have a responsibility to capture the event as it happened, not alter it. However, some might argue that adjustments for aesthetics are part of professional work. \n\nAlso, the bride's perspective is important. If the bride was okay with it, maybe it's not a problem. But the question is about the author's right. The key here is consent. Did the bridesmaid agree to the change? If not, then the photographer overstepped. But if the couple hired the photographer to make the photos look good, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nI think it's a gray area. On one hand, the photographer is making a judgment call for the photos' quality. On the other, altering someone's appearance without permission could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that the author found it \"fun\" might suggest they didn't see it as a big issue, but others might disagree. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the alteration was against the bridesmaid's wishes. Since the scenario doesn't mention consent, but the author did it without asking, it's possible they are in the wrong. But some might argue it's part of the job. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to maintain the wedding's aesthetic, but it's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the answer options are A or B, I need to pick one. Given that the author took initiative to make the photos better for the couple, and assuming the couple was okay with it, maybe B is the answer. But if the bridesmaid was upset, then A. Since the problem doesn't mention the bridesmaid's reaction, maybe the answer is B. Hmm.\n"
