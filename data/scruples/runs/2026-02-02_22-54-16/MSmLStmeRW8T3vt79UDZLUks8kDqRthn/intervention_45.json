      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. They got over 600 pictures and found it fun. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which the author found random. They edited the photos to change it. Now, is that acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing their wedding photos, which are personal. They might feel that the blue hair was inappropriate for the event's formality or didn't match the overall aesthetic. Editing photos is common in events to enhance or adjust elements for the final product. The fact that they took 600+ pictures suggests they put time into capturing the event, so ensuring consistency in the photos makes sense. Also, the use of \"fun\" indicates it was a lighthearted act, not malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the bridesmaid might have wanted to express herself with the blue hair, and altering it could be seen as disregarding her choice. However, the author is editing their own photos, not the bridesmaid's actual appearance. The photos are the author's property, so they have the right to edit them as they see fit. There's no harm done to the bridesmaid, just a change in the photos. Unless there was prior agreement to keep the hair as is, the author isn't violating any rules.\n\nAlso, considering the situation, weddings are significant events where people often have specific expectations. While the bridesmaid might have had a reason for her choice, the author isn't obligated to showcase every personal style in their photos. It's their right to present the event as they wish. Therefore, the action seems within their rights.\n"
