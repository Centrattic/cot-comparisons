      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The original question is \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) which suggests the poster is unsure if their action was wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is the author changed the bridesmaid's hair color in 600 wedding photos. The bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is editing photos they took, which they own. The bridesmaid's choice of hair color was her own decision. However, the author altered it without the bridesmaid's consent. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that the blue hair was distracting or didn't fit the wedding's aesthetic. They might feel it was a practical decision to make the photos look more cohesive. Plus, the photos are the author's, so they have the right to edit them as they see fit.\n\nOn the other hand, altering someone's appearance without their permission could be seen as a violation of autonomy. The bridesmaid might have wanted to keep her unique style in the photos. Even though the author owned the camera, the subject has some rights regarding their image. The author didn't ask, which could be a point against them. Also, doing this to 600 pictures is a lot and might be seen as overreaching or not respecting the bridesmaid's choice.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The key factors here are ownership of the photos, intent (to make the photos look better), and the lack of permission. If the author didn't share the altered photos publicly yet, maybe there's less issue. But if they did, it's more problematic. The humor in the original post might suggest it's more of a joke, but the actual ethics are still in question.\n\nIn similar situations, like editing someone's appearance in photos, it's often considered okay if it's a minor change for aesthetic reasons, but major alterations without consent can be an issue. The color change here is a significant alteration, but hair color is a personal style choice. The author might not be in the wrong if they owned the photos and the intent was to maintain a cohesive look. However, the lack of communication with the bridesmaid is a red flag. If the bridesmaid found out, she might be upset. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the context, maybe not. So the answer could be B.\n"
