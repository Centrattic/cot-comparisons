      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from blue to natural color is in the wrong. They presented the situation where the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair for the wedding, and the author edited over 600 photos to change the hair color.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's action was done without the bridesmaid's permission. Altering someone's appearance in photos can be seen as a violation of their autonomy and could embarrass or upset them. Even if the original hair color was unexpected, modifying it without consent might be considered disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have done this to maintain a certain aesthetic for the wedding photos, especially if the blue hair was out of place. They might argue that it was a personal choice to edit the photos for their own keepsakes. However, the key issue here is consent. If the bridesmaid had chosen to wear blue hair, even if the author found it random, they should have discussed any changes with her first.\n\nThe community's response (over 600 pictures edited) suggests that the author took it upon themselves to make a large number of edits, which could indicate that they were determined despite the effort. This might imply that they didn't consider the other person's feelings or preferences.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the lack of consent is a significant factor. While the author might not have intended any harm, the act of changing someone's appearance without their knowledge or approval can be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't seek permission before making such a personal edit.\n"
