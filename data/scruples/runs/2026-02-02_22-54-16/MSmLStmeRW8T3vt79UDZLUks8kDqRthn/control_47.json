      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who Photoshop'd a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person says the bridesmaid showed up with iridescent blue hair, which they found random for the wedding. They edited over 600 photos. The key points here are consent, the reason for editing, and the relationship dynamics.\n\nThe author is the husband of the bride, right? So maybe they're using their own photos. The question is about whether altering someone else's appearance in photos without permission is wrong. \n\nIn some cases, editing photos for personal use, like a family album, might be seen as acceptable, especially if it's for aesthetic reasons. However, if the edit is done without consent and could be seen as altering someone's identity or expression, there might be an issue. The iridescent blue could be a personal choice of the bridesmaid, and changing it without asking might be disrespectful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the photos are the husband's to manage, especially if they were taken for the wedding they paid for. There's a balance between respecting someone's appearance and controlling the photos you've taken. The author mentions it was \"fun,\" which might suggest it was a lighthearted act, not malicious. \n\nHowever, the bride might have a different perspective. Since it's her wedding, maybe she should have been consulted. The author's wife might not be happy if her husband altered a bridesmaid's hair without her input. Also, the term \"randomly show up\" implies disapproval, which could affect the relationship with the bridesmaid.\n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. If they used their own photos for personal use and didn't share the edited versions publicly without consent, maybe it's not wrong. However, if the edits were done without considering the bridesmaid's feelings or the wife's input, that could be an issue. \n\nI think it's a bit of a judgment call. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal relationships. But since the user is asking for a binary answer, I need to decide between A and B. Given that the author did it for their own enjoyment and the photos are theirs, but the act could be seen as disregarding the bridesmaid's choice, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue it's B because it's their own photos. Hmm.\n"
