      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the author did this over 600 photos because the bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected blue hair color.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The person modified someone else's appearance in photos without their consent. Even though the original color was unexpected, altering someone's image without permission could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. The bridesmaid might have wanted to express themselves with that hair color, and changing it could be considered disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the context is a wedding event, which is personal and perhaps the author feels the blue hair was not suitable for the photos. The author's justification is that they found it \"fun,\" but that's subjective. Others might argue that it's not their place to alter someone else's appearance, especially without asking. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for personal expression. Without consent, even if the motive is to make the photos look better, the act of editing someone's image without permission could be ethically questionable. On the other hand, some might argue that since the photos are the author's property, they have the right to edit them as they wish. But that's a bit of a gray area, especially when it involves others' images. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common to edit photos for aesthetic reasons, but changing someone's hair color without their knowledge crosses into personal territory. It might also affect the bridesmaid's feelings if they see their natural color altered. The randomness of the blue hair is mentioned, but the author's solution was to change it, which might not be the bridesmaid's preference. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the act of editing without consent is likely the wrong move, even if the intention was to correct an unexpected choice. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong because they didn't respect the bridesmaid's autonomy in that choice.\n"
