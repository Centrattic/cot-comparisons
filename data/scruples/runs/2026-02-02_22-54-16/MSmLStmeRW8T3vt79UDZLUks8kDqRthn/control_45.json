      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color in over 600 wedding pictures because the bridesmaid showed up with that color randomly. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author is the one who did the editing. The bridesmaid had iridescent blue hair, which the author didn't like. The author changed it to a natural color in all those photos. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is altering someone else's image without their consent. Even though it's their wedding photos, the bridesmaid might not have wanted her hair color changed. The author might have a right to edit the photos they took, but changing someone's appearance could be an issue. On the other hand, the bridesmaid chose the hair color herself, so maybe the author has a point in wanting it to be natural in the photos.\n\nBut then again, the author is making a judgment about what the bridesmaid should look like. The bride might not be happy if the photos don't reflect the actual event. Also, editing 600 photos is a lot of work. The author's reasoning is that it was \"fun,\" which might not justify the action. The bridesmaid might feel disrespected if the author didn't ask first. \n\nI should also think about similar situations. Like, if someone photoshops their friend's face out of a photo because they didn't want them there, people often say it's wrong because it's erasing someone from a memory. In this case, it's not erasing but altering. But it's still a significant change. \n\nThe author might argue that the blue hair was distracting or didn't fit the wedding's theme. However, the bridesmaid chose that color, so maybe the author should have respected her choice. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, especially if the bride is okay with the photos as they were. \n\nAnother angle: if the author shared these photos publicly, changing someone's image without consent could lead to issues. If the photos are for personal use, maybe the author has more leeway, but it's still about consent. \n\nI think the key here is consent. The author didn't ask the bridesmaid or the bride if it was okay to change her hair color. Even if the author owns the photos, altering someone's appearance in a way that they might not want could be wrong. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they altered someone else's image without permission.\n"
