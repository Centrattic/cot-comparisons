      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural is in the wrong. They mentioned over 600 pictures and that it was \"fun.\" The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which might have been a surprise. The author changed it in the photos. But what's the issue here?\n\nOwnership of the photos matters. If the author took the pictures, they might have more leeway. But if someone else took them, the author might not have the right to edit them. Also, was the bridesmaid aware of the editing? If the photos are going to be shared, especially if the bridesmaid might be in them publicly, changing her hair without consent could be an issue.\n\nIntent is another factor. The author says it was fun, but altering someone's appearance without permission can be considered disrespectful. Even if the original choice was unexpected, editing it out without asking might infringe on the bridesmaid's autonomy. On the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to edit their own photos, especially for their wedding.\n\nHowever, weddings are significant events where everyone's image is captured. Changing someone's hair color could be seen as a violation of their personal choice. The key points are consent and respect. If the author didn't ask the bridesmaid, it could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the bride was okay with it, the bridesmaid's feelings matter too.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author had permission. Since the original post doesn't mention asking the bridesmaid, it's possible the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit split because the user's perspective is that it's not wrong. Still, altering someone's image without consent, even if well-intentioned, could be problematic.\n"
