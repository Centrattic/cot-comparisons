      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who photoshopped their wife's bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is a wedding photographer or someone who took over 600 photos for their wife's wedding. One of the bridesmaids showed up with iridescent blue hair, which the author found random. So they went through all those photos to change the hair color to something natural. The person is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for doing this. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. The author altered photos without the bridesmaid's consent. That's a key point. Even if the author didn't like the hair color, changing someone's appearance in photos without permission could be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, the bridesmaid made a choice to have that hair color, which the author found inappropriate for a wedding. But is it the author's place to edit that out?\n\nWedding photos are supposed to capture the event as it happened. Altering someone's hair color would be changing the reality of the event. The author might justify it by saying it was to maintain a more professional or traditional look, but that's subjective. The bridesmaid might feel her personal choice was erased, which could lead to hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author went through 600+ photos to do this shows a significant effort, which might be excessive. It could be seen as obsessive or controlling. However, the author might not have been the one who took the photos; maybe they are the photographer or the person handling the photos for the family. \n\nThe key issue is consent. If the bridesmaid didn't ask for the change, the author's actions could be considered unethical. It's possible that the author thought they were doing a favor for the bride or groom, but without everyone's input, it's a risky move. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in professional photography, some editing is expected, like touch-ups for hair or skin. But changing a hair color from blue to natural is beyond typical edits and could be seen as altering someone's identity in the photos. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was a breach of the bridesmaid's autonomy. Even if done with good intentions, the lack of consent is a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
