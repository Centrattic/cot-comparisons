      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color in over 600 wedding photos. The author is asking if they're the asshole here (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which the author found surprising. The author then spent time editing the photos to change the hair color. The main question is whether altering someone's appearance in photos without their consent is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the blue hair was distracting or didn't fit the wedding's aesthetic. They might have wanted the photos to look more natural or professional. However, editing someone's hair color without their permission could be seen as altering their image, which might be a privacy or respect issue. The bridesmaid might have wanted to express herself through her hair color, and the author's action could be seen as disregarding that choice.\n\nBut then again, the author is the one who took the photos. They have the right to edit their own photos, right? However, changing someone's appearance significantly without their consent can be problematic. It's a form of altering someone's image, which could be considered disrespectful. Especially in a wedding context, where the photos are important for both the couple and the attendees.\n\nI should also think about the relationship. The author is married to the bride, so maybe the bridesmaid is a close friend or family member. Even if the hair color was unexpected, the author's action might not consider the feelings of the person involved. It's possible that the bridesmaid was proud of her choice and was upset by the edits.\n\nAnother angle: the author spent a lot of time doing this, so maybe they were trying to make the photos look better for the couple. But is that a valid reason to change someone's appearance? It's a balance between personal preference and respecting others' choices.\n\nIn terms of ethics, altering someone's image without consent is generally frowned upon. It's similar to changing someone's face or body in photos without their approval. The argument here is about consent and respect for personal choices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they modified someone else's appearance without their permission, potentially violating their autonomy and the way they wanted to present themselves. However, some might argue that since the author took the photos, they have the right to edit them. But the key issue is the significant alteration of a personal feature without consent.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
