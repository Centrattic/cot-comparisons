      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The bride's bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected blue hair color. The author, the groom, edited over 600 photos to change it. The question is about right or wrong here.\n\nOn one hand, the groom is altering photos that belong to him and his wife. The bridesmaid might have had a reason for her hair color, but it was unexpected. The groom might feel that the blue hair doesn't fit the wedding's aesthetic. He's using his own photos, so technically, he has the right to edit them as he sees fit.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the bridesmaid didn't consent to the edits. Changing someone's appearance without permission could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. But since it's photos the groom took, he might have more control over them. Also, the groom's wife might not mind, as it's their wedding photos they want to preserve a certain way.\n\nI should also think about common practices. Often, people edit photos to correct lighting, adjust colors, or remove blemishes. Changing hair color could be similar to skin tone adjustments, which are common. However, changing a distinctive feature like iridescent blue to natural might be more noticeable and intentional.\n\nBut the key points are consent and ownership. The groom owns the photos, so he can edit them. The bridesmaid might not like it, but unless there's a prior agreement about not altering photos, the groom isn't necessarily wrong. Also, the groom's wife might be the one who wants the photos to look a certain way, so he's acting in line with her wishes.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The groom has the right to edit the photos he took for his wedding, and the bridesmaid's choice of hair color was unexpected. The groom's action, while possibly seen as over-the-top, isn't unethical if he's the one preserving the photos as he and his wife desire.\n"
