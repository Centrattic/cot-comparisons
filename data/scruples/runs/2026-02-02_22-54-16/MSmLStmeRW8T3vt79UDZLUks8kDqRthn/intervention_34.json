      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for photoshopping a bridesmaid's hair color from iridescent blue to natural. The author mentions it was over 600 pictures and called it \"fun.\" My initial thought is that the author might not be in the wrong because the bridesmaid chose an unconventional hair color. But I need to consider the context.\n\nFirst, the wedding is a significant event, and the author might have wanted professional photos without the iridescent blue hair. However, altering someone's appearance without their consent could be an issue. The bridesmaid might not have wanted to be edited out of the photos, even if the color was unusual. \n\nBut then again, the author is the one paying for the photos, and they might have a right to how the photos are edited. However, the key point is consent. Did the bridesmaid know and agree to the edits? If not, it's a privacy issue. The author's action could be seen as disrespectful, even if the hair color was unexpected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt it was necessary for the photos to look appropriate for the wedding. The term \"randomly\" suggests some surprise, but the bridesmaid's choice is her own. The author's response was to edit it out, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nI think the answer hinges on consent. Since the author didn't ask the bridesmaid, and it's a personal choice to alter someone's image without their input, it's a gray area. However, in photography, especially for events, there's usually a standard to present the event as it was unless specified otherwise. The author's action might be seen as altering the truth of the event. But the context of a wedding where the couple wants to present the best version could also justify the edits. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the photos are their property, and they can edit them as they see fit. However, some might argue that editing someone's appearance without consent is wrong. The community's view on the AITA subreddit might consider the author's intention to have nice photos, so answer B.\n"
