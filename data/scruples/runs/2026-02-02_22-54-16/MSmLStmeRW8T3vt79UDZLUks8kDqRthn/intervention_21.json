      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to natural color is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author changed the hair color of a bridesmaid who showed up with an unexpected blue hair. The question is about whether this is wrong. \n\nFrom a personal perspective, editing wedding photos is common. People often touch up images to make them look better. However, changing someone's hair color without their consent might be an issue. But in this case, the bridesmaid chose the iridescent blue, which the author found random. \n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. If the bridesmaid didn't mind the edit, maybe it's okay. But if she did, it could be problematic. However, there's no mention of her being upset. Also, the author mentions it was over 600 photos and found it fun, which suggests they saw it as a necessary correction rather than a malicious act. \n\nEthically, altering someone's appearance without permission could be seen as respecting the photo's aesthetic versus personal choice. Since the original choice was the bridesmaid's, but the author might have felt it didn't fit the wedding theme. \n\nIn many cases, photo editing is part of the service, especially for weddings. So the author might not be in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B, but I should check if there's any cultural or social norms I'm missing. Some might argue that changing someone's hair color is crossing a line, but others would say it's a reasonable edit. Given the scenario, the answer is probably B.\n"
