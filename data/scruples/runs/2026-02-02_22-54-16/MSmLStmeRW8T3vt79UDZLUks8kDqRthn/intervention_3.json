      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who photoshopped a bridesmaid's hair from iridescent blue to a natural color is in the wrong. The original question is \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), so they want to know if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author changed the hair color in over 600 wedding photos without permission. The bridesmaid showed up with an unexpected hair color, which might have been a personal choice. But the author altered it without asking. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the blue hair was inappropriate for the wedding photos and wanted to present a more natural look for the event. However, editing someone's appearance without their consent could be seen as a violation of their autonomy. People have the right to how their image is presented, especially in professional photos.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned it was \"fun,\" which might not take into account the feelings of the bridesmaid. The bridesmaid might have wanted to keep the blue hair as a personal statement or for a reason. The author's action could be seen as disrespectful, even if well-intentioned. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. They might argue that it's their own wedding photos and they have the right to edit them as they see fit. However, there's a difference between editing your own photos and altering someone else's image without consent. \n\nLegally, the author owns the copyright to the photos, so they can edit them. But ethically, it's a gray area. It's about consent and respect for the person's choices. If the bridesmaid found out, she might be upset. The author didn't consider her wishes, which is a key point in determining if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, balancing the ownership of the photos against the ethical consideration of consent, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't ask for permission. Even if it was a wedding they paid for, the bridesmaid's image was altered without her say-so. That's probably why the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
