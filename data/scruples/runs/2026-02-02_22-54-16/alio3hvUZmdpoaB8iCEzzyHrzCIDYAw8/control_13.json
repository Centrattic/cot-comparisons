My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. The boyfriend is sweet and makes an effort to lose weight, but the author avoids introducing him to friends due to this shame.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits, like being considerate and trying to improve his health. However, the shame aspect is causing issues. The boyfriend is making efforts, but progress is slow because of his schedule and habits. The author uses his weight as an argument point, which makes him apologize instantly.\n\nShaming someone for their body, even if it's not directly said, can be harmful. The author's behavior of avoiding friends and using the boyfriend's weight in arguments might contribute to his emotional distress. The boyfriend's reactions (apologizing) suggest he feels hurt or guilty, which isn't healthy. The author's feelings are valid, but acting on them in a way that affects the boyfriend negatively might be the problem here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is in good shape might introduce a comparison, but the issue isn't about their own fitness. The main point is the shame and how it's affecting the relationship. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits show he values the relationship, but the author's shame could undermine his self-esteem. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's well-being is important. However, the author's actions seem to prioritize their own social comfort over the boyfriend's emotional well-being. They need to address their own feelings without making the boyfriend feel like his worth is tied to his weight. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because shame and judgment, even if unspoken, can be damaging. The author should work on their own insecurities and find healthier ways to support their partner rather than letting shame influence their actions.\n"
