My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him, even though they're happy with him otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a relationship where their boyfriend is overweight. They admit to feeling ashamed and hiding him from friends. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but is struggling. The author also mentions bringing up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him emotionally.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want an opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, shame and body image issues can be problematic. The author is making their partner feel bad about themselves, even if unintentionally. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the pressure from the author might be harmful. \n\nAlso, in a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's well-being without making the other feel ashamed. The author's actions\u2014hiding the boyfriend from friends and using weight as an argument point\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author is fine with the boyfriend's appearance personally, the shaming in public and private is an issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's emotional response (apologizing instantly) suggests he feels guilty, which isn't right. The author's shame is affecting his self-esteem. This dynamic isn't healthy. So, even if the author's intentions aren't malicious, the impact is negative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for contributing to their partner's insecurity and shame.\n"
