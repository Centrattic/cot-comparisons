My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and not wanting friends to meet him because of that. They mention that they like their boyfriend and he's making efforts to lose weight, but their comments during arguments hurt him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's feelings are justified. It's common for people to feel self-conscious about their partner's appearance, but the key here is the impact on the boyfriend. The boyfriend is okay with himself, but the author's comments make him feel bad, leading to apologies. That's a problem because the boyfriend shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of himself if he's comfortable with his body.\n\nThe author is in a position where their shame is affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem. Even if the author is making efforts to support his weight loss, the underlying issue is the author's own feelings of shame. That's not healthy for the relationship. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's behavior is contributing to his distress during arguments.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author avoids their friends meeting the boyfriend because of shame is a red flag. It suggests that the author is prioritizing their own social comfort over their partner's feelings and the relationship's health. While it's okay to have personal preferences, causing someone to feel ashamed for who they are is wrong. The boyfriend's efforts to improve are commendable, but the author should support him without making him feel that his worth is tied to his weight loss progress.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's shame and the resulting negative impact on the boyfriend's self-esteem make them at fault. The answer should be A.\n"
