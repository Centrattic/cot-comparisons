My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they're ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight, even though they love him and he's a good person. They avoid introducing him to friends because of this shame, and sometimes bring up his weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is comfortable with their boyfriend's appearance but feels ashamed when friends see him. They've discussed this with him multiple times, and he's trying to lose weight, but progress is slow due to his schedule and habits. When they argue, the author uses his weight as a point, which affects him and leads to apologies.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is body shaming. Even if the author claims they're okay with his looks, the fact that they feel ashamed and bring it up in arguments could be problematic. It's important to note that the boyfriend's efforts to change might be driven by the author's comments, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy or insecurity. The boyfriend is affected and apologizes, indicating that the author's words hurt him. \n\nMoreover, the author is in a good shape themselves, which might create an implicit standard. While they love him and he's a good partner, the shame aspect is about others' judgments, which is a societal issue. However, projecting that shame onto the boyfriend and making it a point of contention in their relationship is not healthy. It's about the author's own feelings and insecurities about social judgment rather than the boyfriend's actual worth. \n\nIn relationships, it's essential to support each other without making the other feel like they need to change for social acceptance. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight might be a positive step, but if it's due to the author's shame, that's a different issue. The author's behavior, even if well-intentioned, is making the boyfriend feel that his weight is a problem in the relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author loves him and the boyfriend is okay with his looks, the act of feeling ashamed and using it as an argument point is harmful. It's about the author's own insecurities and societal pressures, which are their responsibility to address, not the boyfriend's. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
