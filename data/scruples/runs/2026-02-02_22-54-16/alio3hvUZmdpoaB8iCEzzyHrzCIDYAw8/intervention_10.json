My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author is ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They admit he's sweet and always considerate, but they avoid showing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are about shame and how the author treats their partner. Being ashamed of someone for their body size is a common issue, but it's problematic because it can lead to harmful behavior. The author is making their boyfriend feel bad by using his weight as an argument point, even if they claim to be okay with it. The boyfriend is affected emotionally and apologizes, which suggests that the comments are hurtful.\n\nEven though the author says they're fine with his appearance, the fact that they avoid friends meeting him due to shame indicates an internal conflict. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's trying to meet their expectations, but the author's criticism is affecting his self-esteem. \n\nSocietal standards often stigmatize weight, but that doesn't justify the behavior. The author's actions contribute to the boyfriend's stress and may hinder his ability to improve his health, especially if he's already struggling with his schedule. The main issue here is the author's negative reaction and the way they use the boyfriend's weight in arguments, which is not healthy for the relationship.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions aren't malicious, the impact of their actions is harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
