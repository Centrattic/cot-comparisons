My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend for being fat. They've been together over a year, and the boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate. The author mentions they're in good shape, but don't want their friends to meet the boyfriend because of his weight. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight, though progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize instantly.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author feeling ashamed of someone else's body. That's a clear red flag. Feeling ashamed of someone else, even if it's a partner, is a form of body shaming. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, but the author is using his weight as a point of contention during arguments. That's not healthy for the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is to apologize, which suggests he's internalizing the shame the author is projecting.\n\nThe author claims they're okay with his looks but don't want friends to see him. That contradiction is key. If they're okay with his looks, why the embarrassment? It's possible the author has internalized fatphobia or societal standards that make them uncomfortable. The fact that the author brings up weight during arguments is toxic because it's using the partner's body as a weapon in conflicts. That's not just about body image but about emotional manipulation and control.\n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise show he's trying to meet the author's standards, which indicates he's influenced by their shaming. The author might not realize they're contributing to the problem. The relationship isn't healthy if one partner is constantly shaming the other's body, even if it's under the guise of concern. The author's shame is affecting the partner's self-esteem and creating a dynamic where the boyfriend feels he needs to apologize for his body.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is definitely in the wrong. They need to address their own feelings of shame and stop projecting that onto their partner. The answer should be A.\n"
