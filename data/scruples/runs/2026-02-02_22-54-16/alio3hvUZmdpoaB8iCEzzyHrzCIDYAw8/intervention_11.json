My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a woman who's ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to her friends. She mentions that he's making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. They've been together over a year, and she loves him, but the shame persists.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is feeling ashamed of her partner's appearance. While she says she's fine with how he looks, the fact that she doesn't want friends to meet him suggests a conflict between her feelings and her actions. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him emotionally. He's trying to improve, but she's using it as a point of contention.\n\nShame and body image are sensitive topics. Even if she's not outwardly cruel, internalized shame can still harm the relationship. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits show he cares about her feelings, but it's not his responsibility to change for her. The author's actions might contribute to his self-esteem issues, especially since he apologizes after arguments related to his weight. That's a red flag because it's not his fault for the shame she feels. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should support each other's well-being, but pressuring someone to change their body for the other's comfort isn't healthy. The author's avoidance of friends meeting her boyfriend could stem from her own insecurities or societal pressures, and that's not fair to him. It's his right to be accepted as he is. While she loves him and he's kind, her behavior might be exploiting his efforts to make him conform to her standards. \n\nSo, even though she has positive feelings, her actions are still problematic. The answer would likely be A, that she's in the wrong because she's letting her own shame affect the relationship negatively.\n"
