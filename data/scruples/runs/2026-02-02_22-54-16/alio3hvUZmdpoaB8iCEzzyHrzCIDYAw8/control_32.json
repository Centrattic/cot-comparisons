My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and not wanting friends to meet him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author likes their boyfriend a lot, mentions he's sweet and always prioritizes their well-being. The boyfriend is overweight, and the author is okay with his looks but feels ashamed when friends see him. The boyfriend is okay with himself and trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend negatively.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame towards their partner's body. Even though the author says they're fine with his appearance, the fact that they feel ashamed and hide him from friends is problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which might be due to the author's comments. Also, using the weight as an argument point is likely hurtful, even if the author doesn't realize it. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should support each other. Feeling ashamed of someone's body can lead to insecurity and low self-esteem in the partner. The boyfriend is already affected by the comments, which shows that the author's actions are having a negative impact. Even if the author's intention isn't to hurt, the outcome is harmful. \n\nSo, the key factors here are the shame and the use of weight as a point of conflict. Body image issues in relationships can be a sign of deeper problems, like insecurity or lack of self-acceptance. The author's behavior might be contributing to the boyfriend's efforts to lose weight, but in a way that's not supportive. It's important to consider that pressuring someone to change their body for the sake of others' opinions isn't healthy. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they're allowing their shame to affect their partner's self-esteem and the dynamic of their relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
