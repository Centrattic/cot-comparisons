      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe person is in a relationship with their boyfriend. They've been together over a year, and the boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate. The author mentions that their boyfriend is overweight but that they are okay with his appearance. However, the issue arises because the author doesn't want their friends to meet him, fearing judgment. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow due to his schedule and habits. The author also says that during arguments, they bring up his weight, which upsets him, and he apologizes each time. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally are okay with it. They don't want friends to meet him, which is a form of social exclusion based on his appearance. They also use his weight as an argument point, which affects his emotional state. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health but is struggling.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and what's considered acceptable behavior in relationships. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight is a personal feeling, but acting on it by excluding them from social interactions and using it as a weapon in arguments is problematic. The boyfriend's weight is a personal matter, and the author's actions are affecting his self-esteem and efforts to improve his health.\n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other. If the author is truly okay with his weight, why bring it up in arguments? That suggests that the shame is influencing her actions negatively. Also, the boyfriend's efforts to lose weight show he's trying to meet her expectations, which might be due to her comments making him feel insecure.\n\nThe fact that he apologizes after she brings it up in arguments indicates that he's hurt by her words. Even if the author's intention isn't malicious, the impact is harmful. It's important to consider how one's actions affect their partner's mental health. Feeling ashamed of someone for their body can lead to issues like low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, or even eating disorders.\n\nAdditionally, not wanting friends to meet the boyfriend because of his weight is a sign of not being proud of him, which can damage trust and respect in the relationship. People have the right to be accepted for who they are in a relationship, including their body size. The author's behavior might be fostering an environment where the boyfriend feels he needs to change himself to be accepted.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't forcing him to change and he's making his own efforts. But the problem lies in the author's role in making him feel that his current state is a problem. Even if she's not directly pressuring him, her shame and bringing it up in arguments contribute to his stress and self-doubt.\n\nIn terms of accountability, it's about holding someone responsible for their actions. The author is using her own feelings of shame as a reason, but that doesn't excuse the negative impact on her partner. The right approach would be to address the underlying reasons for her shame, perhaps through self-reflection or therapy, rather than projecting it onto her partner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is creating a situation where her partner's self-worth is being tied to his weight, and she's contributing to his emotional distress. Even if her intentions are good, the outcome is harmful. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
