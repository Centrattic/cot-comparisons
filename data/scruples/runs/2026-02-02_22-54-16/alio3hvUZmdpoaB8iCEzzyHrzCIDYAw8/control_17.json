My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author is in a relationship where they feel ashamed of their boyfriend's weight but acknowledge he's a sweet, considerate person. They avoid introducing him to friends due to this, which makes the boyfriend feel affected. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, leading to the boyfriend apologizing.\n\nNow, considering relationships and self-esteem. Making someone feel ashamed about their body, even if unintentionally, can harm their self-esteem and the trust in the relationship. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health should be supportive, not criticized. The fact that the author brings it up during arguments shows it's a sensitive and potentially harmful topic. Even if the author isn't directly bullying, the shame and conditional acceptance (being okay with him but not wanting others to see him) can be damaging. \n\nSocietal standards and body image play a role here. Weight can be a sensitive issue, and partners should support each other's health goals without judgment. The boyfriend's emotional response (apologizing) indicates that the comments hurt him. Also, the author's desire to avoid judgment from friends might reflect their own insecurities or societal pressures, but that doesn't justify making the boyfriend feel ashamed.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. The author is prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's feelings, which can be seen as selfish. Even if the boyfriend is making efforts, the focus should be on health and well-being, not just appearance for others. The fact that the author is in good shape might contribute to the perception that the boyfriend's weight is an issue, but that's a personal bias.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're contributing to their boyfriend's insecurity and using his appearance as a leverage in arguments, which is harmful. The answer should be A.\n"
