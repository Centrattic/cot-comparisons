My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him, even though they acknowledge he's a kind person.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author admits they're fine with his looks but feel ashamed when friends meet him. They mention that their boyfriend is making an effort to lose weight but it's slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, leading him to apologize. The key points here are about body image, self-esteem, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship health. Body shaming is generally frowned upon. Even if the author isn't directly shaming the boyfriend, their avoidance and using weight as a point in arguments can be harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to change and his emotional reaction (apologizing) suggest that the comments are affecting his self-esteem. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to see him. This might stem from their own insecurities or fear of judgment. However, making someone feel like they need to change for the relationship is a common issue in unhealthy relationships. The fact that the author uses the weight as an argument point shows it's not just about friends but also about control or insecurity in the relationship. \n\nEven though the boyfriend is making efforts, the core issue is the author's behavior towards him. The boyfriend's feelings and the emotional impact are significant. In healthy relationships, partners should support each other without making the other feel ashamed. The author's actions, despite loving him, are contributing to his emotional distress. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're body-shaming their partner, which is affecting his self-esteem and the relationship dynamics negatively. Even if the intention isn't malicious, the effect is harmful. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
