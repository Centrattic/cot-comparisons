My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight, even though they personally don't have an issue with his looks. They avoid letting friends meet him to prevent judgment. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow due to his schedule and habits. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, and he apologizes, which affects him negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is feeling ashamed, which is a personal feeling. However, acting on that shame by avoiding friends meeting the boyfriend could be problematic. It's important to treat a partner with respect and not let personal insecurities affect their self-esteem. The boyfriend is already making efforts to address the issue, which shows he cares about the relationship. The fact that the author brings up his weight during arguments might be contributing to his emotional distress. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing him, using his weight as a point of contention during conflicts can be hurtful. The boyfriend's apologies suggest he feels the need to defend himself, which isn't healthy for either person. The author's actions might be leading to a situation where the boyfriend feels he has to change for the relationship, which could be a form of emotional pressure. While the author isn't saying they hate him, the underlying message of avoiding public appearances might imply that they are embarrassed. In relationships, it's important to support each other without making the other person feel like they need to change to be accepted. So, even if the author's intentions are to avoid social judgment, the consequence of making the boyfriend feel ashamed or inadequate might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their actions are affecting the boyfriend's self-worth and the relationship dynamics negatively.\n"
