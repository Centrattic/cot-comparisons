My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and keeping it a secret from friends, even though she's okay with his appearance herself. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits she's ashamed and avoids friends meeting her boyfriend because she doesn't want to be judged. She mentions that her boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress due to his schedule. She also says that during arguments, she brings up his weight, which upsets him.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, feeling ashamed of someone for their body image is usually considered a negative trait. It's important to value a partner for their personality and character, not just their appearance. The boyfriend is described as sweet and caring, so the shame seems unfounded. The fact that she's bringing up his weight during arguments shows that her feelings are affecting their relationship negatively. Even though she loves him, her actions (keeping him a secret and using weight as a point of contention) could be hurting him.\n\nHowever, she does acknowledge her feelings and the boyfriend is aware. He's trying to make changes, which shows he's not in denial. But the responsibility lies with the author to accept him as he is. Body image issues are personal, but it's not fair to shame someone for it, especially in a relationship. The boyfriend's apology when they argue about this suggests that he's internalizing her shame, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other unconditionally. Feeling ashamed and hiding someone from friends can be seen as disrespectful. The author might need to reflect on her own insecurities or societal pressures that lead to these feelings. The boyfriend's efforts to improve are commendable, but the author should not pressure him to change for her sake. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is indeed in the wrong because she's allowing her personal shame to affect her treatment of a loving partner and their relationship dynamics.\n"
