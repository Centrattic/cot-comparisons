My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're fine with their boyfriend's weight but don't want friends to see him because they feel judged. They also say the boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which affects him. \n\nHmm. Being ashamed of someone for their weight is a common issue, but it's a problem. Even if the author is fine with it themselves, the fact that they feel ashamed and avoid friends meeting him is harmful. The boyfriend is trying, but the author's comments during arguments are making him apologize. That's not healthy. The author's behavior is affecting his self-esteem. \n\nAlso, society often stigmatizes weight, but it's not right to make someone feel bad about their body, especially if they're already trying. The author's actions, even if they're not malicious, are contributing to a negative environment. So even if the author loves him, the shame is a form of emotional harm. \n\nSo I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
