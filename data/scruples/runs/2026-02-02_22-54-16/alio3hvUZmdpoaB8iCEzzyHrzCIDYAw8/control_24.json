My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main issue here is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends because of that. Even though the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, the author brings up the issue during arguments, which affects him emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the problem. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight is a form of body shaming, even if it's not direct. The fact that the author is making their boyfriend apologize for it suggests that the comments are hurtful. The boyfriend is trying to make changes, which shows he's self-aware and wants to improve, but the author's actions are putting pressure on him. \n\nNext, the author's justification is that they don't want to be judged by friends. This reflects more on the author's own insecurities or societal pressures rather than the boyfriend's worth. The relationship is supposed to be supportive, and the author's behavior might be undermining that. Even if the author is \"fine\" with the boyfriend's appearance personally, the act of avoiding friends and bringing it up in arguments is problematic. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's positive traits\u2014like being sweet and prioritizing the author's well-being\u2014contrast with the negative impact of the author's behavior. The author's actions could be contributing to the boyfriend's low self-esteem, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nIt's important to note that while the boyfriend is making efforts, the root issue is the author's feelings of shame, which are inappropriate. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes indicates he feels the comments are valid, which they aren't. The author needs to reflect on their own feelings and how their actions affect their partner. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is indeed in the wrong because their behavior is based on shame and is harming the boyfriend emotionally, despite his efforts to change. The answer should be A.\n"
