My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends, even though the boyfriend is trying to lose weight. The author also brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author is fine with the boyfriend's appearance but feels ashamed when friends see him. That's a personal feeling, but using it to avoid social interactions might be an issue. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve, which shows he's not against changing, but the author is still making it a point during conflicts. That could be harmful because it's using the boyfriend's insecurities against him. \n\nThe key points are: the author is being honest about their feelings but is the behavior inappropriate? Avoiding introducing the boyfriend is about personal comfort, but making it a point of contention in arguments is where things get tricky. Even if the author is okay with the weight, using it to shame the boyfriend during fights is a problem. It can lead to low self-esteem for the boyfriend and create a toxic dynamic. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is trying to work on it, so the author's role in pushing during conflicts might hinder his efforts. The author's shame is their own issue, but projecting that onto their partner and making them feel bad about themselves is where it crosses into being wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are using their partner's insecurities against him during arguments and avoiding social situations due to shame, which can be hurtful and damaging to the relationship.\n"
