My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and avoids showing him to her friends. She loves him and he's making efforts to lose weight, but she still feels ashamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. She's accepting of his weight but doesn't want others to see them. That's a common issue where people might feel self-conscious about their partner's appearance in public. But is that wrong? Well, everyone has their insecurities, but the problem arises when it affects the partner negatively.\n\nShe mentions that when they argue, she brings up his weight as a point, and he apologizes. That's a red flag. Making someone feel bad about their body, even if it's a sensitive topic, can be harmful. The boyfriend is already affected by it, so this behavior is probably contributing to his emotional distress. Even if she's not directly shaming him all the time, using his weight as a leverage in arguments isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is making efforts to improve, which shows he cares about her feelings. But if the root issue is her own shame rather than his weight itself, it's about her own insecurities. The fact that she avoids friends because of his appearance suggests that she's prioritizing her social comfort over his feelings. That's where the problem lies. \n\nAnother angle is that being ashamed of a partner for their body can lead to a lot of pressure on them, which isn't fair. It's important for a relationship to be supportive, and if her shame is causing him to feel like he needs to apologize or change, that's not a healthy dynamic. \n\nIn relationships, it's expected that both partners support each other. If one is making the other feel ashamed or inadequate, that's a sign of an issue. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, are contributing to the boyfriend's emotional state. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because her behavior is causing harm to her partner, even if she doesn't mean to. The shame she feels is affecting their relationship negatively, and she needs to address her own feelings instead of projecting them onto him.\n"
