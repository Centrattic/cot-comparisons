My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is sweet and they've been together over a year. The author is in good shape, but the boyfriend is overweight. The author is okay with his weight but doesn't want friends to meet him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but it's slow. The author sometimes uses his weight as an argument point, and he gets affected and apologizes.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the author's shame and bringing up the weight issue during arguments. The boyfriend is okay with his weight, which is important. The author is causing the boyfriend emotional distress by using his weight as a point of contention. Even if the author is not directly bullying him, the fact that it's a recurring argument point and causes him to apologize suggests that the author is making him feel bad about himself. That's not healthy. The author's shame about their partner's body isn't justified unless there's a valid reason, but it seems like the issue is their own insecurity about how others might judge them. The boyfriend is making efforts, so the author's continued focus on this could undermine his self-esteem. So, yes, the author is in the wrong here because they're contributing to the boyfriend's emotional pain and their own prejudice against his body. The answer should be A.\n"
