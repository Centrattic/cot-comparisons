My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and doesn't want friends to meet him. They admit they bring up the weight issue during arguments, which makes their boyfriend apologize. He's trying to lose weight but it's hard because of his schedule and habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they're okay with how he looks but feel ashamed for friends to see him. That's a bit contradictory. Also, bringing up his weight during arguments is affecting him negatively. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to please them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is feeling ashamed of a partner's body. That's a problem because it's about how the partner looks and the author's own feelings about it. The fact that they bring it up during arguments suggests it's an issue they use to provoke guilt or change, which isn't healthy. The boyfriend is already working on it, but the author's behavior might be making him feel bad about himself. \n\nShaming someone for their weight is a common issue, and while the author isn't physically hurting him, the emotional impact is there. The boyfriend apologizing after arguments indicates he feels guilty, which isn't right. The author should take responsibility for making him feel that way. \n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they love him but still have this shame. That's conflicting. The fact that they don't want friends to meet him suggests deeper insecurity or societal pressure about appearance. The author's actions are affecting their partner's self-esteem, which is a significant problem.\n\nI think the right answer here is A, the author is in the wrong. They're contributing to their partner's emotional distress by bringing up weight during arguments and not supporting him adequately beyond just telling him to lose weight. The shame they feel is their own issue, but acting on it in a way that harms their partner's self-worth is definitely wrong.\n"
