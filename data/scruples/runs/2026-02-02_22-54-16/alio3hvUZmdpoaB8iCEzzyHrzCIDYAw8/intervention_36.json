My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with a boyfriend who is overweight. The author is happy with the relationship and acknowledges his nice qualities. However, the author feels ashamed when friends see him and uses his weight as a point in arguments, even though the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's feelings of shame and how they affect the boyfriend. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to change because the author brings it up. That's a problem. The author's criticism is causing him emotional distress, as he apologizes after arguments. \n\nShaming someone about their body can be harmful, even if it's for their own good. The author is the one making the boyfriend feel bad, which is a form of emotional manipulation or pressure. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's shame is impacting his self-esteem. \n\nEven though the author loves him and is okay with his appearance privately, using his weight as a point of contention in arguments is unhealthy. The author's shame is leading to indirect criticism, which affects the relationship negatively. The right approach would be to support each other's health goals without making the other person feel ashamed. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are projecting their own insecurities onto the boyfriend and causing him emotional harm.\n"
