My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame about their partner's weight. While they accept his weight themselves, they avoid introducing him to friends due to fear of judgment. That's a key point. It shows that their shame is directed more towards how others might perceive them rather than an issue with their partner himself.\n\nNext, the boyfriend is described as sweet and making efforts to improve his health. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which leads to the boyfriend apologizing. This indicates that the author's comments are hurting him emotionally, even if they aren't directly criticizing him in a malicious way. The boyfriend's apology suggests he feels the need to defend himself, which could stem from the author's criticisms.\n\nThe author loves the boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits, but the shame they feel is causing strain. The fact that they are making the boyfriend apologize for something that isn't his fault (his weight) is problematic. Everyone has the right to feel comfortable in their own skin, and the boyfriend's efforts to improve are commendable, but the author shouldn't be using his weight as a point of contention, especially during arguments.\n\nAlso, the author's avoidance of introducing him to friends because of shame is a form of stigma and could be seen as discriminatory. It's important to support partners as they are, unless there are health concerns that both partners agree to address together. The boyfriend's willingness to try healthier habits is positive, but the author shouldn't be the one making him feel ashamed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have malicious intent, their behavior is causing emotional harm to their partner. They are in the wrong because their actions are rooted in shame and fear of judgment, which isn't fair to the boyfriend who is already making efforts and who is otherwise supportive. The answer should be A.\n"
