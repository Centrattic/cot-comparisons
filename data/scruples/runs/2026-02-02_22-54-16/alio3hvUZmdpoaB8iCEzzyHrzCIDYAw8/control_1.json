My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and making weight an issue during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they're fine with how their boyfriend looks but don't want their friends to see him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which upsets him. He's okay with his body but is affected by her comments.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's behavior. Even if they're not directly mean, making someone feel ashamed about their body, especially when it's a point of contention in arguments, is problematic. The boyfriend is already making efforts, but the author is using his weight as a point of contention. That's not healthy in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author hides the boyfriend from friends out of shame shows a lack of acceptance and support. Relationships should be about mutual respect and acceptance. If the author is causing emotional distress by focusing on his weight, that's a problem. Even if the boyfriend isn't upset about his own body, the author's actions are affecting him negatively.\n\nThe boyfriend is trying to change his habits, which is commendable, but the author shouldn't be using that as leverage. It's not the boyfriend's fault for being overweight, and the author's shaming could be contributing to his low self-esteem. The author's justification about not wanting to be judged by friends is a form of shaming that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They're being ashamed of their partner and using his weight as an argument point, which is harmful. The right approach would be to support him and address the issue of their friends' judgment without shaming him.\n"
