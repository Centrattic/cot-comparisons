My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They mention that they avoid friends meeting him due to fear of judgment, and even though the boyfriend is okay with his appearance, the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits, but there's an issue with them feeling ashamed. They also admit to using his weight as an argument point, which is making him apologize. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's hard for him.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong here. Feeling ashamed might be a personal feeling, but acting on it by criticizing or using it as an argument is where it could go wrong. The author is making their partner feel bad about themselves, even if unintentionally. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health might be driven by the author's comments rather than his own desire. That could be harmful, as it's not his issue to fix for someone else's comfort.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is avoiding friends meeting their partner suggests that they're prioritizing their own social anxiety over their partner's feelings. This could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author is fine with how he looks, the shame they feel is causing emotional harm. The boyfriend apologizing when the issue is brought up indicates that he feels it's a problem, even if he's usually okay with himself.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's behavior, not just their feelings. While they might not be malicious, they are contributing to their partner's emotional distress. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're making their partner's self-esteem an issue in the relationship and not addressing their own insecurities constructively.\n"
