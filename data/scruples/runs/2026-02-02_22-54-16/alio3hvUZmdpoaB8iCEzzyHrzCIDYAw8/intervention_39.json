My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend feeling ashamed, even though she's okay with his appearance. She avoids introducing him to friends due to fear of judgment. He's trying to lose weight but struggling with a busy schedule. She brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal ethics. Being ashamed of someone because of their appearance can be problematic. It's important to respect a partner's dignity and not make them feel bad about themselves. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve, so the fact that the author is using his weight as an argument point might be hurtful. Even if she's not outwardly critical, the underlying shame is there, which can erode self-esteem over time.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being impacted. He apologizes after arguments about his weight, which suggests he's internalizing her criticism. Healthy relationships require support and encouragement. If the author is causing emotional distress under the guise of caring, that's a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions she loves him and he's a good person. Her intention might not be to harm, but the effect is there. The key issue is whether the shame she feels is justified. Since body image issues are often not the person's fault and can be influenced by many factors, judging someone for their weight can be seen as superficial and unfair. \n\nSo, even if she's not outright mean, the emotional impact on him is significant. The underlying message is that his body is a problem, which can lead to negative self-image and stress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because her actions and feelings are contributing to his emotional distress, regardless of her intentions.\n"
