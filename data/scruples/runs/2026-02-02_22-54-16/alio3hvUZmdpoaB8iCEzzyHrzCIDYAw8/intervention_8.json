My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they're ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoid introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight. The author says they love him and he's a good person. However, during arguments, the author brings up his weight, which affects him emotionally.\n\nHmm, so being ashamed of someone for their body size is a sensitive issue. Weight can be a personal and emotional topic. Even if the author is trying to support their partner by discussing it, doing so during arguments might not be healthy. It sounds like the boyfriend is making efforts to improve, but the author's shame is causing him to feel insecure, which isn't fair.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the boyfriend and the underlying shame. The author might not realize that their feelings of shame could be harmful. They love him, but their actions (bringing up the weight during arguments) are affecting his self-esteem. That seems like a problem. Even if the boyfriend isn't completely upset, the fact that he apologizes instantly suggests he's hurt by it.\n\nAlso, avoiding friends because of his weight shows a lack of acceptance. A healthy relationship should support each other's strengths, not hide due to insecurities. The author's behavior might be contributing to the boyfriend's stress, even if unintentionally. It's important to consider how one's feelings and actions affect their partner's self-worth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions stem from shame and could be harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
