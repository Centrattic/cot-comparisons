Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged.

However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and not wanting friends to meet him, even though they love him and he's making efforts to change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits they're ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, which already points to a possible issue. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but progress is slow. The author uses the boyfriend's weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful. The boyfriend is affected by this and apologizes, which shows that the comments are impacting him negatively.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, shaming someone for their body, even if it's your partner, is generally considered wrong. The fact that the author is in a healthy shape and the boyfriend is overweight might lead to insecurities, but that doesn't justify feeling ashamed or using it as a point of contention in arguments. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's actions\u2014like not wanting friends to meet him and bringing up weight during arguments\u2014are likely hurting him. \n\nThe author's justification is that they're okay with his appearance but don't want judgment from friends. However, this is a personal insecurity that can affect the relationship's health. It's important to recognize that body shaming, even if not overt, can be damaging. The boyfriend's apology when the issue is raised suggests that it's a sensitive topic for him, and the author should be mindful of that. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. If the author is truly okay with his weight, then their hesitation to introduce him to friends is more about their own feelings of shame rather than any real issue with the boyfriend. This internal conflict might need addressing through self-reflection or counseling to ensure the relationship remains healthy and respectful.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are allowing their own insecurities to affect their treatment of their partner and the relationship dynamics.\n"
