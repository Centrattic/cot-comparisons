My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids friends meeting him, even though they acknowledge he's sweet and trying to improve. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but the author uses it as a point in arguments, which affects him.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider if shaming someone for their weight is wrong. Weight stigma is a real issue, and even if the author is okay with it privately, publicly avoiding him or making it a point during arguments can be harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's self-conscious, so the author's behavior might be contributing to his self-esteem issues. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't want friends to see him because they feel judged. That's a form of social shaming, which can be hurtful. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing him, avoiding friends' meetings because of his weight implies that his size is a problem in their relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend apologizing when it's brought up during arguments is a red flag. It suggests that the author's comments are making him feel guilty or inadequate. Healthy relationships shouldn't have one person feeling ashamed or needing to apologize for their body. \n\nI think the key points here are about respect and mutual support. The author's behavior, while maybe not overtly cruel, is still rooted in shame and could be damaging to the boyfriend's self-worth. Even if the author isn't the \"villain,\" they are contributing to a dynamic where the boyfriend feels he needs to change for the relationship to be accepted. \n\nSo, even if the author has good intentions, the impact of their actions is negative. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they are shaming their partner and using it as a point of contention, which isn't respectful.\n"
