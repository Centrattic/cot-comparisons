My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids friends meeting him, even though she's fine with his appearance herself. She mentions that he's making efforts to lose weight but it's slow. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about being ashamed of someone else's body and how that affects them. Even if she's okay with his weight, the fact that she doesn't want her friends to see him because of shame is problematic. She's projecting her own feelings onto him, and using his weight as an argument point is hurtful. The boyfriend is affected by this, apologizing instantly, which shows it's hurting him emotionally.\n\nEven if she loves him and he's sweet, the act of making him feel ashamed or using his body as a point of conflict is wrong. Body shaming is a form of bullying and can lead to low self-esteem. The fact that he's trying to change his habits shows he's aware of her concerns, but it's not his responsibility to fix her feelings of shame. The author's actions contribute to his emotional distress. So, yes, she's in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
