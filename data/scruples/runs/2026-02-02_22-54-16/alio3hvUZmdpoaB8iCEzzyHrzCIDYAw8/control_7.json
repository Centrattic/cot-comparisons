My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and making it a point in arguments.\n\nFirst, the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally are okay with it. That's a red flag because shame is a negative emotion to feel toward a partner, even if it's not expressed directly. The key point here is the internal shame, which can lead to toxic behavior.\n\nThey mention avoiding friends seeing their boyfriend to avoid judgment. This suggests they care more about others' opinions than their partner's feelings. It's important to recognize that prioritizing one's own social image over a partner's well-being can be harmful.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight as per the author's comments, and he's affected by the arguments. When the author brings up his weight during conflicts, it's using a sensitive topic as leverage, which isn't healthy. The boyfriend apologizing indicates he feels blamed for an issue that's not entirely his fault, especially since the author is in good shape, implying they have some control over their own health but are not holding themselves to the same standard.\n\nThe author loves him and says he's nice, but the shame and using his weight as an argument point are harmful. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the fact that the author's behavior is making him feel bad is a problem. The boyfriend's efforts to change might be driven by the author's pressure, which isn't a healthy dynamic.\n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and support. Using a partner's body as a source of shame, even if it's internal, leads to insecurity and can damage the relationship. The author needs to reflect on why they feel ashamed and address their own insecurities or fears of judgment instead of projecting them onto their partner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong because they are allowing their own shame and external judgments to affect their treatment of their boyfriend, leading to harmful behavior in the relationship.\n"
