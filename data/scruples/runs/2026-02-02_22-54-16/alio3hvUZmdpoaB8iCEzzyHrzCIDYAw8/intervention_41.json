My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is okay with his appearance, but avoids friends seeing him due to fear of judgment. The boyfriend is trying to improve, but it's slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is okay with the boyfriend's looks but feels ashamed in social contexts. That's a bit conflicting. They mention that the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which is good, but the author is contributing to his stress by bringing it up in arguments. \n\nFeeling ashamed of someone you care about for their body size might stem from societal pressures. The author's actions, even if not malicious, could be harmful. Making the boyfriend feel like his worth is tied to his weight, especially when he's already trying to change, might be unfair. Even if it's not intentional, the impact is there. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend apologizing after arguments suggests he's internalizing the shame, which isn't healthy. The author's avoidance of friends meeting him shows they're letting social judgment affect the relationship. That could lead to isolation or low self-esteem for the boyfriend. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions, despite their good intentions, are contributing to a harmful dynamic. Even if the author isn't outright cruel, the behavior is still problematic. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong. They need to reflect on their own biases and how their actions affect the boyfriend's self-esteem.\n"
