My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and the author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend because of shame. Even though the author says they're fine with how he looks, the shame is evident. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's hard, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's feelings of shame and their impact on the boyfriend. Even if the author loves him and thinks he's nice, feeling ashamed of his appearance is problematic. It's a form of judgment based on physical traits, which can be considered unfair or hurtful. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author is using his weight as an argument point, which could be emotionally damaging. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014apologizing immediately\u2014suggests that the author's comments are hurtful. The fact that the author avoids friends seeing him because of shame implies that their self-esteem or social standards are making the boyfriend feel inadequate. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the underlying shame is a negative emotion that's affecting the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, being ashamed of a partner for traits they can't control (like weight, though it's often complex) is generally seen as wrong. It's important to support each other without judgment. The boyfriend's efforts to improve might be commendable, but the author's shame might be contributing to his stress. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions aren't malicious, the effect is harmful. The question is about being in the wrong, which relates to the impact of their actions. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
