My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They've been together over a year, and the boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate. The author is okay with his appearance but avoids showing him to friends due to feeling judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but hasn't made much progress because of a busy schedule and habits. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which makes him apologize.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's feelings of shame are personal, but does that make them wrong? People can feel ashamed for various reasons, but acting on those feelings in a way that affects the other person's self-esteem is problematic. The boyfriend is making an effort, which shows he cares, and the author is contributing to his emotional distress by bringing up the weight during arguments. Even if the author is \"fine\" with his looks, the fact that they avoid friends and use his weight as an argument point when things get tense is where the issue lies.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how our actions affect the partner. Using someone's body size as an argument point is not healthy. The boyfriend's apology after such mentions suggests that it's hurting him, which is a red flag. The author's behavior, even if not outwardly cruel, is still making the boyfriend feel inadequate and affecting his efforts. This dynamic can lead to the boyfriend internalizing the shame and possibly developing a negative self-image, which is harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because they are perpetuating a harmful situation despite their positive feelings towards the boyfriend. The answer should be A.\n"
