My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is body image and how the author's feelings are impacting the relationship. The boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, but the author's shame is causing problems. Even though the author says they're fine with how he looks, their actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument point) contradict that. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve, but the author's comments during arguments seem hurtful and possibly unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relational standpoint, making someone feel ashamed about their body, especially when they're already trying to improve, can be harmful. It's possible that the author's behavior is contributing to the boyfriend's low self-esteem, even if unintentionally. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes after arguments suggests he's taking the comments to heart, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, the author's shame about their partner's appearance, regardless of their own feelings, is a problem. It's important for a partner to support each other without conditions. The author might need to reflect on why they feel this way and seek to address those feelings constructively, perhaps through open communication or personal reflection. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that the boyfriend isn't upset about his weight and is making efforts. But the author's actions are still causing discomfort. Even if the boyfriend is okay with himself, the author's behavior affects their dynamic. The key here is that the author's actions are causing the boyfriend emotional distress, which is a significant issue regardless of the boyfriend's current efforts. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because their behavior is harmful and not supportive. The right answer would be A.\n"
