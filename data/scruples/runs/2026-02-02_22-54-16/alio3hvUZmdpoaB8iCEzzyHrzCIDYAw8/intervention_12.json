My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author avoids introducing him to friends, and sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims to be fine with the boyfriend's appearance but feels ashamed when others see them. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, which shows he's self-aware. The author loves him and says he's the nicest guy, but the shame is causing issues.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is about self-respect and mutual respect in a relationship. Being ashamed of a partner's body, even if it's not directly stated as a criticism, can be hurtful. The boyfriend is affected by the author's comments, which suggests that it's impacting their emotional well-being. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the underlying shame might be a form of subtle disrespect. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author avoids introducing the boyfriend to friends because of his weight indicates a lack of acceptance. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other unconditionally. The author's actions, despite loving the boyfriend, might be undermining that support. \n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to lose weight are commendable, but the author's focus on his weight could be contributing to his stress. It's possible that the author's own insecurities or societal pressures are influencing their feelings. However, projecting those feelings onto the partner isn't fair. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong (A) because their shame is affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem and the relationship dynamics. Alternatively, if the author isn't directly criticizing him but just feeling personal shame, maybe it's not entirely their fault (B). But since the boyfriend is hurt by the comments, even if the author is well-meaning, it's still an issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the shame is causing emotional harm. However, there's nuance here. The author's intentions are good, but the impact is negative. So the answer might be A, but the user might need to consider that their feelings, while understandable, are affecting the relationship adversely.\n"
