My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a person whose boyfriend is overweight. She's okay with how he looks but feels ashamed when friends see him. She's causing him emotional distress by bringing up his weight during arguments, making him apologize. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's hard because of his schedule and habits. He's actually okay with his appearance, but she's pushing him to change, which is affecting him negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue here: body shaming. The author's feelings of shame about her boyfriend's weight are leading her to make him feel bad, even though she says she's fine with it. The fact that she brings it up during arguments and he apologizes shows that her comments are hurting him. Even if he's trying to lose weight, the pressure from her could be harmful. \n\nIn relationships, respect and support are crucial. If someone is making their partner feel ashamed or inadequate, that's a red flag. The boyfriend's efforts to change are commendable, but they shouldn't be driven by the partner's dissatisfaction. The author's actions might be undermining his self-esteem, which is not healthy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she hides him from friends because of his weight is a problem. It's not the boyfriend's fault for being how he is, and making him feel like he's not good enough to be seen with friends is unfair. The boyfriend's being affected by this and apologizing shows that the dynamic is toxic in that aspect.\n\nEven though she loves him and he's a good person, her behavior is not supportive. Healthy relationships don't involve shaming each other about appearance. So, the answer is likely that she's in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
