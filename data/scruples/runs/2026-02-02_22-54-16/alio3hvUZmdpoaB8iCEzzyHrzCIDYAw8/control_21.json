My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is ashamed of their boyfriend for being fat, even though they love him and he's a good guy. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is feeling ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but acting on it by bringing it up during arguments and avoiding friends is problematic. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is trying to change for the author's sake. That shows he cares about her feelings, but the author's behavior might be making him feel insecure.\n\nShaming someone for their body, even if it's unintentionally, is generally considered wrong. It's about respecting the other person's autonomy and self-esteem. Even if the author is not overtly cruel, using it as a point in arguments can be hurtful. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes when this happens suggests that it's affecting his self-worth.\n\nAlso, the author is in a good shape, which might contribute to a power imbalance where the boyfriend feels he needs to change to meet her standards. The key issue here is that the author's shame is causing emotional harm to her partner. Even if she's not malicious, the impact is negative. Relationships require mutual respect, and making someone feel ashamed for who they are can be damaging.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
