My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally accept him. They don't want their friends to see him and sometimes bring up the weight during arguments, which affects him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but progress is slow.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive qualities. The issue is the author's personal shame, which leads to avoiding friends and bringing up weight during arguments. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is making efforts to lose weight. The arguments might be using the boyfriend's weight as a point, which can be hurtful even if it's not intentional.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and healthy relationships. It's important in relationships to support each other's well-being without making the other person feel bad about themselves. The fact that the author is ashamed and uses the boyfriend's weight as an argument point could be harmful. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the author's behavior might undermine his efforts and self-esteem. \n\nThe boyfriend is making an effort, but the author's actions during arguments might be making him feel like he's not good enough, leading to apologies. This could indicate that the author is projecting their own insecurities or societal pressures onto the relationship. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and avoiding body shaming, even if it's done by someone close.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position where they are comfortable accepting their boyfriend's appearance but are still embarrassed when others see him. This might stem from their own internalized biases or fear of judgment from friends. However, it's important to address those feelings and work towards being comfortable with their partner in all situations. \n\nThe fact that the author brings up the weight as an argument point is problematic. Using someone's weight as a way to win an argument, even if it's a sensitive topic, can be manipulative or hurtful. The boyfriend's instant apology suggests he feels guilty or ashamed, which the author might be perpetuating without realizing it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not intend to be cruel, their actions (using weight as an argument point and feeling ashamed) contribute to a dynamic where the boyfriend's self-esteem is affected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are not supporting their partner in a healthy way and are allowing their own insecurities to impact the relationship negatively.\n"
