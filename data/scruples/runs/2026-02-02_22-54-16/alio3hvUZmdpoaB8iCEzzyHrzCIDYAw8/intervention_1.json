My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The author admits they're ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoid introducing him to friends. They mention their boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but isn't making progress due to his schedule and habits. The author says they love him and he's sweet.\n\nHmm, shame is a strong emotion. Even if they say they're okay with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends) show they're embarrassed. The boyfriend is trying to change, but the author is using his weight as a point in arguments, which can hurt him. Even if it's not intentional, making someone feel they need to change for acceptance isn't right. The author's shame could be affecting his self-esteem, especially since he's already self-conscious. The key here is whether shaming someone for something they can't control, even indirectly, is wrong. I think it is. So the answer should be A.\n"
