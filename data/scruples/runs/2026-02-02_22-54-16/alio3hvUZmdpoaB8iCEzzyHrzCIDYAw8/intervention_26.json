My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight and avoiding friends seeing him. The author says they love him and he's sweet, but they feel judged by friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about the key points. The author is ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but the issue here is whether that feeling is justified or if it's harmful. They admit they're not okay with others seeing their boyfriend, which could imply they're uncomfortable with his weight affecting their social interactions. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve, but the author's comments during arguments might be hurting him. \n\nThe question is about moral responsibility. Is the author in the wrong for feeling ashamed? Well, feelings themselves aren't wrong, but how you act on them. If the author is making the boyfriend feel bad about himself, especially when he's already working on his health, that's a problem. The fact that he apologizes after arguments suggests he's hurt by her comments. Even though the author says they're okay with his looks, the behavior (avoiding friends, bringing it up in arguments) is likely affecting his self-esteem. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he prioritizes her well-being, which is good, but it's a two-way relationship. His efforts to change his habits might be influenced by her feelings, which could be a form of pressure. The key here is that the author's shame is causing emotional harm to her boyfriend. Even if she's not outright abusive, creating an environment where he feels he needs to change for her acceptance is problematic. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might be good (she loves him), the effect of her actions is negative. The answer would be that she is in the wrong because her behavior is contributing to his low self-esteem and potentially his stress, despite his efforts to improve. The shame she feels is her own issue, but it's affecting their relationship negatively.\n"
