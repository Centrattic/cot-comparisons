My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him because of that.\n\nFirst, the author says they're fine with their boyfriend's appearance but don't want friends to see him. That's a key point. They also mention that the boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is struggling with his schedule and habits. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which makes him apologize instantly. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, which shows he's trying to please the author. The fact that he apologizes suggests he's internalizing the criticism, which isn't healthy. The author's shame is affecting the relationship negatively. Even though they love him and find him nice, their actions are based on personal discomfort rather than the boyfriend's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without shame or judgment. The author's behavior might be contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues. Being ashamed of a partner for something they can't fully control (like weight) is discriminatory and unhealthy. The boyfriend's efforts to change because of the author's desire to avoid judgment indicate manipulation and lack of genuine support.\n\nSo, even though the author loves him, the underlying issue is the judgment and the effect on the boyfriend's self-worth. That makes the author at fault here. The answer should be A.\n"
