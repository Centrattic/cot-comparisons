My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. So, the main issue here is about body image and how the author's feelings affect her relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is sweet and always puts her first. He's trying to lose weight, even though it's slow because of his schedule and habits. The author feels ashamed when friends meet him, even though she's okay with his appearance herself. She brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. The key points here are her shame leading to judgment, the emotional impact on her boyfriend, and the fact that she's using his weight as an argument point.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and empathy, being ashamed of someone for their body can be problematic. It's about respecting others' bodies and not making them feel inadequate. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the fact that the author brings it up during arguments and makes him feel bad suggests that her behavior is harmful. It's important to consider how her words affect his self-esteem and their relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but it's not working quickly. The author might be contributing to his stress by using his weight as a point of contention. Even if she's not directly criticizing him, the fact that she feels ashamed and uses it in arguments can be emotionally abusive. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and support, not making someone feel ashamed for things outside their control, like weight, even if they're trying to change.\n\nSo, even though the author loves him and he's a nice guy, her actions are still hurting him. The answer here would likely be that she is in the wrong because she's projecting her insecurities onto him and using his appearance as a tool in arguments, which is not healthy.\n"
