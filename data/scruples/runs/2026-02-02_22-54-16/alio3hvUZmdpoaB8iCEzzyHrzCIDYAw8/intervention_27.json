My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids showing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) means here. Typically, it's about whether the person's actions are considered morally wrong or inconsiderate. The author is ashamed, which is an emotion, but acting on that shame by avoiding friends and bringing up the issue during arguments could be problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, which the author acknowledges. However, using his weight as a point in arguments and making him feel bad might be emotionally harmful. Even though the author says they're okay with his appearance, the fact that they're shamed in front of friends and during conflicts could indicate that the author's actions are affecting his self-esteem negatively. \n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the boyfriend, the use of his appearance as a weapon in arguments, and the author's own shame versus acceptance. While the author might not be outright cruel, their behavior is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. It's important to note that shaming someone for their weight, even if it's not explicit, can be harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits show he cares about the relationship, yet the author's reactions might undermine his efforts and self-worth.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other's well-being without judgment. The author's actions, while stemming from their own insecurities, might be placing unnecessary pressure on the boyfriend. Even if the author isn't malicious, the effect of their behavior is causing emotional harm. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their actions are detrimental to the boyfriend's emotional health and the relationship's dynamics.\n"
