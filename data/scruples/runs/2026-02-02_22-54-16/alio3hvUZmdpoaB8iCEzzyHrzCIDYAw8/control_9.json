My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The user makes their boyfriend feel bad during arguments by bringing up his weight, even though they claim they're okay with his appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The person admits they don't want their friends to meet their boyfriend because they feel ashamed. Even though they say they're fine with how he looks, the underlying issue is their own feelings of shame affecting the relationship. The boyfriend is trying to change, but the user is using his weight as a point in arguments. That's a problem because it's using a personal trait that's hard to control as a weapon in conflicts. It's not his fault for being overweight, and using that to guilt-trip him during arguments is unfair. Also, the fact that the user is worried about being judged by friends for being with someone who is overweight shows an insecurity from their side. Even if they love him, making him apologize when they bring up his weight is not healthy. The boyfriend's feelings are being hurt, which suggests that the user's behavior is harmful. Societally, body shaming is a serious issue, and even if it's not outrightly shaming, the underlying shame and using it as an argument point is wrong. The user's actions are contributing to the boyfriend's low self-esteem and making him feel like he needs to change to be acceptable. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The user is not in the right because they are projecting their own insecurities onto their partner and making him feel bad for something he's already trying to address. They should address their own feelings of shame instead of burdening him.\n"
