My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit-style question is at fault here. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they personally accept him. They avoid introducing him to friends and sometimes bring up his weight during arguments, which affects him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits they're ashamed, which is a judgment of their partner. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is making an effort. However, the author uses his weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful. Even if the author doesn't mean to be cruel, bringing up someone's insecurities during arguments is not healthy. \n\nAlso, feeling ashamed of someone for their body can be seen as a form of body shaming, regardless of how much the person accepts it otherwise. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's comments might be adding pressure. Even if the author loves him, the behavior (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument) is problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend apologizing suggests that he feels guilty about his weight, which the author's comments are contributing to. So, even if the author's intentions are not malicious, the effect on the boyfriend is negative. In relationships, it's important to support each other without causing harm. So the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
