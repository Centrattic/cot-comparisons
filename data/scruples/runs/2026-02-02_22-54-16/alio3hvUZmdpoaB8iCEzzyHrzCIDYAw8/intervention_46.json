My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The context is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and they're together for over a year. The author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend due to feeling judged. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but tries to lose it, and the author sometimes brings up the weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nHmm. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion. So, first, I need to assess if shaming someone for their weight is wrong. Weight stigma is a real issue, and making someone feel ashamed can affect their self-esteem and mental health. Even if the author is \"fine\" with his looks, the fact that she feels ashamed and uses his weight as an argument point is problematic. The boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise show he's trying, but the author's actions might be undermining him. Also, when arguments happen, bringing up his weight as a point is hurtful. The boyfriend apologizing indicates he feels it's his fault, which isn't fair. The author's friends not meeting him because of shame suggests she's prioritizing her feelings over his. Relationships should be about support, not shame. Even if she loves him, shaming him for something he's struggling with isn't healthy. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong). But maybe consider if there's a nuance. However, the key points are the shame and using it as an argument point. Yeah, that's definitely wrong.\n"
