My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends, even though the boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making progress. The author also uses his weight as an argument point during fights, which hurts him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims to be fine with the boyfriend's appearance but feels shame when friends see him. That's a contradiction because if they're okay with him, why the shame? The boyfriend is making efforts, which the author acknowledges, but the author still brings up his weight in arguments. That could be hurtful and not supportive.\n\nThe boyfriend's feelings are being affected, and he apologizes instantly, which suggests he feels bad about himself. The author might be contributing to his self-esteem issues. Even if the author loves the boyfriend, making him feel ashamed about his body is problematic. Body image issues can stem from such comments. Also, the fact that the author avoids friends meeting him shows a lack of confidence in their relationship, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe boyfriend's efforts are commendable, but the author is focusing on his weight as a problem, which might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's own insecurities or societal pressures are influencing their behavior. The key is whether the author is being supportive or making the boyfriend feel inadequate. Since the author is using the weight as an argument point, that's a red flag. Supportive relationships shouldn't have that. So, the answer would be AITA for the author.\n"
