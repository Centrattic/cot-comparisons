My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nFirst, the user mentions they're okay with the boyfriend's weight themselves but don't want friends to see him because they don't want to be judged. That's a key point. Even if they personally accept him, their shame is causing emotional impact on him. \n\nThe boyfriend is making an effort to lose weight, but it's slow. The author brings up his weight during arguments, which he takes as criticism. He apologizes after that, which shows he's hurt. So the author's actions are affecting his self-esteem.\n\nNow, the author says they love him and he's a sweet guy. But their shame is leading to behavior that harms the relationship. Even if they think they're fine with it, the fact that they feel ashamed and it's causing conflict might be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, respecting your partner's feelings is important. Making someone feel bad about their body, even indirectly, can be harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to improve might be driven by the pressure from the author's comments, which isn't a healthy dynamic. \n\nSo, the author is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress by letting their own insecurity about social judgment affect the relationship. That seems like being in the wrong. The answer is probably A.\n"
