My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're in a relationship with their boyfriend, who is overweight. The author is okay with his weight but doesn't want their friends to meet him because they feel ashamed. They also mention bringing up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if feeling ashamed about a partner's weight is wrong. The author is fine with his appearance but doesn't want friends to meet him. That seems like an internal issue, but the key part here is that the author is making their boyfriend feel bad by bringing up his weight during arguments. The boyfriend is okay with his weight and is trying to lose it, but the author's comments are affecting him negatively.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being. If the author is making the boyfriend feel like he needs to apologize for something he's already accepted about himself, that's not supportive. Even if the author is trying to help him lose weight, using it as an argument point is likely harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise are there, but the author's comments might be undermining his confidence.\n\nThere's also the aspect of body shaming. The author might not be overtly shaming him, but their discomfort with friends meeting him and using his weight as an issue in arguments suggests a form of judgment. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes shows that the author's words have emotional impact, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author feels conflicted and loves their boyfriend, their actions are contributing to his emotional distress. The right approach would be to support his efforts without making him feel ashamed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are causing emotional harm through their behavior.\n"
