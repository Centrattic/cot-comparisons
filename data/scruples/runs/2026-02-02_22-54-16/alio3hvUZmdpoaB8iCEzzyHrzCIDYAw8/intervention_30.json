My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. First, I need to consider the key points from the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that she's fine with her boyfriend's appearance but avoids friends seeing him because she's worried about being judged. This seems like internalized shame or concern about societal judgment. She also says that when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him negatively. He's making efforts to lose weight but it's slow due to his schedule and habits. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, shaming someone for their weight, even if it's not direct, can be harmful. Even if she's not directly telling him he's fat, the fact that she avoids friends seeing him and uses his weight as an argument point suggests that her behavior is contributing to his emotional distress. The boyfriend is affected by her comments and apologizes, which indicates that her actions are hurting him. \n\nThe author loves him and acknowledges his kindness, but her actions (avoiding friends and bringing up weight during arguments) are problematic. It's not about the weight itself but about how she's allowing her own insecurities or societal pressures to affect their relationship. Healthy relationships require support and encouragement, not shame or using body image as a point of contention. Even if her intentions are good (like wanting him to lose weight), the way she's handling it is harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because her behavior is causing emotional harm, even if she's not outright shaming him. The key factors are avoiding friends due to shame and using weight as an argument point, which are both negative actions in a relationship.\n"
