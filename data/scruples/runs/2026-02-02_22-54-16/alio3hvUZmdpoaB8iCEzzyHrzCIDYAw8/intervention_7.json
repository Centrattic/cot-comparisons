My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, and the author avoids showing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight, though progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight in arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if being ashamed is inherently wrong. The author says they're fine with how he looks, but the shame is about friends judging them. That's a common issue where people worry about social perception. However, making someone feel ashamed of their body, even if it's not directly criticizing them, can be problematic. The boyfriend is already trying to change, and the author's behavior might be contributing to his stress.\n\nAlso, using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point is definitely an issue. Even if the author has good intentions, using someone's body as a point of contention in disagreements can harm the relationship. The boyfriend apologizing suggests he feels hurt or guilty, which isn't healthy. The author's actions might be undermining his self-esteem and efforts.\n\nThe key here is whether the shame is justified. While the author isn't directly insulting their boyfriend, the emotional impact is still there. The fact that the author is okay with his looks but still feels ashamed creates a contradiction. It's possible the author's own insecurities or societal pressures are influencing their feelings. The boyfriend's efforts to improve show he's self-aware, but the author's behavior could be a hindrance rather than help.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions aren't malicious, the effect on the boyfriend is negative. In relationships, it's important to support each other without guilt or shame. The author might need to address their own feelings and how they express them to avoid hurting their partner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress, even if unintentionally.\n"
