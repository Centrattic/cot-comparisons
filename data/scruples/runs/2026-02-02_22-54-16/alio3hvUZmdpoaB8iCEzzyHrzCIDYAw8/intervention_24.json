My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. The situation is that she's in a one-year relationship with a sweet guy who's making efforts to lose weight, but she avoids her friends seeing him because she's ashamed. He's okay with his looks but she brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author admits she's ashamed, which is a feeling, but she's also the one causing emotional distress to her boyfriend by bringing up his weight during arguments. Even though she says she's fine with how he looks, her actions (avoiding friends meeting him and bringing up the issue in fights) are negative. The boyfriend is trying to make changes, but progress is slow, and she's making him apologize for it. That seems unfair because it's not his fault he's busy or has habits to overcome.\n\nThe key points are: she's ashamed, which leads to her making him feel bad, and he's affected by it. Even if she loves him, the fact that she's using his weight as a point of contention in arguments and avoiding social interactions with her friends shows a lack of support. Body image issues in relationships can be harmful, especially when one partner feels judged. The author's actions are causing emotional harm, which might be the crux of her being in the wrong. So, the answer is AITA for the author. She's not supporting her partner's efforts and is contributing to his insecurities.\n"
