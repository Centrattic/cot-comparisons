Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship where their boyfriend is overweight. The author mentions they're fine with his looks but feel ashamed when friends see him. They also say they occasionally bring up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow progress.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the author's feelings of shame, bringing up weight as an argument point, and the boyfriend's emotional response. The boyfriend is making efforts, which the author acknowledges. The author loves him and he's described as a sweet guy. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about societal standards. Body image issues are common, but it's important to consider how one's actions affect their partner. The author is making the boyfriend feel bad, using his weight as a point of contention during arguments. Even if the author isn't directly calling him fat, bringing it up in arguments can be hurtful. The boyfriend apologizing suggests that he feels guilty or ashamed, which isn't healthy for a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author is avoiding friends meeting him because of his weight. That's about the author's comfort rather than the boyfriend's worth. It's the author's insecurity that's causing the shame, not the boyfriend's actions. The boyfriend is trying to improve, so the author's actions might be undermining his efforts in a negative way. \n\nFrom a relationship health perspective, it's not okay to make someone feel ashamed of themselves. Even if the author's intentions are good (like wanting to support him), the method of using weight as an argument point and causing shame is harmful. Healthy relationships involve support and encouragement without judgment. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes shows that the dynamic is unhealthy in this aspect.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is contributing to the boyfriend's low self-esteem by making him feel ashamed. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
