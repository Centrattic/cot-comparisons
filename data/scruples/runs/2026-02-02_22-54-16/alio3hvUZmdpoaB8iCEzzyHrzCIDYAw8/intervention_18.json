My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him. The author mentions they're okay with his looks but feel judged by friends. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but progress is slow. The author sometimes uses his weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's feelings of shame, using the boyfriend's weight as an argument, and the impact on his self-esteem. Even though the author loves him and he's generally good, the act of shaming someone for their body, even if it's internalized and not outward, can be harmful. The boyfriend is already affected by it, which shows it's impacting their relationship negatively. \n\nBut wait, the author is honest about their feelings and has discussed it with him. They also acknowledge he's making efforts. However, being ashamed and using someone's body as a point of contention in arguments isn't healthy. It can contribute to low self-esteem and might be a form of body shaming, even if it's not verbalized to others. \n\nThe boyfriend's efforts might be in response to the author's comments, which could indicate that the author's actions are influencing him negatively. So even if the author isn't outright cruel, their internal shame and using it as an argument point is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's self-esteem. If the author feels ashamed to introduce their partner to friends because of appearance, that's a personal issue they need to address. It's not the boyfriend's fault for his weight, and the author's actions, even if well-meaning, can be harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they are contributing to the boyfriend's insecurity and using his body as a point of conflict. Even if they're not outwardly shaming others, their internal feelings and behavior are affecting the relationship adversely. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
