My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits. However, the shame aspect is causing them to hide him from friends. The boyfriend is aware and is making efforts, but the author's comments during arguments affect him negatively.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, body shaming is generally considered unacceptable. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, the fact that their feelings of shame are leading to the boyfriend's apologies and emotional distress suggests that the author's behavior is problematic. The author's actions are affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem, even if the boyfriend is trying to change his habits. The key issue is the author's treatment of the boyfriend, not just their own feelings. So while the author might not feel malicious, their behavior contributes to a harmful dynamic. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
