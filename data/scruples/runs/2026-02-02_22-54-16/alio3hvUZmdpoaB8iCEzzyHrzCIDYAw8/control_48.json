      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The question is an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario where the author is ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend is described as the sweetest guy, always prioritizing the author's well-being. He's making an effort to lose weight, even though progress is slow due to his busy schedule and habits. The author is okay with his appearance but feels ashamed when friends meet him. They sometimes bring up his weight during arguments, and he apologizes each time. The author loves him and says he's the nicest guy they've met.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame and bringing up their boyfriend's weight during arguments. Even though the author claims to be fine with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends meeting him and using weight as an argument point) show a lack of support. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are acknowledged, but the author's behavior might be undermining those efforts. \n\nShaming someone for their body, especially in a relationship where you're supposed to support each other, is generally considered wrong. Even if the author doesn't directly criticize the weight, being ashamed and using it as a point of contention during arguments can be hurtful. The boyfriend is affected by it and apologizes, which indicates that the author's words are causing him emotional distress. \n\nThe AITA framework usually evaluates whether someone's actions are unkind or judgmental without a valid reason. Here, the author's shame is based on their own comfort around friends rather than any objective issue. The boyfriend's personality and efforts are positive, but the author's behavior could be contributing to his low self-esteem or stress. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is in good shape and the boyfriend is not might be leading to double standards. The author's friends not seeing him is about the author's social anxiety or fear of judgment, which isn't the boyfriend's fault. Using his weight as an argument point is a form of emotional manipulation, even if unintentional. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are likely making the boyfriend feel bad about himself and could be considered wrong. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
