My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, but the author finds him sweet and kind. However, they avoid showing him to friends due to feeling ashamed. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but has been trying to lose it. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nHmm, so first, shaming someone for their weight is a sensitive topic. The author says they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to see him. That's a bit contradictory. They love him and he's making an effort, but the author is still using his weight as a point in arguments. Even if the boyfriend is okay with it, the fact that the author is bringing it up during fights and causing him to apologize suggests that it's affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nAlso, the author mentions avoiding friends seeing the boyfriend because of shame. That's a clear sign of embarrassment, which isn't healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight are commendable, but the author's behavior might be undermining his confidence. \n\nEven if the author isn't overtly mean, the fact that they feel ashamed and use the weight as an argument point is problematic. It's not just about the weight itself but how the author is handling it. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and support. If the author is making the boyfriend feel like his weight is a problem that needs to be fixed to meet the author's social standards, that's a form of emotional pressure.\n\nMoreover, the boyfriend is trying to change his habits on his own schedule, and the author is criticizing the progress. That could indicate a lack of understanding or support. The author's actions might be contributing to the boyfriend's stress rather than helping him feel supported. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have malicious intent, the behavior is still harmful. The key points are the shame expressed, using weight as an argument, and the negative impact on the boyfriend. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
