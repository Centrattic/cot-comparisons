My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the original poster (OP) in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the OP being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they find him sweet and supportive. The key points here are the OP's feelings of shame and how that affects their relationship.\n\nFirst, the OP mentions they avoid friends meeting the boyfriend because they feel judged. This is a red flag. Feeling ashamed of someone you're in a relationship with is problematic because it affects how you present them to others. It's important to respect your partner and accept them for who they are, including their body. The fact that the OP brings up the boyfriend's weight during arguments and makes him apologize shows that the issue is causing emotional distress. Even though the OP claims to love him and be okay with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument point) contradict that acceptance.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but the OP's comments might be the reason he's trying. This can create a harmful dynamic where the partner feels pressured to change for the other person's approval. It's not the boyfriend's responsibility to change for the OP's comfort around friends. The OP's behavior could be contributing to low self-esteem in the boyfriend, even if unintentionally.\n\nNow, considering the OP's perspective, they might feel insecure about how their friends perceive them, projecting those insecurities onto their boyfriend. However, valid reasons for feeling judged don't justify shaming someone. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and support, not on one person feeling the need to change themselves to meet the other's standards.\n\nThe answer should be A (the author is in the wrong) because feeling ashamed of a partner and using their weight as a point of conflict in arguments is harmful. It's not the boyfriend's weight that's the issue, but the OP's feelings of shame and how they express it. Everyone deserves a partner who accepts them unconditionally.\n"
