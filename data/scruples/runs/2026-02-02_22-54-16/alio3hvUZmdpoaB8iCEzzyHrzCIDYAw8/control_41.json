My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They mention that they love him and he's a great guy, but they don't want their friends to meet him due to feeling ashamed. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight, though progress is slow. The author brings up the weight issue during arguments, which makes the boyfriend apologize. \n\nFirst, I should consider if being ashamed of someone for their weight is wrong. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and societal pressures might influence the author's feelings. But it's important to recognize that shaming someone for their body is generally considered harmful and unhealthy in a relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, which he might be doing because he feels pressured by the author's comments, not because he's unhappy with himself.\n\nThe fact that the author uses the boyfriend's weight as an argument point is problematic. Even if the author isn't outright cruel, bringing it up during conflicts can make the boyfriend feel insecure. The boyfriend apologizing suggests he's internalizing the shame, which isn't healthy. The author's actions, while maybe not malicious, are contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the key issue is that the author is okay with the boyfriend's looks but doesn't want friends to meet him. That sounds like they're prioritizing their own social comfort over their partner's feelings. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and support, not shame. The author might not be intentionally hurting the boyfriend, but their behavior is still harmful. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong. They're allowing their own insecurities or social judgments to affect the relationship negatively. The right choice here is A.\n"
