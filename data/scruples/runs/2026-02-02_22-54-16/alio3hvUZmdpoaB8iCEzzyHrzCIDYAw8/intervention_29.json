My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and they've been together over a year. The boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to improve, but the author avoids friends meeting him due to shame. They also bring up weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits they feel ashamed, which is a personal feeling. However, using that shame to avoid social interactions and bringing it up during arguments can be harmful. Even if the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the author's behavior might be making him feel insecure. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow, and the author's comments during arguments could be undermining his efforts or self-esteem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. While it's natural to have personal insecurities, acting on them in a way that affects the partner's self-worth is problematic. The fact that the author brings up weight during arguments and causes the boyfriend to apologize suggests that the author's behavior is contributing to his distress. Even if the author loves him, the shame and the way they handle conflicts might be harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to change could be driven by the author's pressure, which isn't healthy. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making someone feel ashamed. The author's actions, while stemming from their own discomfort, are impacting the boyfriend negatively. So, even if the author isn't malicious, they are in the wrong for not addressing their feelings constructively and for contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
