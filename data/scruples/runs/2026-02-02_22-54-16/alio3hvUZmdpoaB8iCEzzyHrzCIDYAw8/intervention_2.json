My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is in a relationship where the boyfriend is overweight. The author is okay with his looks but feels ashamed when friends might see him. They mention that the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nThe key points here are the feelings of shame and the impact on the boyfriend. The author admits to being ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but using that as a reason to avoid friends meeting him and bringing it up during arguments could be problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts, so the author's reactions might undermine his progress. Also, the boyfriend is affected by these comments, leading to apologies, which suggests that the author's words are hurting him. Even if the author is in a good shape themselves, shaming someone for their weight can be harmful. The fact that the author is okay with his looks but still feels ashamed is contradictory. The main issue here is the emotional impact on the boyfriend and the author's own judgmental attitude, which might be considered wrong even if it's unintentional. So, the answer would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
