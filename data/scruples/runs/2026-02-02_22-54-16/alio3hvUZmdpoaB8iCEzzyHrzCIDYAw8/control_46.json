My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and making it a point of argument when they fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits, like being sweet and considerate. However, they feel ashamed of his weight to the point of avoiding friends meeting him. They mentioned that the boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to improve his diet and exercise. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him emotionally as he apologizes instantly.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Feeling ashamed of someone else's appearance isn't uncommon, but acting on it can be problematic. The author is making their discomfort a point of contention in the relationship. Even if they don't outright criticize his weight, using it as an argument point and causing emotional distress is harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to improve show he's self-aware but perhaps struggling with self-esteem. The author's behavior might undermine his efforts and damage his self-worth.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author avoids friends meeting the boyfriend because of appearance suggests a deeper issue of insecurity or societal judgment. It's important to respect a partner's autonomy and not impose one's own standards as conditions for the relationship. The boyfriend's willingness to apologize when this topic comes up in arguments indicates he feels guilty or unworthy, which is a red flag. Relationships should be supportive, not sources of shame.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional stress by making his weight a point of contention. Even if the author isn't directly rude, using this as an argument topic is unfair and harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
