My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. She's concerned about her friends seeing him because she doesn't want to be judged. Her boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow because of his schedule and habits. When they argue, she uses his weight as a point, and he gets affected, apologizing instantly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is ashamed of her partner, which is a personal feeling, but using it in arguments could be problematic. Even though she says she's okay with his appearance, her actions (avoiding friends, bringing it up during arguments) might hurt him. The boyfriend is trying to make changes, which shows he's responsive to her feelings, but the fact that he apologizes suggests he feels guilty or inadequate, which might not be healthy.\n\nShame and body image are sensitive topics. While it's one thing to have personal preferences, projecting that shame onto a partner and making them feel like they need to change can be harmful. Relationships should be supportive, and if one partner is constantly made to feel like their body is a problem, it can lead to self-esteem issues. The author might not be in the wrong in the sense that she's human and has her own insecurities, but morally, making someone feel ashamed for something they can't easily control might be wrong. The boyfriend's efforts to change are commendable, but the root issue is the author's judgment affecting their relationship dynamics. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because her actions are affecting his self-worth and their relationship negatively, even if her intentions aren't malicious.\n"
