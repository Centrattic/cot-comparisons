My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him, even though she loves him and he's trying to improve. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend's weight, which is making him feel bad because he's apologizing during arguments. She says she's okay with his appearance but doesn't want friends to meet him. He's making efforts to lose weight but progress is slow. The main issue here is the emotional impact on the boyfriend and the author's feelings of shame.\n\nShame is a personal feeling, but when it affects the other person's self-esteem, it becomes a problem. The boyfriend is affected and apologizes, which suggests that the author's comments or avoidance are hurting him. Even if she's not directly mean, her actions (avoiding friends and bringing up weight during arguments) contribute to his self-consciousness. \n\nThe author is in a position where her partner is making efforts to change, possibly to meet her expectations, even though she says she's okay with his appearance. This creates a conflicting dynamic where her actions might undermine his self-worth. It's important to consider that body shaming can be subtle but damaging. Even if she isn't overtly criticizing him, her shame and the resulting behavior are impacting him negatively.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction (apologizing) indicates that he internalizes her comments as his fault, which isn't right. The author should be supportive and address the issue without making him feel he needs to apologize for his body. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and support, not shame-based dynamics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author loves her boyfriend, her feelings of shame and the way they manifest are harmful. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
