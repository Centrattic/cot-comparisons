My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The person is a girl who's been with her boyfriend for over a year. They mention that he's sweet and always prioritizes her well-being. She's in good shape, but he's overweight. She says she's fine with how he looks, but she's ashamed of him and avoids her friends seeing him. She's even brought up the issue with him, and he's trying to lose weight but it's slow. When they argue, she brings it up, and he gets affected, apologizing. She loves him and thinks he's the nicest guy she's met, but she's still ashamed.\n\nHmm. So the question is, is she in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues in relationships. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend's weight, even though she claims to be fine with it. There's a difference between being okay with someone's appearance in private versus feeling ashamed in social situations. That could be problematic because it's about how she feels about herself in relation to him, not necessarily his worth. \n\nThe boyfriend is trying to lose weight, which shows he's aware of her concerns. But the fact that she uses it as an argument point during fights is probably not healthy. Even if he's okay with his weight, bringing it up during arguments can hurt him, especially if he's already trying to make changes. \n\nAlso, the fact that she avoids introducing him to her friends because of his weight is a red flag. That's a sign that she's prioritizing her social comfort over his feelings and their relationship. It's one thing to feel self-conscious, but it's another to let that self-consciousness affect how she treats her partner. \n\nEven though she loves him and he's a great partner, her actions (using his weight as a point in arguments, avoiding friends, making him apologize for his appearance) might be contributing to his self-esteem issues. It's possible she's projecting her own insecurities onto the situation. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making the other feel ashamed. If she's fine with his weight in private but not in public, that's a conflict between her personal feelings and social anxiety. But bringing it up during arguments is definitely a problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though she loves him, her behavior is problematic. She's making her boyfriend feel ashamed, which is not right. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she's allowing her own insecurities to affect their relationship negatively.\n"
