My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. So the scenario is that she's in a relationship with a guy who's overweight but sweet and kind. She's okay with his weight herself but doesn't want friends to see him because she's ashamed. She's discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight, but it's slow. When they argue, she brings it up, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. She's ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but using that shame to pressure him or make him feel bad might be the issue. Even though he's okay with his weight, her bringing it up during arguments could be hurting him. The fact that he's making efforts but not seeing progress means she might be adding stress. Also, not wanting friends to meet him because of his appearance could be a sign of insecurity or societal pressure affecting their relationship.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider if the author's actions are harmful. The boyfriend is affected emotionally when she brings up his weight during arguments, which suggests it's not a neutral issue. Even if she's not directly mean, the shame she feels and projecting it onto him could be damaging. Relationships should be supportive, and making someone feel ashamed about their body isn't healthy. The fact that she's hiding him from friends for appearance might indicate deeper issues, like self-consciousness or not fully accepting him as he is. \n\nSo, even though her intentions might be to help him, the way she's handling it\u2014especially during arguments\u2014is likely contributing to his emotional distress. The key here is the impact of her behavior on him. She loves him and he's kind, but her actions are causing him to apologize and feel bad, which isn't right. The author is in the wrong because she's allowing her personal shame to negatively affect her partner's self-esteem and their relationship dynamics. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
