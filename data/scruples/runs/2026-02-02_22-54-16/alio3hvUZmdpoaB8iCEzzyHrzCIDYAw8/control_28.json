My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is sweet and caring, always prioritizing her needs. That's a positive aspect of their relationship. However, the issue is her feeling ashamed of his appearance, leading her to avoid introducing him to friends. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him emotionally. \n\nNow, weight is a sensitive topic. Even if someone isn't directly bullying or being mean, feeling ashamed and using it as a point in arguments can be hurtful. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but struggling with his schedule and habits. The fact that he's affected by her comments and apologizes shows that it's impacting him negatively. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harmful. Avoiding friends meeting him because of his weight implies she feels embarrassed, which isn't fair to him. Also, bringing up his weight during arguments isn't healthy conflict resolution. It shifts the blame onto him rather than addressing the actual issues in the relationship. \n\nEven though she says she's okay with his appearance, her actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument point) don't align with that. It's possible she has internalized societal standards about body image, which are leading her to feel this way. However, projecting her shame onto him and making him feel like he needs to change for her is definitely unfair. \n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's approach might be putting pressure on him and contributing to his stress. Healthy relationships involve support, not making the other person feel inadequate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because her behavior is harmful and lacks support for her boyfriend. She needs to address her feelings of shame and find healthier ways to handle conflicts without targeting his body.\n"
