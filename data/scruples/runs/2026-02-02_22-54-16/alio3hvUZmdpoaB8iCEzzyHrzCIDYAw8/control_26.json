My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that they've been together over a year, the boyfriend is sweet and makes efforts to improve, but the author feels ashamed and avoids showing him to friends. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but tries to lose it when the author brings it up. The author sometimes uses his weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if being ashamed is wrong. The key here is that the author is ashamed not because their boyfriend is unhealthy, but because of societal judgment from friends. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's comments during arguments are hurting him. Even though the author says they're okay with his appearance, the shame affects their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend is affected emotionally when the author brings up his weight during arguments. That's a red flag. It's one thing to have personal feelings but using someone's appearance as a point of argument is hurtful. The author's shame is leading to emotional harm, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is trying to make changes, but the pressure from the author might be unhealthy. It's possible the author is enabling their own insecurity by focusing on his weight rather than supporting him. The fact that the author avoids friends meeting him because of shame shows a lack of acceptance, even if it's not intentional.\n\nIn relationships, acceptance is important. Being ashamed of a partner's body, even if they're making efforts, can damage self-esteem. The author's behavior is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're causing emotional harm through their actions and comments, even if their intentions are to help.\n"
