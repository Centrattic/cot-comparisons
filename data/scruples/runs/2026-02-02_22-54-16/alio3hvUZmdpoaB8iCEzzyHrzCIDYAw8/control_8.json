My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine.

Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's boyfriend is sweet and prioritizes their well-being. The author is okay with his looks but feels ashamed when friends see him. They've discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him, and he apologizes.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Feeling ashamed of someone else because of their appearance can be problematic. It's one thing to have personal feelings, but acting on them in a way that affects the person's self-esteem is another. The boyfriend is already making efforts to change, but the author is using his weight as an argument point. That could be considered cruel or unfair, even if the author isn't directly bullying him. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is okay with his appearance, which suggests he has self-acceptance. The author's shame might be projecting their own insecurities or societal pressures onto him. The fact that the boyfriend feels the need to apologize after being criticized by his partner indicates that the author's behavior is hurting him emotionally. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. If the author truly loves him, they should be encouraging and not making him feel ashamed. Even if the author is trying to help by discussing weight, doing so in the context of arguments isn't healthy. It's possible that the author needs to address their own feelings of shame rather than letting it affect their partner. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are contributing to their boyfriend's emotional distress. Even if they have good intentions, the way they're handling the situation is harmful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
