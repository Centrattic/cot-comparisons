My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends, even though the boyfriend is trying to lose weight. They also mention bringing up the issue during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a relationship where they're happy with the boyfriend's personality but uncomfortable with his appearance. They don't want friends to meet him because of shame. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but progress is slow. The author brings up the issue during arguments, making the boyfriend apologize.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Feeling ashamed of someone's appearance is a personal feeling, but it's important how that affects the relationship. The boyfriend is okay with his weight, but the author's comments are making him feel bad. The author loves him but is causing emotional harm. Making someone feel ashamed and using their body as an argument point isn't healthy. Even if the author isn't the cause of the weight, they're contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. The boyfriend's efforts to change might be driven by the author's criticism, which isn't positive motivation. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and not making someone feel inadequate. So, the author is likely in the wrong for causing emotional harm and not supporting the boyfriend unconditionally. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
