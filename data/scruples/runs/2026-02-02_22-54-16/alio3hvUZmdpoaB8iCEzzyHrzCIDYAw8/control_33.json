My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and causing him to apologize during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is okay with their boyfriend's appearance but doesn't want friends to see him. They've mentioned this to him multiple times, and he's trying to lose weight. However, when they argue, the author brings up his weight, which affects him, leading him to apologize. The author loves him and says he's a good person, but the shame is directed towards others' perceptions.\n\nNow, considering relationships and ethics. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight is a form of body shaming. Even if it's not expressed directly to others, the fact that the author brings it up during arguments and it's causing emotional distress to the boyfriend is problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but it's his own choice, and the author is using his appearance as a point of conflict. This can erode self-esteem and create a toxic dynamic. In healthy relationships, partners support each other without making the other feel bad for things they can't control easily, like weight. So, the author is contributing to the problem by using the boyfriend's weight as a point of contention in arguments, even if they themselves are fine with it. The shame is internal but the actions are affecting the other person negatively. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
