My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're in a relationship with their boyfriend, who's overweight but sweet and does a lot for them. The author is okay with his weight but feels ashamed to introduce him to their friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress, and during arguments, the author brings up his weight, which affects him.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame and how they're handling it. They admit they're ashamed, which is a personal feeling, but the problem comes when they use the boyfriend's weight as an argument point. Even though they say they're okay with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends and bringing up weight in arguments) suggest otherwise. Using someone's body or weight as a way to argue isn't healthy. It can make the partner feel insecure, even if the author says they're fine with it. The boyfriend is trying to make changes, but the author's behavior might be contributing to his stress. Also, the shame aspect\u2014feeling ashamed of their partner for their body isn't fair, as it's not something they can easily change. Relationships should be supportive, and making someone feel bad about their body, even if it's not intentional, is problematic. So, the author is in the wrong because their actions are affecting the boyfriend negatively and using his weight as a point of contention during arguments. They need to address their own insecurities without making the partner feel bad.\n"
