My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that she's ashamed of her boyfriend because he's fat. She says he's sweet and prioritizes her, but she avoids her friends meeting him because she doesn't want to be judged. She also mentions that when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she is in the wrong. The key points here are about shame and how she's handling his weight. Being ashamed of someone for their appearance is generally considered negative. Even though she loves him and he's okay with his weight, her actions\u2014avoiding friends and using his weight as an argument point\u2014are problematic.\n\nShe brings up his weight during arguments, which can be hurtful. Even if she's not directly criticizing him, making it a point of contention can damage self-esteem. Also, avoiding friends meeting him because of shame isn't healthy for the relationship. It shows lack of support and could lead to insecurity in him.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but she's not supportive in a constructive way. Instead of encouraging him without making him feel bad, she's using it as a point of contention. That's not healthy. Even if she's fine with his appearance, her shame and using it as a criticism point during arguments is where she's wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, yes, she's in the wrong. Because she's allowing her insecurities to affect the relationship negatively and not supporting him properly.\n"
