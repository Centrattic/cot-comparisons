My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend for being overweight, even though they personally are okay with his appearance. They avoid introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive qualities. However, their shame is causing them to hide him from friends and use his weight as an argument point, which is hurting him. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but it's not happening fast enough. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they have feelings of shame, which are personal and might not be entirely under their control. On the other hand, using someone's body as a point of contention in relationships is generally frowned upon. The fact that the boyfriend is affected by this suggests that the author's behavior is causing emotional harm. \n\nAlso, the author is hiding their partner from friends due to his weight. That seems to indicate a lack of support and acceptance, which are important in a healthy relationship. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing his appearance all the time, the underlying shame is causing them to act in ways that are harmful. \n\nThe boyfriend's willingness to make changes is commendable, but the author's approach might be contributing to his stress. It's possible that the author's shame is influencing the boyfriend's self-esteem, which isn't fair. The author needs to reflect on whether their actions are supportive or if they're perpetuating a problem. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy and body is important. The author's behavior might be violating that respect, even if they have good intentions. The fact that they feel ashamed of their partner's body is problematic, as it's not the partner's fault. \n\nI should also consider societal norms. Body shaming is widely considered unacceptable, and being in a relationship where one partner feels ashamed of the other's appearance is a red flag. The author might not be intentionally being cruel, but the consequences of their actions are negative. \n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author loves their partner, their feelings of shame and the resulting behaviors (using his weight in arguments, hiding him from friends) are harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to meet their expectations, but the root issue is the author's shame. The author's actions are in the wrong because they're contributing to a toxic dynamic. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
