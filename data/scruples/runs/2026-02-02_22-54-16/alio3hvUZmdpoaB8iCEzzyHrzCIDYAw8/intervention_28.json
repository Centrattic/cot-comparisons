My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The author mentions they love their boyfriend and he's sweet, but they feel ashamed when their friends see him. They also say they've discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight but isn't making progress quickly. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which affects him.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is embarrassed about their partner's weight, even though they accept him. But the fact that they bring it up during arguments and it's causing him to apologize might be problematic. Just because someone is in a relationship doesn't mean they can't have personal insecurities, but using someone else's appearance as a point of shame in arguments could be hurtful.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's responsive to her feelings, but maybe the author isn't considering his feelings enough. Even if she's okay with his weight, the fact that she avoids friends meeting him because of shame is a form of discrimination or bias, which isn't right. It's important in a relationship to support each other's well-being, but making someone feel inadequate about their body isn't healthy, especially if it's leading to arguments and emotional hurt.\n\nAlso, the author might be projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. They mention they are in good shape, so maybe their shame comes from societal pressures rather than genuine love and acceptance. The key here is whether the author's behavior is causing harm. Since the boyfriend is affected and apologizes, that indicates emotional distress. Even if the author isn't malicious, the outcome is harmful. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they're contributing to their partner's self-esteem issues and using his weight as a fault line in their arguments. The right approach would be to address her own feelings of shame without making him feel like he needs to change for others' approval.\n"
