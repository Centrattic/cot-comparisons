My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. They mentioned that the boyfriend is overweight, and the author feels ashamed to introduce him to friends, even though they love him and he's sweet. The author also brings up the boyfriend's weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is in a relationship where they have feelings of shame about their partner's weight. While they say they are fine with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends meeting him) suggest otherwise. Also, using his weight as an argument point, even if he's trying to lose weight, might be harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts but struggling due to his schedule and habits. The author's comments lead to him apologizing, which indicates that it's hurting him emotionally.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The author's shame and bringing up the weight issue during arguments could be seen as contributing to the boyfriend's insecurity, even if unintentionally. The boyfriend's efforts to improve might be undermined by the author's negative focus on his weight. The author's own feelings of shame might stem from personal insecurities or societal pressures, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. The key point is whether the author is wrong in feeling this way and acting on it. While the author might not be malicious, the impact on the boyfriend's feelings is significant. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes shows that the author's actions are causing him distress. Even if the author loves him, the way they handle this issue is problematic. So, the answer would be A because the author's behavior is inconsiderate and harmful, even if they have good intentions otherwise.\n"
