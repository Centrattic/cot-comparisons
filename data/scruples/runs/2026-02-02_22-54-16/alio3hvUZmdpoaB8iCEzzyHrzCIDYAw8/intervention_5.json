My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and the author avoids friends meeting him to avoid judgment. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but tries to lose weight when the author brings it up. They argue about it, and the boyfriend apologizes. The author loves him and says they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to see him.\n\nHmm, first, the key issue here is the author's shame. Being ashamed of someone for their weight is a problem because it's about personal judgment and societal standards. Even if the author says they're fine with him, their actions (avoiding friends) show internalized shame. That can be harmful to the relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which might be due to the author's comments, which could be pressuring him unnecessarily. Also, using his weight as an argument point and making him apologize is not healthy. The author's behavior might be contributing to his self-esteem issues. So, even if the author doesn't mean to harm, the impact is there. The right answer here is that the author is in the wrong because they're allowing their own insecurities or societal pressures to affect their partner negatively. So Answer A.\n"
