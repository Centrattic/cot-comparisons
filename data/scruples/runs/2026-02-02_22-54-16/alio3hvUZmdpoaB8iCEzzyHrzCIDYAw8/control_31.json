My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The main issue is that the author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids having friends meet him, even though she says she's okay with his appearance. She also uses his weight as a point in arguments, which upsets him despite his efforts to change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional impact. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health, which shows he cares. However, the author's shame is causing him emotional distress. Even if she doesn't outwardly hate his appearance, her actions (avoiding friends and bringing it up during arguments) are harmful. It's about how her feelings are affecting their relationship dynamics.\n\nNext, the concept of shame and how it's projected. Feeling ashamed of someone else's appearance can be a form of internalized stigma or societal pressure. The author might be projecting her own insecurities onto the relationship, which isn't fair to her boyfriend. The fact that he's okay with his own appearance adds another layer\u2014her shame isn't aligned with his self-image, which could lead to him questioning his worth.\n\nAlso, using his weight as an argument point is problematic. Arguments should address actual issues, not be about pressuring someone to change their body. This could erode trust and make him feel like he's not good enough, which is a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nThe author's justification is that she doesn't want to be judged by her friends. But that's an external factor that shouldn't influence her feelings toward her partner. It's important to recognize that relationships should be built on mutual respect and acceptance, not on hiding one's partner due to fear of others' opinions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is creating a situation where her boyfriend feels he needs to change for her approval rather than for himself. This could lead to unsustainable efforts and self-esteem issues for him. The key here is whether the shame is being expressed in a way that's respectful and supportive. Since it's causing him to apologize and feel affected, it's clear that her actions are contributing to his emotional state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because her feelings of shame are negatively impacting her boyfriend and their relationship. Even if her intentions aren't malicious, the consequences are harmful. The answer should be A.\n"
