My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. The author mentions that they love him and he's sweet, but they avoid their friends meeting him due to feeling judged. They also admit to using his weight as an argument point, which affects him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is making their partner feel ashamed about something that doesn't impact his health or their relationship directly. Even though the boyfriend is okay with his weight, the author's behavior is causing him emotional distress. Using someone's appearance as a point of contention in arguments is problematic because it undermines their self-esteem.\n\nThe author's justification is that they don't want friends to judge them, but that's a projection of their own insecurities onto the situation. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author's focus on his weight might be contributing to his stress. It's important to recognize that body shaming, even in a relationship, is harmful. The fact that the author brings up his weight during arguments suggests that this is a recurring issue that affects their emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they are fine with how he looks, but their actions (avoiding friends and using it in arguments) contradict that. This inconsistency shows a lack of respect for their partner's feelings. The boyfriend's apology after arguments indicates that he feels guilty, which the author might be perpetuating without realizing it. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other without conditional acceptance. The author's behavior could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation, using their partner's insecurities as leverage. Even if the intent isn't malicious, the impact is negative. The answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're causing emotional harm under the guise of love. The key points here are the emotional impact and the lack of respect for the partner's feelings despite outward support.\n"
