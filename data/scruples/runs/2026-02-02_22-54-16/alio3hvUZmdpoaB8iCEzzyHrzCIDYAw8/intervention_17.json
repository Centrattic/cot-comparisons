My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that she's ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and avoids showing him to her friends, even though she's okay with his appearance. She mentions that he's trying to lose weight but making slow progress, and when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend for being overweight. Even though she loves him and he's a good person, she's letting her shame influence their relationship. She's making him feel bad by bringing up his weight during arguments, even though he's trying to improve. The boyfriend is affected by her comments and apologizes, which suggests that her words are hurting him.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, making someone feel ashamed about their body is generally considered harmful. Body image issues are sensitive, and using someone's weight as a point of shame can lead to self-esteem issues and unhealthy behaviors. Even if she's not overtly cruel, the fact that she's avoiding her friends meeting him because of his weight indicates a lack of self-acceptance and possibly projecting her insecurities onto him.\n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's trying to meet her expectations, but the issue here is that the author is using his appearance as a problem to be fixed rather than accepting him as he is. The fact that she brings it up during arguments turns it into a recurring issue that he has to apologize for, which isn't healthy for the relationship.\n\nEven if she's in a good shape herself, that doesn't justify her feelings of shame towards her partner. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and support, not on making one person feel inadequate. The author's behavior could be seen as contributing to his body image struggles, even if she isn't overtly mean about it. The key point is that she's allowing her own insecurities to affect how she treats her partner, which is a sign of being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
