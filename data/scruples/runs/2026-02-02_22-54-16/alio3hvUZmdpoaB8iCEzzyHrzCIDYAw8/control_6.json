My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with someone who they consider sweet and kind. The boyfriend is making efforts to improve his health and lose weight, even though it's slow. The author feels ashamed to show him to friends but tells him, which causes arguments. The boyfriend is affected by this and apologizes. The author loves him but still feels ashamed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings of shame, how it's affecting the relationship, and the boyfriend's efforts. Being ashamed of someone for their body size can be problematic because it's a form of body shaming. Body shaming can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, or other mental health issues. The boyfriend is already making efforts, which shows he cares, but the author's comments are hurting him. Even if the author is being honest, it's not constructive if it's causing emotional distress. \n\nHowever, the author does mention that they love him and find him nice. But the act of being ashamed and using it as an argument point is where the problem lies. It's important to consider if the author is being supportive or if their behavior is harmful. The boyfriend's reaction (instantly apologizing) suggests that the comments are making him feel bad about himself, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't intentionally being cruel, the impact of their words matters. The boyfriend's efforts to improve should be encouraged without making him feel like he's not good enough. The author is in the wrong because they are contributing to the boyfriend's emotional pain through their behavior, even if their intentions aren't malicious. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
