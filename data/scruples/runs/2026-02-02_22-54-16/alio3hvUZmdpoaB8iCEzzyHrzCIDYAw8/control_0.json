My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they love their boyfriend and he's sweet and considerate. But they feel ashamed when friends see him, even though they're okay with his appearance themselves. The boyfriend is making an effort to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author occasionally brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the shame and the impact on the boyfriend. Being ashamed of someone for their body can be harmful. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing him, the fact that they hide him from friends suggests underlying insecurity or societal pressure. Also, using his weight as an argument point and making him apologize might be emotionally manipulative. The boyfriend's efforts are commendable, but the author's behavior could undermine his confidence.\n\nIt's important to consider the emotional effects. If the boyfriend is affected and apologizes, that shows he's hurt by her comments. Even if the author isn't overtly cruel, their actions contribute to his emotional distress. The fact that she's ashamed might stem from her own issues with societal standards rather than her boyfriend's actual behavior. \n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's well-being. However, the author's shame is more about their own comfort around friends than the boyfriend's health. The boyfriend making efforts is good, but the author shouldn't make him feel bad about his body. Body image issues can be sensitive, and the author's behavior could be seen as contributing to a negative environment for the boyfriend.\n\nSo, even though the author likes the boyfriend's personality, the shame and using weight in arguments are problematic. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're projecting their own insecurities onto the relationship and affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
