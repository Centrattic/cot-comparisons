My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The author explains that they're okay with the boyfriend's looks but avoid friends meeting him because of shame. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but it's slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a committed relationship, mentions their boyfriend is sweet and prioritizes their well-being. The issue is about the author's shame leading them to hide the boyfriend from friends. The boyfriend is aware and is trying to make changes, but the author's comments affect him emotionally, making him apologize during arguments.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being ashamed of someone for their body is a form of discrimination, which is generally seen as wrong. It's important to recognize that body shaming, even if unintended, can harm the other person's self-esteem. The author's actions, while not physically harmful, involve emotional impact. The boyfriend's efforts to change could indicate that the author's comments are influencing him, which might not be healthy if it's driven by the author's shame rather than the boyfriend's own desire to change.\n\nAlso, relationships should ideally be built on mutual respect and acceptance. The author's discomfort in social settings due to the boyfriend's appearance may suggest a lack of full acceptance. Even if the author isn't outwardly shaming him, their behavior (avoiding friends) and bringing up the weight during arguments is a form of internalized shame that's affecting the relationship negatively.\n\nThe boyfriend's apology after arguments shows that he's taking the author's comments seriously, which might be hurting him. This dynamic can create a cycle where the author feels guilty, leading to more criticism, and the boyfriend feels worse, trying harder to change but not seeing results. The author's justification that they're \"fine with his looks\" but still feel shame might be a contradiction. Feeling ashamed is a personal emotion, but acting on it in a way that harms the partner's self-esteem crosses into being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author's intentions are to help, the effect is harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
