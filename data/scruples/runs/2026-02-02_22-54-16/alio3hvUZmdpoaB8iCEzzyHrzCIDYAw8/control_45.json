My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is asking if it's their fault (AITA) for being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They mention that they've been together over a year, he's sweet, and he's trying to lose weight but it's slow. The main issues are the shame they feel when friends meet him and the fact that during arguments, they bring up his weight, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, being ashamed of someone for their weight seems like a negative thing. It's not about his behavior but his appearance. The boyfriend is okay with himself, which is a good sign, but the author's shame is causing tension. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author is using his weight as a point of contention during arguments. That's probably not healthy. Even if the author is fine with his looks, the fact that they hide him from friends suggests deeper insecurity or societal judgment. The boyfriend's apology when this comes up indicates that he's hurt by it. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other. If the author is causing emotional distress by bringing up weight issues, even if it's not intentional, it's a problem. The boyfriend's slow progress might be due to his schedule and habits, which are valid challenges, but the author's reaction might be exacerbating the situation. The key here is whether the author is making the boyfriend feel bad about himself, which they are. So even if the author isn't mean-spirited, the behavior is harmful. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
