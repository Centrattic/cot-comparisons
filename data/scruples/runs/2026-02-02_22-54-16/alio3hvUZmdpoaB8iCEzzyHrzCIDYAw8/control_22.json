My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is okay with his appearance, but doesn't want friends to see them. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow, and during arguments, the author brings it up, making him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author loves their boyfriend and says they're fine with his looks, but still feel ashamed. The boyfriend is trying to change, which shows he's aware of the issue. The author is bringing up his weight during arguments, which is probably hurtful even if they mean well. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's behavior towards the boyfriend. Even if the author isn't directly making fun of him, using his weight as a point of contention during arguments is not healthy. The boyfriend is affected, which indicates that it's causing emotional harm. The author's shame about their partner's appearance leading to this dynamic might be problematic. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that the boyfriend is making an effort, but the author's behavior might not be the right way to approach it. The fact that the author avoids friends seeing them because of shame suggests an underlying insecurity or societal pressure. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other without making the other feel ashamed. The author's actions, even if unintentional, are contributing to the boyfriend's insecurities. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're using the boyfriend's weight as a negative point during conflicts, which is harmful and not respectful.\n"
