My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, and the author avoids introducing him to friends because they feel judged. The boyfriend is okay with his weight, trying to lose it, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight during arguments, which makes the boyfriend apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if being ashamed of someone's weight is wrong. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and body image issues are common. However, the key points here are that the author is making the boyfriend feel ashamed and affecting his self-esteem. Even if the author loves him, using his weight as an argument point can be harmful. The boyfriend is already trying to make changes, so the author's comments might be contributing to his stress and affecting his efforts. It's also about respect and how one treats their partner. Even if the author is not outwardly negative, the internal shame and the way it's handled in arguments can be damaging. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're allowing their insecurities to affect their partner's self-worth, even if unintentionally. But maybe there's a nuance where the author isn't directly bullying, just having personal feelings. However, the impact is there. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
