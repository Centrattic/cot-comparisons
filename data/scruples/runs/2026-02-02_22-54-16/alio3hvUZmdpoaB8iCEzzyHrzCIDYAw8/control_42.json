Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend she describes as sweet and considerate. She's in good shape, and he's overweight. She's okay with his appearance but avoids friends meeting him because she's ashamed. She's discussed this with him, and he's trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. She sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, and he gets affected, apologizing instantly. She loves him and acknowledges he's a nice guy.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her feelings of shame and how she's handling it. Being ashamed of someone's appearance isn't unheard of, but it's problematic when it affects their self-esteem and the relationship. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's self-aware and trying to address her concerns. However, using his weight as an argument point and causing him to apologize suggests that her comments are hurtful, even if she's well-meaning. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Even if she's ashamed, it's important to consider how her actions impact her partner. The fact that he's \"affected by it\" and apologizes indicates that her words are causing him distress. This could be a form of emotional manipulation or pressure, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAdditionally, avoiding friends meeting him due to shame might make him feel like he's not accepted as he is. While he's making efforts, the root issue is her discomfort, which she needs to address. The boyfriend's efforts are commendable, but the responsibility lies with the author to not let her insecurities harm him.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other without shame or pressure. Her actions, though perhaps not malicious, are harmful. So, the answer would be that she's in the wrong (A) because her behavior is negatively affecting her partner's well-being and self-esteem.\n"
