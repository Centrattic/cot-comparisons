My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight. They mention that they love him and he's a great guy, but they don't want their friends to meet him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. Also, the author brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is feeling ashamed, which is a personal issue, but how that affects the relationship. The boyfriend is trying to address his weight, but the author is using it as a point in arguments. That seems unfair because it's not just about his weight but about the author's feelings towards it. Even though the author says they're okay with his looks, the shame comes from their own insecurities or fear of judgment from friends. \n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's responsive to her feelings. But the author is making it a point of contention during arguments, which could be harmful. The key here is whether the author is making the boyfriend feel bad about himself for the sake of their own social anxiety. That's a problem because it's not about his behavior but about her perception. \n\nAlso, the author's actions are causing emotional distress to the boyfriend. Even if they love him, the act of being ashamed and bringing up his weight during arguments is not healthy. It's important to consider that body image issues can affect relationships negatively. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or societal pressures onto the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the one with the issue here. The boyfriend is doing his best and seems accepting of himself. The author's shame is the problem, not his weight itself. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're using their partner's appearance as a source of shame and conflict, which is not the partner's fault. They need to address their own feelings rather than making the boyfriend feel like he needs to change for them to be accepted.\n"
