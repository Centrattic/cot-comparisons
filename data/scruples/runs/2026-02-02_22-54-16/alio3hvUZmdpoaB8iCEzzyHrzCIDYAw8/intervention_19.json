My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author mentions that her boyfriend is overweight but that she's okay with his appearance. However, she feels ashamed for her friends to see him and avoids introducing him to her friends. She also says that when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him, and he's making efforts to lose weight despite challenges. She loves him and thinks he's a great guy.\n\nThe key points here are her feelings of shame and how she's projecting that onto her boyfriend. Even though she's fine with his appearance in private, the fact that she's ashamed in social situations can be harmful. It's important to consider the emotional impact on her boyfriend. He's making an effort to change, which suggests he might be internalizing her comments. The fact that he apologizes when she brings up the issue during arguments indicates that he's hurt by her comments.\n\nI should think about societal norms and self-esteem. Being ashamed of someone for their body can be a form of judgment, even if it's not overtly expressed as criticism. The boyfriend's well-being is affected because he's trying to meet her expectations, which might stem from her own insecurities or societal pressures about body image.\n\nAlso, in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and supported. If she's avoiding introducing him to friends due to shame, that's a sign that her feelings are affecting their relationship negatively. Even if she loves him, the shame aspect is problematic because it's about her own comfort rather than his self-worth.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's feelings might be in the wrong because she's causing her boyfriend emotional distress and contributing to his efforts to conform to her standards. The right approach would be to address her own feelings of shame and perhaps seek ways to build his confidence instead of making him feel like he needs to change.\n"
