My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is in good shape, and they've been together over a year. The author is okay with his looks but doesn't want friends to meet him due to feeling judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow, and the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's shame is leading them to avoid friends meeting their boyfriend. They also mention that bringing up the weight issue during arguments affects the boyfriend, who apologizes. The boyfriend is trying to improve, which shows he's not resistant. \n\nNow, the ethical angle here is about body shaming and how relationships should be based on mutual respect. Even if the author isn't outwardly cruel, feeling ashamed and using weight as an argument point can be harmful. It's important to recognize that weight is a sensitive issue and can affect someone's self-esteem. The boyfriend's efforts to change might be driven by the author's comments, which could indicate that the author's behavior is contributing to his stress.\n\nThe author defends their actions by saying they love him and he's a good person. But the issue is the emotional impact on the boyfriend. Even if the author isn't overtly critical, their shame and the way they handle conflicts might be toxic. Relationships require supporting each other, not making someone feel inadequate. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes suggests that the author's behavior is hurting him, even if it's not intentional.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because their actions, while perhaps not malicious, are causing emotional distress. The shame they feel and the way they handle arguments are not healthy for the relationship. It's important to address such issues with empathy and support rather than making someone feel ashamed for their body.\n"
