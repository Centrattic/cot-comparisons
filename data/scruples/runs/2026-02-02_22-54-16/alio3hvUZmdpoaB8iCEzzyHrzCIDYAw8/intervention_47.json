My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their overweight boyfriend. The author mentions that they're fine with his looks but don't want friends to meet him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow. The author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his good qualities. They're not outright rejecting him for his weight but feel ashamed in social contexts. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is making efforts. The key issue is the author's shame causing emotional harm, even if unintended.\n\nShaming someone for their body, even if it's not direct, can be harmful. The fact that bringing up weight becomes an argument point suggests that the author's comments are contributing to the boyfriend's distress. Even if the author isn't malicious, the impact is there. The boyfriend's apology after arguments indicates he feels bad about it, which points to the author's role in that.\n\nAlso, the author's discomfort around friends might stem from their own insecurities or societal pressures. However, projecting that shame onto the boyfriend isn't fair. It's important to recognize that body image issues often involve personal insecurities rather than the other person's actual worth.\n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's focus on his weight progress might be putting pressure on him. The slow progress could be due to various factors beyond his control, and the author's reactions might undermine his efforts instead of supporting him.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to foster mutual respect and support. The author's behavior, while perhaps not malicious, is causing emotional strain. It's possible the author hasn't fully realized how their words affect their partner, but the harm is still present. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress through their shaming and conditional acceptance based on appearance.\n"
