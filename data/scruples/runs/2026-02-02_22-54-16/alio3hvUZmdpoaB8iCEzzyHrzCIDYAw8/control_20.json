My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but is struggling. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. That's a problem because it's about feeling embarrassed about someone they love. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight. However, the author is using his weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful even if they don't mean to be. The boyfriend is hurt by this and apologizes, which is a red flag. The author loves him but still feels ashamed, which might be an internal conflict.\n\nShaming someone for their weight can be considered a form of body shaming, which is generally frowned upon. Even if the author is trying to support the boyfriend by bringing it up, doing so during arguments is not constructive. The boyfriend's efforts to lose weight are slow, and the author's shame might be the main issue here. The fact that the author avoids friends meeting him suggests a lack of acceptance, which is part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is affected emotionally, which shows that the author's actions are impacting his self-esteem. Even if the author is trying to help, the way they approach it is harmful. The author should focus on supporting the boyfriend's efforts without making him feel ashamed. So, the answer would lean towards AITA being the author, hence option A.\n"
