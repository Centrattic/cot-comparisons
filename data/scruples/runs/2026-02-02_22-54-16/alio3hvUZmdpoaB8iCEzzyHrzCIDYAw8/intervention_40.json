My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, always prioritizing the author's needs. The author is okay with his looks but avoids introducing him to friends due to feeling ashamed. They've discussed the issue, and the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend negatively.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of shame and the impact on the boyfriend. Even though the author says they're fine with his weight, the shame is causing emotional harm. The boyfriend is trying to improve, but the author's focus on his weight might be contributing to his low self-esteem and the arguments.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making the other feel inadequate. The author's shame could be stemming from their own insecurities or societal pressures. However, projecting that onto their partner can be damaging. The boyfriend's apology after arguments suggests he feels criticized, which isn't healthy. The author's actions, while not malicious, are affecting the boyfriend's emotional well-being. So, even if the intention isn't to hurt, the effect is negative. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress through their behavior.\n"
