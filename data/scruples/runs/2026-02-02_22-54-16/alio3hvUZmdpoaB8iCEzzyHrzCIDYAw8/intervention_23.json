My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. She mentions that he's sweet and makes efforts to lose weight, but she's still embarrassed and avoids showing him to her friends. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what societal norms and values say about body image and relationships. While it's one thing to have personal insecurities, it's another to project those onto a partner. The key here is that she's making him feel ashamed, even if it's unintentional. By bringing up his weight in arguments, she's contributing to his emotional distress. That's a problem because it's not his fault, and it's unfair to make him feel like his worth is tied to his appearance.\n\nShe says she's okay with how he looks but is embarrassed around friends. That contradiction might indicate her own internalized biases or societal pressures. Even if she's not directly bullying him, the fact that she's using his weight as a point in arguments shows that her feelings are affecting their relationship negatively. The boyfriend is already trying to make changes, but the issue is the emotional impact on him.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's well-being without making the other feel bad. Her actions, though not malicious, are harming their dynamic. So, the answer would be A (she's in the wrong) because she's contributing to his insecurity and using his weight as a leverage in arguments, which is not acceptable.\n"
