My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend because he's overweight. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author says she's okay with how he looks but doesn't want her friends to see him because she's ashamed. She mentions he's sweet and makes efforts to lose weight despite his busy schedule. But when they argue, she brings up his weight, which affects him emotionally.\n\nHmm, so even though she loves him and he's trying, the fact that she's avoiding her friends meeting him because of his weight seems problematic. Being ashamed of someone for their body can lead to emotional harm. The boyfriend is already affected when she brings it up during arguments, which might not be healthy for their relationship. \n\nAlso, she's fine with his appearance but the shame is more about her own perception and fear of judgment from friends. That's her issue, but projecting that onto her partner's efforts to change could be manipulative or hurtful. He's making efforts, but if the pressure is coming from her, it's not sustainable or fair. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making someone feel bad about themselves. Even if she's not directly criticizing him all the time, her avoidance and using his weight as an argument point is probably hurting him. So maybe she's in the wrong here because it's her shame affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nI think the answer is A (she is in the wrong) because she's allowing her own feelings of shame to impact her partner's self-esteem and their relationship dynamics, even though she claims to be okay with his appearance.\n"
