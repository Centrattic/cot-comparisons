My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight, even though they love him and he's making efforts to improve.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids friends meeting him. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but is trying to lose weight, though progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, and the boyfriend gets affected, apologizing immediately. The author claims they love him and are fine with his looks but don't want friends to see him.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether it's right to feel ashamed of a partner for their weight, even if they're making efforts. The boyfriend is making an effort, which shows he's not in a bad place, but the author's actions are making him feel that he's a source of shame. That's a problem because it's not his fault to be in a certain body. Even if the author is fine with his appearance, the fact that they're hiding him from friends and using it as a point in arguments suggests that their behavior is harmful.\n\nThe author is in the wrong because their shame is affecting the boyfriend's self-esteem and causing emotional distress. It's important in a relationship to support each other, not to make one partner feel they need to apologize for who they are. The boyfriend's efforts to change are commendable, but the author's judgment is the root cause here. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
