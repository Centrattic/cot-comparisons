      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight, even though they love him and he's a sweet guy. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author is in a relationship for over a year. They accept their boyfriend's weight but feel ashamed when friends see him. They avoid introducing him to friends for fear of judgment. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow due to his schedule. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which affects him and makes him apologize.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame and their impact on the boyfriend. Even though the author says they're okay with his appearance, the fact that they hide him from friends and bring up his weight during arguments is problematic. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's comments are hurting him. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings. Even if the author isn't malicious, making someone feel ashamed about their body, especially when they're already working on it, can be harmful. The boyfriend's feelings are valid; being criticized by someone you love, especially in a conflict, can be really tough. \n\nThe author might not be doing it maliciously, but the effect is there. The boyfriend's apology when the topic comes up shows that he's affected. The author's shyness about friends seeing him also indicates deeper insecurity, maybe about their own relationship or societal judgment. \n\nSo, even if the author loves him and he's nice, the behavior of making him feel ashamed and using his weight as an argument point is wrong. The right approach would be to support him without judgment, perhaps encouraging him gently without making it a point of contention. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
