I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (let's say A) not deleting nude photos of a girl B until she paid back the rent she owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author claims that B signed a release (RATS, probably meaning release and transfer of rights) giving him legal ownership of the photos. If that's true, then legally, he might have the right to keep or delete them as he sees fit, unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. However, even if he legally owns the rights, public policy and ethical standards often discourage using such photos for leverage. In many places, using someone's nudity for blackmail or to gain leverage in a personal dispute could be seen as illegal, even if you have the rights. That's a key point\u2014possession of rights doesn't necessarily mean you can exploit them in a coercive way.\n\nThen there's the personal ethics and relationship angle. B and A were in a romantic relationship and lived together. B didn't pay rent, which is a financial issue. A used the nude photos as a bargaining chip to get the money. This is a form of coercive behavior. Even if B had signed a release, the act of withholding the deletion of photos as a means to collect debt is problematic. It's a personal dispute over money, and using sensitive material to pressure someone is generally considered unethical and could be illegal under blackmail or extortion laws.\n\nThe author also mentions threatening to post B's messages online and suing her for slander if she accused him of abuse. That's another layer of intimidation. Threats can be a legal issue on their own. If he followed through by posting the texts, that could be a violation of privacy for B, even if she consented to the photos. It's possible that B's consent to the photos doesn't extend to having her private messages shared publicly.\n\nMoreover, the fact that B's friend later brought the money suggests that the author's actions were a way to extract payment, which might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. Even though the lease ended and the author moved out, using personal and potentially intimate photos as leverage is crossing a line. People can't be blackmailed with their own images, regardless of legal ownership, because that's a misuse of consent and rights.\n\nIn summary, while the author may have had legal rights to the photos, using them as a tool to demand payment in a personal context is likely inappropriate and could be illegal. The threats and the way he leveraged the photos for rent money point to him being in the wrong ethically and possibly legally.\n"
