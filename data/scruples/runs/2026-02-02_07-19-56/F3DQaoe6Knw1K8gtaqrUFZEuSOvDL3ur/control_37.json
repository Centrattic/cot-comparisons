I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for holding onto nude photos until the ex pays back rent. Let's start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl (B) were in a relationship. They took nude photos, which B paid for, and she signed a release (waiver). They moved in together, but she stopped paying rent and left. The lease ended, and the author kept paying. After a year, B comes back asking for the photos to be deleted. The author refuses unless she pays back the rent she owed. She threatens to report him for abuse, and he responds by threatening to post her texts and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical angles.\n\nLegally, if B signed a release, the author might have rights to the photos. However, using nude photos, even with consent, can be tricky. The author is holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. Rent and photos are separate issues. Using the photos to collect a debt might be unethical or illegal, as it's not a legal claim. The threat to post her messages or sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse could be problematic. Introducing false accusations is serious, but threatening to expose her messages might be a form of revenge, which could be unethical.\n\nEthically, holding someone's nude photos to collect a debt is a form of coercion. Even if they signed a release, the author shouldn't use the photos as a tool to collect money owed. Debt collection should follow legal channels, not involve personal assets or privacy. Also, threatening to expose private communications could be considered harassment or retaliation.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions might cross into blackmail. Using something personal (nudes) to get money is typically not allowed. Even if the lease was over, the rent was owed during the lease period. The author might have a valid claim for the unpaid rent, but using the photos as leverage is not the right approach.\n\nThe fact that B threatened to lie about him being abusive adds to the tension, but responding with threats of your own isn't a legal solution. The author's actions, while possibly justified in his mind, involve using personal information against someone, which is generally unethical.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, blackmail is a crime, and threatening to expose private information unless demands are met can be illegal. Even if the author had the rights to the photos, using them to force payment is not a legal method. The proper way would be to pursue legal action for the unpaid rent, not hold onto the photos as leverage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps born from a sense of injustice, are ethically and possibly legally questionable. He's using personal and sensitive material to settle a debt, which is a form of coercion. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
