I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the person (let's call him A) took nude photos of his girlfriend B when they were dating. B paid him for these photos and signed rights waivers. They moved in together, but B stopped paying rent, leading A to cover the costs. After the lease ended, B asked him to delete the photos. A refused unless she paid back the rent. B then threatened to accuse him of abuse, so he countered by saying he'd post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend got the money, and A deleted the photos.\n\nNow, the key points here. The legal aspect: B signed waivers transferring the rights. Even if she didn't, in some cases, photographers might retain rights. So legally, A might have a standing to keep the photos. But ethically, is it right to hold nude photos for ransom for unpaid rent? Even if the rent was a separate issue, using the photos as leverage feels exploitative. The rent issue is a civil matter between them, but holding private images as a debt collection method is questionable. B's threats of false accusations could be seen as blackmail, but A's response of threatening to expose her messages and sue for slander might be a legal stance. However, the main issue is whether holding onto the photos for financial gain from the other party's debt is morally acceptable. Even if legally permissible, it's ethically dubious. Plus, the photos are sensitive, and pressuring someone to get money by threatening to share them is a form of coercion. So while there may be legal arguments, the author's actions cross into unethical territory by using a personal, intimate matter as leverage for financial compensation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
