I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos, legal rights, and some sort of payment for rent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author and this girl, B, were in a relationship. They took nude photos of her, which she paid for, and she signed waivers giving him the rights. Then they moved in together, but she stopped paying rent, leading him to cover the rent. After the lease ended, he moved out. Two years later, she contacts him demanding the photos be deleted. He refuses unless she pays back the rent, and when she threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to post their messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nThe key points here are about legal ownership, threats, and whether he's using the photos as leverage for payment. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legal ownership. If she signed a waiver transferring rights to him, then he might legally own the photos. So he's not obligated to delete them unless there's a legal requirement. But using those photos as leverage for unpaid rent is another matter. The rent was part of their lease agreement, which is separate from the photography agreement. Even if he has legal rights to the photos, demanding payment for them after the relationship is over might be a different issue.\n\nThen there's the part where he threatens to post her messages if she accuses him of abuse. That could be seen as blackmail or extortion, depending on the jurisdiction. Also, threatening to sue for slander if she makes false accusations might be a legal threat, but if he's just defending himself, maybe it's justified. However, the situation becomes complex when he uses the photos as leverage for the rent that she no longer owes after the lease ended.\n\nAnother angle: the rent was paid during the lease. After the lease, she wasn't required to pay him rent anymore. So maybe he's holding her responsible for rent she wasn't obligated to pay anymore. If he's using that as a reason to withhold deleting the photos, which he legally owns, that could be seen as unethical or even illegal if he's making a business out of it.\n\nAlso, threatening to post private messages could be a violation of her privacy, even if she sent them. Plus, the fact that he kept the photos for two years and used them as leverage might not be the right approach. Even with legal rights, the way he's handling it could be problematic.\n\nIn some places, using threats to get money might be considered blackmail. If he's saying he'll delete the photos only if she pays, and she's not under any legal obligation to pay, that could be a problem. Also, threatening to expose her messages if she accuses him of abuse might be seen as intimidation.\n\nSo, even though he might have legal ownership of the photos, the way he's using them to collect unpaid rent from a past relationship, especially after the lease is over, might be wrong. Plus, the threats involved could be crossing legal boundaries. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
