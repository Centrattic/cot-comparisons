I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a photography relationship where nudes were taken, rights were signed over, and then a financial dispute led to the author holding onto the photos until payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions that the girl signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then he might have a right to the photos. But taking nude photos can be complicated, especially if there's a power dynamic involved, like in a relationship. Even if she signed a waiver, there's the question of consent and whether it was given freely, especially if they were in a dating relationship. Some jurisdictions have specific laws about nudes and consent, so maybe the waiver isn't enough.\n\nThen there's the financial dispute. The author is holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. That's a problem because using someone's personal information or images to collect debt is usually not allowed. Even if he owns the photos, threatening to release them unless payment is made could be considered blackmail or extortion. Legally, you can't use someone's private images as a way to collect money.\n\nThe author also mentions that he would post the texts and sue for slander if she accused him of abuse. That sounds like a threat, which is not advisable. Intimidation tactics, even if backed by some legal right, can lead to legal issues. Also, if the girl had a valid claim of abuse, his response could be seen as defamatory or as an attempt to retaliate.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical side. Even if legally he might have some standing, from a moral standpoint, using personal images as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent is questionable. It's exploiting a past relationship for financial gain, which most people would find unethical, regardless of the legalities.\n\nThe situation also involves the girl allegedly lying about manipulation and abuse. While the author provided evidence of her consent, if she made false accusations, that's a separate issue. However, his response to her potential accusations by threatening to post messages might not be the best approach. Legal action for slander is possible if the accusations are false, but threatening to retaliate can escalate the conflict and lead to more issues.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have legal rights over the photos due to the waiver, using them as leverage for unpaid rent and making threats likely crosses into abusive or illegal territory. The financial dispute should be handled through proper channels, not by holding personal images hostage. Ethically and legally, the author's actions are problematic, especially the threat aspect and using nudes as a form of payment collection.\n"
