I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not deleting nude photos of an ex-girlfriend until she paid back rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author says she signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"releases\" or \"waivers\") giving him rights to the photos. Even if that's true, nude photos can be sensitive. But the main issue here isn't just legal ownership. The author used her payment and the lease situation as leverage to delete the photos. He's holding her debt over her head, which is a bit of a power play.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The ex didn't pay rent, but the author kept paying to avoid eviction. Now he's using that unpaid rent as a way to get money back, but in exchange for deleting the photos. Even if he legally owns the photos, using emotional or financial leverage to extract payment could be seen as unethical. It's like blackmail, even if it's framed as a legal right.\n\nAlso, the ex threatened to accuse him of abuse, which he responds to by threatening to post her messages. That's escalating the conflict, and threatening legal action (slander) might be overreaching. The resolution where her friend gives the money and he deletes the photos seems to validate that the author's approach worked, but does that make it right?\n\nLegally, he might have a point if the waiver is valid. But morally, holding someone's personal images hostage for unpaid rent is a gray area. People might see it as exploiting a personal relationship for financial gain. Even if the photos are legal, the coercion involved could make him the wronged party in the eyes of others. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he used the photos as leverage in a manipulative way beyond just legal ownership.\n"
