I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not deleting the nude photos until the ex-girlfriend paid back the rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the author mentions that the girl signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"release\" or \"model releases\"). Model releases typically transfer the rights to the photographer, so legally, the author might own the photos. However, even with a release, the use of nude photos can be a gray area, especially if they involve someone you were in a relationship with. But the key here is that the author is holding the photos as a form of payment for unpaid rent. \n\nThe ex-girlfriend didn't pay rent, and the author is now using the photos as leverage to get the money back. That's where it gets tricky. Legally, can you hold someone's personal data as ransom? In many jurisdictions, that could be considered illegal. It's similar to extortion or blackmail, even if it's not for money directly but for a debt. The author is essentially saying, \"pay me what you owe, or I'll delete these photos.\" \n\nEven if the author owns the rights to the photos, using them as a form of payment for an unrelated debt (unpaid rent) might not be legal. The debt (rent) and the photos are separate issues. The author might have a right to pursue the unpaid rent through legal channels, like small claims court, but holding onto the photos as leverage could be a different matter. \n\nAdditionally, the threat to post messages and sue for slander if the ex-girlfriend accuses him of abuse complicates things. Threatening legal action in bad faith could lead to its own legal issues. \n\nThe resolution where the ex paid the money and the photos were deleted shows that there was a transaction involved, but the initial act of holding the photos as ransom might still be problematic. Even if the author had a model release, the use of the photos as leverage for a debt could cross into illegal territory. \n\nSo, putting it all together: while the author might have had a legal right to the photos, using them to collect an unrelated debt is likely where the mistake lies. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
