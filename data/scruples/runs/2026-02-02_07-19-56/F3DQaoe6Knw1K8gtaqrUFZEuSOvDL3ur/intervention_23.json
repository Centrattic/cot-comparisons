I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a photographer who took nude photos of his girlfriend, who later signed a release form. Then they moved in together, she stopped paying rent, and he kept paying. Years later, she demands he delete the photos. He refuses unless she pays back the rent, and when she threatens him, he threatens to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, her friend gives the money, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the girl signed a waiver giving him the rights. So legally, he might own the photos. But even if he didn't, the user mentions that courts often side with photographers. So maybe he has a legal right to them.\n\nBut then there's the moral aspect. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent seems questionable. Even if he's entitled to the photos, demanding payment for their deletion could be seen as extortion. Also, threatening to expose her messages and sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse is pretty harsh. That's a form of intimidation, which might be illegal or at least ethically wrong.\n\nAnother point: the fact that she stopped paying rent and he kept covering it. He might have a claim for reimbursement, but holding the photos hostage could be a way to force her to pay, which is more of a legal dispute. However, mixing personal matters (the nudes) with a financial claim is problematic. It's like using personal property as a bargaining chip in a financial disagreement, which crosses ethical lines.\n\nAlso, when he threatened to post her messages, that's about her privacy. Even if she had a history of sending messages that might support his case, publicly sharing those messages without her consent could be a violation of her privacy rights. Plus, the mention of suing for slander if she accuses him of abuse is a threat of legal action, which could be considered a crime (criminal threats) depending on jurisdiction.\n\nOn the other hand, he did delete the photos once he received the money, which he had promised. So he followed through on his ultimatum. But the method of getting the money\u2014using the photos as leverage\u2014might not be legal. In some places, blackmail is illegal even if you have something legitimate to hold over someone.\n\nSo even if he had the legal right to the photos, using them to demand payment for a debt is a different matter. It's possible that while he had the right to own the photos, he can't use them to extort money. Extortion is typically when someone uses illegal threats to get money, even if the underlying claim is valid. So if he's threatening to not delete the photos unless she pays, that could be seen as extortion, regardless of the validity of the debt.\n\nAlso, the threat to expose her messages and sue for slander is a strong move. Even if he had evidence, threatening to expose someone's private messages could be a privacy violation. And threatening legal action to deter an accusation is a form of coercion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he might have had the legal rights to the photos, the way he used them\u2014threatening to not delete them unless she paid, and threatening to expose her and sue\u2014crosses into illegal and unethical behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
