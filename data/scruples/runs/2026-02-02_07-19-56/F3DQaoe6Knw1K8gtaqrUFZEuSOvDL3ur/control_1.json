I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a photography business, a relationship, unpaid rent, and the use of nude photos. The author claims he has legal rights to the photos because she signed a release, and he's holding onto the photos until she pays back the rent. The woman then threatens to accuse him of abuse, and he retaliates by threatening to expose her messages and sue her for slander. Eventually, he deletes the photos after receiving the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If she signed a release, he might have the right to keep the photos. But can he withhold them as a form of payment? That's a bit tricky. Usually, legal rights to photos don't allow using them as collateral for unpaid debts unless there's a specific contract clause. Even if he owns the photos, demanding payment for their deletion might be a different matter. It could be seen as using the photos as a bargaining chip, which might not be legally valid. Also, threatening to post her messages could be a form of harassment or blackmail, especially if those messages are private. Threatening legal action for slander is another point\u2014suing for slander requires proof of making false statements, and if he's threatening to do that, that could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. Using personal photos as leverage in a dispute over money might be considered manipulative or unethical, even if he has a point about the rights. The woman's threats of false accusations are bad, but his response of threatening to expose her messages and sue might escalate the situation inappropriately. The fact that he took the photos while in a relationship adds another layer\u2014there could be questions about consent and exploitation, especially if the photos were taken under the influence of the relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, the part where he said he gave the photos to local law enforcement is confusing. Why would he do that? If he did that to protect himself, maybe, but it's unclear. If he's using that as leverage, it's even more questionable. \n\nIn terms of the law, even if he has the rights, can he legally withhold the deletion of the photos as a form of payment? Probably not, because that's not a standard practice. The value of the photos isn't the same as rent, so it's not a valid lien. Additionally, threatening to release private messages might be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. Harassment laws could come into play here. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman had breached the lease and he paid the rent himself, maybe he could have taken legal action to recover the money through a civil court. Using the photos as leverage might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not have a legal right to withhold the photos as a form of payment, and the threats he made could be considered unethical or even illegal. The woman's actions were wrong too, but his response might have crossed the line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
