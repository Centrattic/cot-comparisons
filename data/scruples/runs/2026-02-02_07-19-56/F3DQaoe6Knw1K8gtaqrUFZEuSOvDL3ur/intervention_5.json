I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who took nude photos of their ex-girlfriend and kept them even after their breakup, demanding payment for deleting them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that the girl signed a waiver transferring rights to the photos. Even if that's true, does that cover the right to delete the photos? Or does the author have the right to delete them but is using that as leverage for unpaid rent? Also, the author is holding the photos as a form of payment, which seems like a form of blackmail or coercion. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if legally the author might have the rights, is it morally right to hold someone's private photos to get money, especially from a former partner? The situation is made worse because the author had previously taken the photos consensually during their relationship. Now using those photos to get back at the ex for not paying rent could be seen as exploiting a past relationship for leverage.\n\nThe ex tried to get the photos deleted, and the author is using the unpaid rent (which might be complicated as they were roommates) as a reason to withhold deletion. The author also threatened to post the ex's messages if she accused him of abuse. That seems like an intimidation tactic, which is definitely sketchy, even if he has a point about the photos.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the ex's friends came over and trashed the place, leading to her not paying rent. But if they were both on the lease, maybe there's a responsibility to maintain the apartment. However, the author took on the rent himself, which is commendable, but using that as a reason to hold onto photos is questionable.\n\nLegally, if the waiver was valid, the author may own the photos. But using that ownership to demand payment for deletion could be a misuse of power. It's like saying, \"I have legal rights, so I can extort you with them.\" Even if the law is on their side, the ethics of the situation are murky. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for harassment or blacklisting. Holding someone's private photos and threatening to release them unless they pay money is a form of blackmail. The author's actions could be considered illegal, regardless of the previous agreements about the photos.\n\nThe author also mentions threatening to sue for slander if the ex accuses him of abuse. That's a legal threat, but if the ex had a legitimate claim, the author's response could be seen as trying to silence her. \n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some legal standing in terms of photo rights, the author's actions cross into ethically and possibly legally problematic territory by using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent and threatening to expose messages. The combination of holding private photos, demanding payment, and threatening legal action seems like a misuse of their position and the prior relationship.\n"
