I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario provided. \n\nFirst, the key points here: The author is a photographer who took nude photos of a girl (B) during their relationship. They signed waivers giving him the rights. They lived together, and B stopped paying rent. He continued paying and later asked for payment in exchange for deleting the photos when B requested it.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author was justified in holding onto the photos until he was paid back. Legally, he might have the rights, so maybe he has a case there. But ethically, is it right to use personal photos as leverage for unpaid rent? That's the tricky part.\n\nI need to consider both legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the waivers are valid, he might own the photos and can decide their fate. But morally, using someone's private content as a bargaining chip for money, especially after a breakup, could be seen as manipulative or coercive. Even if he had the legal right, the ethical side is questionable.\n\nAlso, B threatened to accuse him of abuse, which is serious. He responded by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. That could be seen as escalating the conflict, even if he's trying to protect himself. The fact that he had to delete the photos in front of a friend suggests he was holding onto them as leverage, which might be ethically wrong regardless of legal standing.\n\nOn the other hand, B did owe rent and didn't pay. The author might feel wronged and using the photos as payment could be his way of seeking compensation. However, mixing personal debts with private content is a gray area. Even if he has legal rights, the public perception or ethical judgment might side against him because it's a personal matter turned into a negotiation tactic.\n\nAnother angle: the relationship ended, and using photos from that time as leverage could be seen as exploiting the past relationship. People might argue that once the relationship is over, holding onto such photos and using them for personal gain isn't right, even if legally allowed. The author's actions might be viewed as taking advantage of the situation for his benefit, which is ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's threats to post B's messages and sue for slander if she accused him of abuse add another layer. That could be seen as harassment or intimidation, which is problematic regardless of the situation. Even if he's standing up for his rights, the methods he used might cross a line.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have legal grounds to retain the photos, the ethical considerations around using them as leverage for unpaid rent, along with the threats and public exposure, likely place him in the wrong. The manipulation of personal content for financial gain post-breakup is ethically dubious, even if legally permissible in some cases.\n"
