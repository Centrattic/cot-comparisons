I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a photographer who took nude photos of his girlfriend, who signed a rights waiver. They moved in together, she stopped paying rent, and he kept paying. Two years later, she demands he delete the photos. He refuses until she pays back the rent and threatens to expose her messages if she accuses him of abuse. Eventually, she sends a friend to give the money, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentions that she signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos. If that's the case, legally, he might have the right to keep and use them. However, even with legal ownership, there's an ethical component. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent could be problematic. It's a form of coercion.\n\nThen there's the threat to post her messages and sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse. That's a legal threat, which might be a problem even if he has a case. The fact that she actually said she would lie about being abusive is troubling, but threatening to expose her messages in response could be seen as retaliatory or using her own words against her, which might not be ethical.\n\nAlso, the situation with the rent. She left and didn't pay, but he kept paying the lease. The lease was a year, so after that, he moved out. He's holding her accountable for the unpaid rent, which he might be legally entitled to if the lease required both parties to pay. However, using that as leverage to delete the photos is where the ethical issue comes in. It's like a hostage situation\u2014holding the photos as collateral for the debt.\n\nThe author's actions might be legally justified, but ethically, it's questionable to hold onto someone's private photos as punishment or to get money owed. It could be seen as exploiting a power imbalance, even if he has the legal rights. Additionally, the threat to post her messages is a strong move that could be considered harassment or intimidation.\n\nMoreover, the fact that he dug up her past messages to back up his claims shows he was keeping records, which is smart legally, but using them in a threatening manner is where it goes wrong. The ultimatum of paying rent to get the photos deleted is a form of blackmail if the rent was already owed and he's using the photos as leverage.\n\nIn summary, even if the author had legal rights to the photos, the way he used them to extract payment and the threats involved cross into unethical territory. So the answer is likely that he's in the wrong, even if he's not necessarily breaking the law.\n"
