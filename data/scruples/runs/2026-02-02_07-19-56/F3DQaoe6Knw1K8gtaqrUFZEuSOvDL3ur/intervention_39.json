I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who took nude photos of his girlfriend, who signed a release form. They moved in together, she stopped paying rent, left, and he held onto the photos until she paid him back. Two years later, she asks him to delete them, but he demands payment first. She threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she pays him through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The user mentions that she signed a release form, giving him rights to the photos. Even without that, he argues that courts usually side with photographers. So legally, he might have a point. But even if he owns the rights, can he use the photos as leverage for unpaid rent? That's a gray area. The rent and the photos are separate issues. Using the photos to get payment might be considered blackmail or some form of coercion.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if he legally owns the photos, threatening to expose someone unless they pay rent is problematic. It's mixing personal debt with private content. Also, holding onto the photos for two years and then using them as a bargaining chip might be seen as manipulative, especially if the relationship was already strained.\n\nThe girl's threats of false accusations and his response of threatening to post her messages and sue for slander adds another layer. His actions could be seen as retaliatory, which might not be the best approach. However, he did eventually delete the photos once he received the payment, which he had stated as a condition.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Does he have the right to withhold the photos? 2) Is using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent ethical or legal? 3) Are his threats of exposing messages valid or extortionate?\n\nLegally, if he owns the photos, he can choose not to delete them, but using them to collect debt might not be enforceable. Debt collection tactics need to be lawful, and threatening to release private content could be a violation of privacy laws in some jurisdictions. Also, threatening to sue for slander unless someone pays rent might not hold up if there's no actual defamation involved.\n\nEthically, holding personal content hostage for unpaid debts is generally considered wrong. It exploits the person's vulnerability and uses intimate material as a weapon. Even if the debt is valid, the method of collection is questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he used the photos as leverage, which is ethically problematic. Even if he had legal rights to the photos, the way he used them to collect rent could be seen as extortion or emotional manipulation. The threats of posting messages and suing for slander if she accused him of abuse might also cross legal boundaries, depending on the specific laws in his area. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
