I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos taken during a relationship where the author claims legal ownership due to a signed waiver. The key points are:\n\n1. **Legal Rights**: The author mentions a signed waiver transferring rights to the photos. If that's valid, he has the legal right to not delete them. However, even if he owns the rights, there might be ethical or privacy considerations, especially once the relationship ended.\n\n2. **Ultimatum for Rent**: The author is holding onto the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. This seems like a problem because using someone's private photos as collateral for debts is generally unethical and could be illegal. Even if he has legal rights, using them in this way might cross into harassment or blackmail.\n\n3. **Threatening to Post Messages**: The author threatens to expose her Facebook messages if she accuses him of abuse. This is a form of intimidation and could be considered threatening behavior.\n\n4. **Court Considerations**: The user mentions that courts often side with photographers on rights. However, the use of those photos for leverage in a personal dispute might not be protected under law, especially if it's seen as extortion.\n\n5. **Payment and Deletion**: The author deletes the photos only after receiving the money. This transactional approach after the relationship ended might be problematic, especially if it's perceived as exploiting the situation for personal gain.\n\n6. **Public Shaming Threat**: Threatening to post texts online is a strong move and could be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the content is incriminating. This could lead to legal issues for defamation or harassment.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have legal rights to the photos, using them as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent and making threats crosses ethical and possibly legal boundaries. The leverage and threats make the situation problematic, so the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
