I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a photography-related dispute over nude photos and unpaid rent.\n\nFirst, the author and B were in a dating relationship. They took nude photos together, and B signed a release form (rats, probably RATS as in Release and Transfer Statement) giving him rights to the photos. Then, they moved in together, and B stopped paying rent, leading the author to cover the costs. After the lease ended, B asked for the photos to be deleted. The author refuses unless B pays back the rent. B threatens false accusations, and the author counters by threatening to expose her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend pays the money, and the photos are deleted.\n\nNow, the key points here are about legal rights and ethical considerations. Legally, if B signed a valid release, the author likely owns the photos. However, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent is a different matter. Even if he has legal rights, holding onto private content as a form of payment could be seen as unethical or potentially illegal, especially since the rent issue is a separate matter from the photos.\n\nEthically, the author is using personal information (nude photos) to collect a debt, which might be considered coercion. Even if B didn't pay rent, the author should probably have pursued legal channels for that, not used the photos as a bargaining chip. Also, threatening to expose messages and sue for slander if B makes false claims could be problematic, as it might involve retaliation or threats.\n\nAnother angle: the author held onto the photos for two years, which could be seen as prolonging the situation unnecessarily. Even if there was a debt, waiting two years and then using the photos as leverage might not be the right approach. Plus, the author's response to threats (posting texts) could escalate the situation into a legal battle over defamation or privacy.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Even with a release, the ongoing use of the photos as leverage might not have been clearly agreed upon. The initial release might cover the use of the photos, but not necessarily their retention as a form of payment for unrelated debts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have legal rights to the photos, using them to extract payment from B is ethically questionable and possibly legally problematic. It's more appropriate to handle debt through legal means rather than using private content as a bargaining tool. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
