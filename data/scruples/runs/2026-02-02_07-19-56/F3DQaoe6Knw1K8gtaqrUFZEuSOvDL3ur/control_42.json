I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos that were taken during a relationship. The key points here are legal rights to the photos and the demand for payment before deletion.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl signed a release form (rats, probably a typo for R&A, Release and Assignment) giving him rights to the photos. So legally, he might own them. But even if that's the case, is there an ethical obligation to delete them regardless?\n\nThe girl stopped paying rent, which led the author to cover it. Later, when she asks for deletion, he demands payment first. That seems like using the photos as leverage for money. Even if he has legal rights, is it morally right to hold something over someone's head for financial reasons? Especially when the photos are of a nude person, which is sensitive.\n\nThe author also mentions that the woman threatened to accuse him of abuse and manipulation, which he counters by threatening to expose her messages. That sounds like a tit-for-tat situation, which could be problematic. Threatening legal action or public exposure in response to a threat might escalate things and could be considered harassment or extortion, even if he believes he has a valid legal claim.\n\nThe part where he dug up old Facebook messages to back his claims might be justified in a legal context, but using them as leverage in a personal dispute could cross ethical lines. Also, the fact that he waited two years to delete them and then used the money as a condition raises questions about his intentions. It's about whether he's using the photos to extract payment, which could be seen as exploiting someone's vulnerability.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. Even if the author has the legal rights, there might be laws against using private images for coercion. Depending on the jurisdiction, holding onto someone's nude photos and demanding payment could be illegal, regardless of ownership. The threat of public exposure as a response to a threat might also be a form of illegal retaliation.\n\nAlso, the relationship aspect: they were in a relationship, which might imply a different dynamic compared to a professional client-photographer relationship. If the girl was a client, then the situation is clearer, but since they were partners, the lines might be blurred. The lease and rent issues add another layer, but the main issue is the handling of the photos.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have legal rights to the photos, his actions of demanding payment before deletion and using threats could be considered ethically wrong and possibly illegal. Even if he's in the right legally, the way he handled it\u2014using the photos as leverage and threatening exposure\u2014seems to cross ethical boundaries. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
