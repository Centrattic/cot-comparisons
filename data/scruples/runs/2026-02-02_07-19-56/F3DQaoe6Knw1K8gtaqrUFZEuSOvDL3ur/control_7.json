I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about not deleting nude photos of an ex-girlfriend until she pays back the rent she owed.\n\nFirst, the author took nude photos of B when they were in a relationship. B signed a release (waiver) giving him the rights. They moved in together, and B stopped paying rent, leading the author to pay it all. After she left, B asked for the photos to be deleted. The author refused unless she pays back the rent, which she eventually did through a friend. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author claims he has legal rights through the waiver. If that's the case, he might have a legal basis to keep the photos. But using the photos as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent could be an issue. Even if he has legal rights, using them to demand payment for something unrelated (like rent) might be problematic. \n\nAlso, there's the part where B threatened to accuse him of abuse, and he threatened to post her messages and sue for slander. That sounds like a threat, which could be legally risky. Even if he's in the right about the photos, using threats might cross a line.\n\nThen, when she sent the money, he deleted the photos. So he got what he wanted, but the method involved holding something over someone's head for personal gain. Even if the photos were legally his, using them as leverage for rent repayment could be seen as extortion or blackmail, depending on the circumstances. \n\nAnother angle: the rent issue. If B was supposed to pay rent but didn't, the proper way would be to go through legal channels, like small claims court. Taking matters into your own hands by withholding the photos until payment might not be legally permissible. \n\nEven if the author had a valid claim for the rent, combining it with the photos could be exploiting a legal right for personal financial gain, which isn't necessarily allowed. Also, threatening to expose messages where B admitted he owned the rights might be a way to pressure her, which could be seen as harassment or coercion.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might have a legal right to the photos but using them as leverage for unpaid rent, especially with threats, could make him legally or ethically wrong. The threats of posting messages and suing for slander are concerning. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
