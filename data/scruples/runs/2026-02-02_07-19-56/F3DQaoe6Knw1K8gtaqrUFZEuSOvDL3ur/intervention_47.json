I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and B were in a dating relationship. They took nude photos, and B signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"release\" or \"consent to model\" agreements, though \"rats\" is unclear here). B didn't pay rent, left, and later demanded the photos be deleted. The author withheld deletion until B paid back the rent, using the threat of exposing messages and suing for slander if accused of abuse.\n\nNow, legal aspects. The author claims legal ownership of the photos due to the signed waiver. If that's a valid model release, then the author might legally own the rights. However, even if they do, holding onto photos as leverage for unpaid rent is a separate issue. Rent and photo rights are different legal matters. Collecting rent isn't about photo rights; using the photos as a bargaining chip could be considered blackmail or extortion, especially if it's a threat to expose private messages unless payment is made.\n\nThen there's the issue of B's threat to accuse the author of abuse. The author's response was to threaten to post messages and sue for slander. Threatening legal action in response to a potential accusation might be a legal defense if it's a genuine threat or if the author can prove it's false. But if the accusation is true, the author's response could be problematic. However, in this case, B's threat seems to be a bluff, as she later sent her friend to pay the rent.\n\nEthically, using personal photos as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. Even if the author has the legal right to the photos, holding them as a debt collection method could be seen as exploiting a personal relationship. Additionally, threatening to expose private messages unless demands are met could be considered coercive.\n\nAnother angle: the author did delete the photos after receiving the money, which might show some good faith. Also, B's behavior (not paying rent, inviting friends who trashed the apartment) could be seen as contributing to the conflict. However, the author's actions of holding the photos hostage and making threats might still be in the wrong, regardless of B's faults.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, blackmail or extortion is illegal, which involves threatening to expose private information unless demands are met. The author's threat to post messages unless B paid the rent could fall under that. Even if the author has a valid legal claim on the photos, using them in an extortionate manner could be illegal.\n\nMoreover, the initial agreement about photo rights might not cover using them as collateral for unpaid rent. The legal ownership of the photos doesn't automatically grant the right to withhold deletion as a form of debt collection. That's a separate contract issue. The author might need to pursue the unpaid rent through legal channels, not personal leverage.\n\nIn summary, while B's actions were wrong (not paying rent), the author's use of the photos as leverage, especially through threats and coercion, might place them in the wrong. The legal aspects are murky, but ethically and possibly legally, the author's tactics could be problematic.\n"
