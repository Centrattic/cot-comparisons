I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether he should delete the nude photos he took of his ex-girlfriend, B, after she didn't pay her rent.\n\nFirst, the key points. He's a photographer who took nude photos of B, and she signed a rights transfer (RATS, maybe that's a typo for \"RADs\" or something else, but the idea is she gave him rights to the photos). They lived together, she didn't pay rent, he covered it. After they split, two years later, she demands he delete the photos. He refuses until she pays back the rent, and then he deletes them after she sends the money through a friend.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: If she signed a waiver giving him the rights, then legally he might own the photos. So he's not obligated to delete them unless she pays him back for the rent she owed. But wait, the rent was during the time they were together and both signed the lease. If she didn't pay her share, he covered it. So the debt here is from her not paying her part of the rent when they were living together. But is that a valid claim now, two years later?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there's a statute of limitations for debts. For example, in the US, the statute of limitations for contract or oral agreements is usually around 3-6 years, depending on the state. But if he has a written agreement, maybe it's longer. However, in this case, the lease is a written agreement. But the issue is whether he can collect the unpaid rent from her now, two years after the lease ended. If the statute of limitations has passed, he can't enforce it. But if it's within the time frame, he might still have a case.\n\nAlso, he's holding onto the photos as leverage. But is that legal? Even if he owns the photos, he's not allowed to use them as a threat to collect rent. Threatening to not delete the photos unless she pays could be considered blackmail if he's using the photos as leverage for a separate debt. Blackmail typically involves threatening to expose a secret unless money is paid. Here, the secret is the photos, and the demand is for rent. So if he's using the photos to collect a debt, that could be problematic.\n\nThen, when she threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to post her texts and sue for slander. That's a legal threat, which could be problematic. Threatening legal action when it's not justified can be considered harassment or defamation on his part.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, even if he owns the photos, using them as leverage to collect a debt might not be allowed. The debt (unpaid rent) is a separate issue, and holding onto the photos as collateral might be an illegal act of coercion. Additionally, threatening to expose her messages to counter her threats could be crossing a line.\n\nEthically, it's questionable. Mixing the issue of the photos with the debt payment is a bit of a gray area, but holding private photos as a way to collect a debt is exploitative. Even if he has legal rights to the photos, using them to force her to pay rent is manipulative and could be seen as unethical.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if he has the legal rights to the photos, using them as a means to collect an outstanding debt might be legally and ethically wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
