I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who took nude photos of his ex-girlfriend, and she owed him rent. The ex wants him to delete the photos, but he's holding onto them until she pays back the rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. He mentions she signed a release or something, giving him rights. If that's a valid contract, he legally owns the photos. But even if that's the case, using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent might be problematic. Even if he has the rights, can he demand payment in exchange for deleting them? That seems like a form of blackmail or extortion. Because he's essentially holding her data hostage for money she owes him. \n\nThe ex says she'll accuse him of abuse, and he responds by threatening to post her messages. That part could be intimidation. Also, the fact that she left him and stopped paying rent, but he kept paying to avoid getting kicked out. Then, he's using the owed rent as a reason to not delete the photos. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if he's owed money, can he legally hold onto someone's private photos until he's paid? That might not be allowed. It's possible that while he has the rights to the photos, using them to force payment is a different issue. There's a difference between owning the rights to the photos and using them as leverage for a debt. \n\nAlso, if she threatened to lie and he threatened to post her messages, that could be a legal conflict. But the core issue is whether holding the photos hostage is acceptable. Even if he's in the right about the photos, demanding payment in exchange for deleting them might cross into illegal territory. Blackmail is when you threaten to reveal private information unless you receive payment. So if he's threatening to leak photos unless she pays back rent, that could be considered blackmail, regardless of whether he owns the photos. \n\nMoreover, the fact that her friends paid the money and he deleted the photos in front of them might not change the situation. The method of holding the photos for the debt could still be wrong. Even if he had a contract for the photos, using that as leverage for a personal debt he was owed is a different matter. \n\nLegally, he might have the right to the photos but not the right to use them to extort money. So the author could be in the wrong for using the photos as leverage. Therefore, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a legal concept that allows someone to demand payment for services rendered. However, the services here were the photos, which he already sold, and the debt was from rent. Mixing two different obligations here\u2014payment for photos and unpaid rent. So even if she owed him rent, he can't hold the photos as collateral unless there was a prior agreement. \n\nIf there was no agreement to withhold photos until rent is paid, then demanding payment now as leverage would be separate from the original contract. Therefore, he's mixing two separate obligations, which could be problematic. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
