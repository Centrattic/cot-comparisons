I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. So, the situation involves some legal rights to photos and a dispute over rent.\n\nFirst, the author and a girl named B took nude photos during their relationship. She signed waivers giving him the rights to the photos. Then, they moved in together. She stopped paying rent, he kept paying, and after the lease ended, she wanted him to delete the photos. He refused unless she paid back the rent. She then threatened to accuse him of abuse, which he countered by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sent a friend to give him the money, and he deleted the photos.\n\nSo, the key points here are about legal rights to the photos and whether holding onto them until he's paid back for the rent is justified. Let me break this down.\n\nLegal Rights: If she signed a model release (waiver), then he legally owns the rights to the photos. Even without that, in some jurisdictions, photographers might have certain rights, but it's not universal. However, using nude photos can be a gray area, especially if there's a privacy issue.\n\nRent Debt: She didn't pay her share of the rent. He paid it all. If they were joint tenants, he could be entitled to reimbursement from her. But how long can he hold onto that debt? If she's asking for the photos to be deleted, but he's using that as leverage to get his money back, is that legal?\n\nThreatening to Post Messages: When she threatened to accuse him of abuse, he said he would post her messages. That could be a form of retaliation or even harassment. Threatening legal action (suing for slander) might be a way to intimidate her.\n\nUltimatum: Holding onto the photos until she pays off the debt. If he legally owns the rights, he can decide when to delete them, but using the debt as a ransom might be crossing a line. Also, if the debt is a valid claim, he should pursue it through legal channels (like small claims court) rather than using the photos as leverage.\n\nHer actions: She did threaten to lie about him, which is wrong. But his response of threatening to expose her messages and sue for slander could be seen as equally problematic. Using personal information to counter a threat might be a form of blackmail or coercion.\n\nDeleting the photos after payment: Once she paid, he deleted them. So, he did follow through on his end. But the question is whether his leverage was appropriate.\n\nPotential Issues:\n1. Even if he owns the photos, holding them as a debt collection method could be unethical or illegal, depending on the circumstances. It's like using personal data as collateral, which might not be allowed.\n2. Threatening to expose private messages could be a violation of her privacy or harassment.\n3. Threatening legal action (slander) to counter her accusation might be a legal tactic, but if it's not a real threat, it could be seen as intimidation.\n\nLegal Perspective: In many places, you can't legally hold someone's property or data to collect a debt. That's usually what a debt collection agency does, but there are specific laws around that. Additionally, using nude photos without consent can be illegal in some contexts, even if you have rights to them, if it's considered non-consensual distribution after the fact.\n\nEthical Perspective: Even if there's a legal argument, ethically, using someone's personal photos as leverage for a debt is questionable. It's using sensitive information against them, which can be considered a form of coercion or emotional abuse.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he used the photos as leverage to collect a debt, which could be seen as blackmail or unethical behavior, regardless of his legal rights to the photos. Additionally, threatening to expose private messages and suing for slander crosses into intimidation. Even if he had valid reasons (unpaid rent), the method of collection was inappropriate.\n"
