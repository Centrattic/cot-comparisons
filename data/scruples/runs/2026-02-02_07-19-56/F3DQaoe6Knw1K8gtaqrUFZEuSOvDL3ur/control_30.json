I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The main points are about nude photos taken during a relationship where the author claims legal ownership via a signed rights agreement. The ex-girlfriend (B) stopped paying rent after a conflict and later demanded deletion of the photos. The author withholds deletion until he gets the unpaid rent, which eventually happens through B's friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The author mentions that B signed a waiver giving him the rights. If that's true, then legally, he might have the right to keep the photos. However, even if he owns the rights, can he legally hold something hostage for unpaid debts? That's a different question. In many places, using someone's property (here, monetary debt) as leverage might be a civil matter, but threatening to release private photos unless debt is paid could be seen as extortion or blackmail, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, the author threatened to post texts where B admitted he owned the photos and agreed to the terms. This could be a form of using private communications against her, which might be legally permissible but ethically questionable. The act of withholding deletion as a form of leverage for unpaid rent might not be enforceable in court because the unpaid rent is a separate issue from the ownership of the photos. The author is mixing two different legal matters: property rights (photos) and contractual obligations (rent).\n\nAdditionally, the author claims he has the rights to the photos, but even with a signed waiver, nude photos can be a sensitive area. In some jurisdictions, the subject has certain rights to privacy, which might override the photographer's rights if the photos are considered personal or intimate. Even if the author owns the copyright, the subject might have a right to have them deleted to protect their privacy, especially if they were taken during a relationship and later want them gone.\n\nThe author's response of demanding payment for deletion might be seen as extortion. Holding onto someone's personal content and demanding payment for its removal can be illegal in some places. The fact that he threatened to post her messages if she accused him of abuse could be considered retaliation or harassment, which might not be protected under the law.\n\nFurthermore, the author's actions could be seen as exploiting a position of power. B might feel forced to pay the rent debt through her friend, not because there was a legal obligation but due to the threat of public exposure. That could be coercive.\n\nSo, putting this together, even if the author has legal rights to the photos, using them as leverage for unpaid rent might be legally and ethically wrong. The situation involves threats, coercion, and mixing of unrelated obligations, which could cross into illegal or unethical behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong even if he had a signed waiver.\n"
