I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a photographer who took nude photos of his girlfriend (B), who signed a rights assignment. They moved in together, but she stopped paying rent and left. Later, she demands the photos be deleted, and he refuses unless she pays back the rent. He threatens to post their messages and sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse.\n\nFirst, legal ownership of the photos. If B signed a valid waiver transferring rights, then the author might legally own the photos. But even if he does, holding onto them as leverage for unpaid rent is a red flag. Rent and photo rights are separate issues. Using one to offset the other could be unethical or illegal. It's like holding a debt hostage, which might not be enforceable. Plus, threatening legal action for rent through this method could be seen as extortion or coercion.\n\nThen there's the threat to expose her messages. That's a serious threat, especially if the messages contain private admissions. Even if the author is in the right about the photo rights, threatening to post someone's private messages is a violation of privacy and could be considered harassment or intimidation. The mention of suing for slander is another layer of legal threat, which might cross into bullying territory.\n\nAlso, the author mentions giving the photos to local law enforcement. If the photos are legal and consensual, why hand them over? Maybe to protect himself if she made false accusations. But that could be a preemptive move, which might not be necessary. \n\nThe payment from her friend two months later and the deletion in front of her\u2014this shows that the author followed through on his threats. But the whole situation seems to be a power play where he's using the photos as a bargaining chip, which is morally questionable even if he's legally in the right. \n\nLegally, he might own the photos, but ethically, holding them as ransom for unpaid rent is problematic. Also, threatening to expose someone's private communications is a serious matter and could lead to legal consequences for him. The author's actions might be seen as abusive in their own right, even if B acted poorly. People have rights to privacy and protection from coercion, regardless of past behavior.\n\nSo, even if the author has legal rights, his methods of enforcing them are questionable. He's mixing personal debts (rent) with the handling of private photos, which is a conflict of interests. The threats to expose private messages and the use of the photos as leverage could make him legally and ethically culpable. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
