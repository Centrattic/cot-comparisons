I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves nude photos, legal rights, and some kind of financial dispute. \n\nFirst, the author took nude photos of his girlfriend, B, and they signed waivers giving him the rights. Then there was an issue with her not paying rent, so he continued paying to avoid eviction. Later, when B asked for the photos to be deleted, he refused until she paid back the rent she owed. She threatened to accuse him of abuse, so he countered by saying he'd post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sent money through a friend, and he deleted the photos.\n\nHmm, the main points here are the legal ownership of the photos and the use of the unpaid rent as a bargaining chip. Legally, if the waivers are valid, he might have the right to keep the photos. However, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent could be problematic. Even if he has legal rights, holding someone's private photos to get money they owe might be considered extortion or blackmail, especially since she didn't sign the lease. The lease was signed by both, but if she didn't pay her share, he could have pursued legal action for that. Instead, he used the photos as a threat, which could be illegal, regardless of the rent issue.\n\nAlso, threatening to post her messages if she accused him of abuse might be a form of retaliation or intimidation. Even if she did send messages that could be used, threatening to expose them could be a legal issue. Slander is about false statements, so if she was going to lie, maybe he's defending himself, but the threats might still be crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of morality, holding onto photos as leverage for unpaid debts, especially in a personal relationship, is ethically questionable. It's exploiting a personal situation for financial gain, which might be seen as wrong. Legally, even if he had the rights, the method of enforcement could be an issue. There are laws against extortion, and using sensitive material to demand payment might fall under that. So even if he had a legal claim to the photos, the way he enforced it could be illegal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong both morally and possibly legally because of the extortion-like behavior, even if the initial ownership of the photos was legitimate. The threats and use of personal messages as leverage could be problematic.\n"
