I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFirst, the situation involves nude photos taken during a relationship. The girl, B, paid for the photos and signed a release, so the author legally owns the rights. That's a key point. If she signed a model release, then he has the legal right to keep and use the photos, right? But then she later demands they be deleted, and he ties that to her paying back rent she didn't pay. \n\nNow, the rent issue: they were roommates, she didn't pay rent, and he had to cover it. He kept paying the rent to avoid being evicted. So he's out of pocket because of her not contributing. When she left, he still had to pay the full rent. Now, two years later, she's asking for the photos deleted. He's holding onto the photos until she pays him back the rent. \n\nWait, but he's using her debt to him as leverage to get her to pay back the rent. Is that ethical? Legally, if she owes him money, he could pursue that through the courts. Using the photos as leverage might be a legal tactic, but is it morally right? Also, he mentions he's threatening to post her messages and sue her for slander if she accuses him of abuse. That sounds like a threat, which might be crossing a line. \n\nLegally, if he owns the photos due to the release, he can keep them unless there's a legal obligation to delete. But using the photos as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent is a different matter. Also, when she threatened to lie and report him, he threatened to expose her messages and sue. That could be considered harassment or even blackmail. \n\nThe problem here is mixing personal matters. The photos and the rent are separate issues. He's using the photos to collect a debt, which might not be right. Even if he has a legal right to the photos, holding them hostage for unpaid rent is more of a civil matter. He should probably take her to small claims court for the rent, instead of using the photos as leverage. \n\nAlso, the threats to sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse might be problematic. If she actually did accuse him, then suing for slander could be a legal action, but threatening that in advance might not be acceptable. \n\nSo putting it all together: he's using the photos to collect a debt, which is a civil issue, and his threats could be seen as intimidation. Even if he has legal rights over the photos, the way he's handling the situation is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
