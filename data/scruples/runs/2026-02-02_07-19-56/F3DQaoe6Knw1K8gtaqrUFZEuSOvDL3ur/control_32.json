I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not deleting nude photos of a girl he legally owns the rights to until she paid back her share of the rent.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and B dated, took nude photos with her consent and a signed release (rats, maybe a typo for RATS? Maybe Rights Assignment Agreement). They moved in together, but B stopped paying rent. After the lease ended, the author kept paying. Two years later, B asks for the photos to be deleted. The author, who claims to own the rights via the waiver, refuses unless she pays back the rent. B threatens to accuse him of abuse, so he threatens to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend gives the money, and the photos are deleted.\n\nLegally, if the author indeed has the rights to the photos, he's not obligated to delete them unless there's a contract stating otherwise. However, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent isn't straightforward. Rent is a separate issue from photo rights. Even if he owns the rights, using them to demand payment could be seen as blackmail or coercion. Threatening to post private messages and sue for slander if she makes accusations could be problematic, as it crosses into intimidation. Also, B's threat to lie about abuse is serious, but the author's response might not be justified. While he might have a legal right to the photos, the ethical aspect of using them as leverage for a financial dispute is questionable. The situation involves power dynamics and potential emotional coercion, which might make the author's actions ethically wrong even if not strictly illegal.\n"
