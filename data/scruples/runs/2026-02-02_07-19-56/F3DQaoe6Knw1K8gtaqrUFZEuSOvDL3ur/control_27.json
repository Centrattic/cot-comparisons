I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves someone who took nude photos of their girlfriend, who later didn't pay rent and left. Now the girl is asking them to delete the photos, but the author is holding out until she pays back the rent.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author mentions that the girl signed a rights transfer, so he legally owns the photos. If that's the case, then legally, he has the right to keep them. But there's also the issue of using those photos as leverage for unpaid rent. Even if he owns the photos, can he demand payment in exchange for deleting them? That seems like a gray area. Legally, the debt (unpaid rent) is separate from the photos. So perhaps using the photos as a way to collect on the debt could be problematic. It might be considered blackmail or some form of coercion, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is holding personal and sensitive photos over a financial dispute. Even if he has the legal right, is it ethical to use someone's nudes to get them to pay a debt? The girl is in a vulnerable position here. Also, the author mentions that she threatened to accuse him of abuse, which he then counters by threatening to post her messages. That part seems like a threat of retaliation, which could be legally and ethically questionable.\n\nThe resolution part: the friend gives the money, and he deletes the photos. But the initial demand to pay rent in exchange for deleting the photos might still be problematic. Even if he had the right to own the photos, using them as leverage for a debt isn't something that's typically enforceable. Courts usually separate property rights from other debts. So, while he might not be in legal trouble for not deleting them, the moral judgment is that he's using someone's private content as a bargaining chip, which is wrong.\n\nSo, even if he had the legal rights, the ethical and moral stance here would lean towards him being in the wrong for holding the photos as a way to collect on a debt. Plus, threatening legal action (suing for slander) if she accused him of abuse is another layer of coercion. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
