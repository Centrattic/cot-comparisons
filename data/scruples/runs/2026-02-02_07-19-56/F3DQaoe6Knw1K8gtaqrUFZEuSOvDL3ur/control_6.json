I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone who took nude photos of their ex-girlfriend and is holding onto them until she pays back the rent she owed. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they both signed a lease and the girl stopped paying rent. The author kept paying it, and when the lease ended, he moved out. Then, two years later, the ex contacts him wanting the photos deleted. The author refuses unless she pays back the rent she owed, and when she threatens to accuse him of abuse, he says he'll post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nLegally, the author says she signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos. If that's true, he might have the legal right to keep them. But ethically, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent is a different matter. Even if he owns the rights, demanding payment for something unrelated (like rent) might be problematic. The rent issue is a separate dispute from the ownership of the photos. So, by holding the photos hostage until she pays rent, he's mixing two different issues. \n\nAlso, when she threatened to lie and report him, his response was to threaten to post her messages and sue for slander. That could be seen as retaliatory. Even if he has legal rights, threatening to expose private messages might not be the best approach, especially if those messages are private. \n\nMoreover, the author mentions he's unsure if he did something wrong, which suggests he's aware that his actions might cross ethical lines. Even if he has legal rights, the ethical side of holding someone's personal information or assets to collect a debt is questionable. It's like a form of blackmail or coercion. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might not be wrong if the waiver is valid, but ethically and morally, holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent is wrong. The way he handled the threats (threatening to post her messages) also adds to the ethical issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
