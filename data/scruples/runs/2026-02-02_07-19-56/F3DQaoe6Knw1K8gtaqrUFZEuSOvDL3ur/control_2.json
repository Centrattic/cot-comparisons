I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author took nude photos of his girlfriend, B, who signed a rights assignment (rats?) transferring ownership to him. They moved in together, she stopped paying rent, he covered it, then after the lease ended, she asked him to delete the photos. He refused until she paid back the rent. She threatened to accuse him of abuse, and he countered by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she paid him, and he deleted the photos.\n\nNow, legal aspects: The author claims to own the photos via a signed waiver. If that's legally valid, then he has the right to not delete them. But even if he does, using someone's nude photos can be tricky. Plus, he's withholding rent money he's owed as leverage to delete the photos. That's mixing personal debt with personal content. Also, threatening to post her messages and suing for slander is a legal threat, which might be problematic. \n\nMoral/ethical angle: Even if he has legal rights, holding someone's private photos to collect a debt could be seen as unethical. Also, using the threat of exposing her messages as leverage might cross into harassment or blackmail. The fact that she threatened to accuse him of abuse adds another layer\u2014how he responded could be seen as defensive, but threatening to post her texts and sue for slander might not be the best approach.\n\nPossible issues: Even if the waiver is valid, the author is using the photos as leverage for a debt. Normally, you can't withhold someone's property (like photos) to collect a debt unless there's a legal mechanism for that. Also, if the rent was unpaid, he could have pursued legal action for the debt, not hold the photos hostage. Additionally, the threat to post her messages could be a violation of privacy or defamation laws depending on the content.\n\nSo, even if the author has legal rights over the photos, using them as leverage for an unrelated debt and making legal threats could be morally wrong and possibly illegal. The situation is complex, but the author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation unethically.\n"
