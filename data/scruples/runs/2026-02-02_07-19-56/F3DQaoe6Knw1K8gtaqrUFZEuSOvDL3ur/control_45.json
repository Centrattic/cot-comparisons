I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a guy who took nude photos of his ex-girlfriend, B, and they had a lease together. B stopped paying rent, and the guy ended up paying for both during the lease. Two years later, B asks him to delete the photos. He refuses unless she pays back the rent she owed, which she eventually does through a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The user mentioned that B signed a release or waiver giving him the rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, he might have a right to use or keep the photos. However, even with legal rights, there's the question of ethics. Demanding payment for photos as a condition for deletion, especially after a personal relationship that ended badly, might be seen as using his power over her.\n\nAlso, the fact that she stopped paying rent and he had to cover it raises issues about their lease agreement. They both signed the lease, so maybe they had a mutual responsibility. But if B left and stopped paying, he might have been within his rights to continue paying to avoid eviction. However, holding the photos as leverage for her debts could be problematic. It's like using personal data as collateral for financial debts, which might not be a standard practice.\n\nThen there's the part where B threatened to accuse him of abuse, which he responded to by threatening to post her messages and sue her for slander. Threatening legal action in response to false accusations could be justified if he truly has evidence, but it's still a risky move. However, he did follow through on his word, deleting the photos after receiving the money. \n\nAnother angle is the privacy aspect. Even if he legally owns the photos, keeping them as a form of punishment or leverage after a breakup might be ethically wrong. People might expect that after a relationship ends, sensitive content like nudes would be deleted unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise. Using the photos to collect a debt could be seen as exploiting his position.\n\nAlso, the fact that she paid through a friend two years later suggests she might have felt indebted or manipulated, but the author's approach of making her pay back rent for the photos' deletion might be crossing a line. It's a mix of legal rights and personal ethics. Legally, he might be in the right if the waivers are valid, but ethically, holding onto her photos as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent could be viewed as unfair or vengeful.\n\nIn summary, while there might be legal grounds supporting his actions, the ethical implications of using personal photos as leverage for a financial debt, especially in a past relationship, likely put him in the wrong. The demand for payment as a condition for deleting the photos is where the issue lies, regardless of the lease issues. So, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
