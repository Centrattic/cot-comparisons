I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author took nude photos of his girlfriend B while they were together. They signed a rights transfer (RATS) giving him ownership of the photos. Later, when their relationship ended and B stopped paying rent, he kept paying the rent and now he's holding onto the photos until B pays back what she owed.\n\nFirst, legally, if the waiver is valid and B did sign it, then the author might have the right to keep the photos. But even if there's a legal argument, there's also the ethical side. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for money, especially after a personal relationship ends, seems questionable. Even if there's a contract, blackmail or holding personal content hostage isn't really right. The author threatened to post texts where B admitted to letting him keep the photos, which could be seen as intimidation. Also, the part where he's holding the photos until she repays rent feels like taking advantage of their past relationship. Even if he's legally allowed to keep them, the way he's using them as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent isn't ethical. The fact that B's friend had to pay him on her behalf adds another layer of awkwardness. So, even if there's some legal standing here, the author's actions cross into moral wrong by using the photos as leverage beyond just keeping them. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
