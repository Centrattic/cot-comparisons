I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author took nude photos of a girl (B) during their relationship. She signed waivers giving him rights to the photos. They moved in together, but she stopped paying rent, leading him to pay the rest. Years later, she demands he delete the photos. He refuses until she pays back the rent, threatening to post her messages if she accuses him of abuse. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes them.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether he had the right to hold the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. Legally, even if he owned the rights, using them to collect a debt might be problematic. He's essentially using personal photos as a form of payment, which seems like coercion. Also, the initial situation\u2014taking nude photos of a romantic partner\u2014could raise ethical concerns about consent and power dynamics, especially if there was an imbalance during the relationship.\n\nThen there's the threat to post her messages if she accused him of abuse. That's a form of retaliation and could be considered harassment or intimidation. Even if he has legal rights, his actions might cross into ethical or even legal boundaries by using threats and holding personal data as leverage. Additionally, using the photos and messages as leverage could be seen as blackmail, depending on the context.\n\nSo while he might have legal rights over the photos, his actions in withholding them for debt and threatening to expose private messages could be morally wrong. The ethical angle here is about how he's using his position and the personal data against her for financial gain, which might not be justifiable regardless of the lease situation.\n"
