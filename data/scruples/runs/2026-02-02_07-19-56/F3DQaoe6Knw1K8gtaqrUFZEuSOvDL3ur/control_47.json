I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who took nude photos of his ex-girlfriend (B) while they were dating. They signed a rights agreement, and she paid him for the photos. Later, when they split up, she stopped paying rent, he ended up covering it, and then two years later she asked him to delete the photos. He refused unless she paid him back for the rent she owed. Eventually, she sent money through a friend, he deleted the photos, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the legal aspects. The user mentions that B signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos. If that's a valid legal document, then he legally owns the photos. So, from a legal standpoint, he might have the right to keep them even if she wanted them deleted. But there's also the issue of using the photos as leverage for her unpaid rent. Even if he has legal rights over the photos, using them to collect a debt might be questionable. That's a bit of a gray area. Normally, you can't hold someone's personal items as collateral unless there's a contract in place for that. But here, the debt is from rent, which isn't directly related to the photos. So maybe he's mixing two separate issues: the ownership of the photos and the unpaid rent.\n\nThen there's the part where she threatened to accuse him of abuse. He responded by threatening to post her messages and sue her for slander. That sounds pretty aggressive. Even if he feels wronged, threatening legal action over a slander accusation could be problematic. Also, when she actually sent the money through a friend, he deleted the photos. So he followed through on his ultimatum. But does that mean it's okay? The issue is whether he had the right to make the ultimatum in the first place. \n\nEthically, it's another angle. Even if he's in the right legally, holding someone's photos hostage to collect a debt might be seen as unfair or manipulative. The photos are private, and using them as a bargaining chip for unrelated debts could be considered an abuse of power. Plus, she was in a vulnerable position after breaking up, and he might be exploiting that. However, he did delete them once he received the money, so maybe he's not keeping them for malicious purposes. \n\nAnother point is the part where he gave the photos to local law enforcement. If the photos are legal and he owns the rights, why would he need to give them to the police? Maybe that's a red herring or a misunderstanding on his part. Also, when she threatened to lie about abuse, he dug up her Facebook messages to defend himself. That shows he's trying to protect himself legally, which is understandable, but threatening to post those messages might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have a case with the signed waiver, but using the photos to collect rent debt is a different matter. Ethically, it's questionable because he's using one issue (photo rights) to leverage another (unpaid rent). His response to her threats was also aggressive, which could be seen as retaliatory. Even if he's in the right in terms of photo ownership, the way he handled the situation\u2014threatening legal action and suing for slander\u2014might be the wrong approach. \n\nThe key question is whether he was justified in holding the photos until she paid the rent. Since the rent was unrelated to the photos, this could be considered a form of blackmail or extortion, depending on the context. If there's no legal agreement that allows him to hold onto her personal items as collateral for debt, then he's in the wrong. But if the lease agreement allowed for such actions, then maybe not. However, typically, landlords can't just hold onto personal property for unpaid rent; they have to go through legal eviction processes. So in that case, he's not a landlord anymore, the lease is up, and he's acting outside of his legal rights by holding her photos to get money for past debts.\n\nTherefore, despite the legal ownership of the photos, using them to collect an unrelated debt is wrong. The author might be in the wrong because he's mixing two separate issues and using one to leverage the other. The fact that he followed through on his threats after receiving payment doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
