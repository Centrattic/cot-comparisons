I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and a girl, B, were dating. They took nude photos of her, she paid him, and he has the rights via a waiver. Then they moved in together, but she stopped paying rent when her friends trashed the apartment. He continued paying the rent. After the lease ended, she came back and asked him to delete the photos. He refuses until she pays him back for the rent she owed. She then threatens to accuse him of abuse, which he counters by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, her friend gives him the money, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The author claims he has the rights to the photos because of the waiver. If that's true, then he has a legal right to keep them. But even if he does, is it ethical to hold them for ransom? Using the photos as leverage to get her to pay back rent? That seems like a problem. Rent and photo rights are separate issues. Even if he's owed money, using the photos as a bargaining chip might be exploitative. Also, threatening to post her messages if she makes a false accusation could be seen as a threat or blackmail, which might be illegal. Suing for slander is one thing, but threatening to expose her messages as a form of retaliation could cross legal boundaries.\n\nThen, the fact that she might have been in a vulnerable position. They were in a dating relationship, and the photos are nude. Using that as leverage could be seen as taking advantage of her in a prior relationship. Even if there was a waiver, the power dynamic might affect the legality or ethics. Also, her threatening to lie about abuse is serious. If she actually made a false report, that's a crime, but the author's response of threatening to expose her messages might be a form of coercion or intimidation, which isn't cool.\n\nAnother angle: The author is mixing personal grievances (unpaid rent) with personal content (nudes). Even if he has legal rights over the photos, holding onto them to get money is a form of blackmail. Blackmail typically involves threatening to expose secrets unless money is paid. The author is essentially doing that, which is illegal regardless of the rights he claims.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and vengeful. Instead of going through legal channels to recover the rent (like suing her for the unpaid rent), he's using the photos as leverage. That's not the right approach. He should have pursued the money through the legal system, not using the photos as a bargaining chip.\n\nMoreover, threatening to expose her messages unless she pays is a form of coercion. Even if the messages were incriminating for her, using them to demand payment is problematic. The author's actions might have crossed into extortion, which is a criminal offense.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have legal rights over the photos, his use of them to extract money from B by threatening to delete them unless she pays back rent is ethically wrong and potentially illegal. The situation is a mix of personal grievances and leveraging sensitive material, which is exploitative and not a proper way to handle debt recovery.\n"
