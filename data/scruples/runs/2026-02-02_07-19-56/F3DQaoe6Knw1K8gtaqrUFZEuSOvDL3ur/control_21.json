I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos taken during a relationship where the author claims to own the rights via a signed release. The ex-girlfriend (B) later demands the photos be deleted, and the author withholds deletion until she pays back rent she owed.\n\nFirst, legal rights: If B signed a model release (rats might be a typo for \"model releases\" or \"releases and assignments\") transferring the rights to the author, then legally the author might have ownership. However, even with such a release, can the author use it as leverage for unpaid rent? That's a gray area. Using someone's nude photos as a payment method could be unethical or even illegal, even if they signed a release. It's akin to using personal property as collateral without a legal agreement.\n\nEmotional and ethical aspects: The author is holding personal photos hostage over a debt. Even if the debt was legitimate, using private images as leverage might be considered manipulative or coercive. The ex's threat to accuse the author of abuse could be a red flag, but the author responded by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. This back-and-forth shows a lack of healthy resolution.\n\nLegal implications: If the author has a valid release, courts might side with them regarding photo rights. However, using the photos as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent isn't a standard practice. There might be issues with extortion or blackmail if the author is using the photos to demand money outside of a legal agreement. Also, threatening to post private messages could have its own legal consequences.\n\nEthically, even if the author has legal rights, the situation is about leveraging personal and sensitive material for personal gain. This is generally frowned upon. The author's actions could be seen as exploiting a past relationship to gain financial benefit from the ex, which is unethical.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have legal rights over the photos, using them as a payment method for rent is ethically questionable and could be considered wrong. The leverage of personal photos for financial gain, combined with the coercive tactics, likely places the author in the wrong.\n"
