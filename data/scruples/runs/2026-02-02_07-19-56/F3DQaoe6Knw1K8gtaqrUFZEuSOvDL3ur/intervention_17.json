I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not deleting the nude photos until the ex-girlfriend paid back rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The author mentions that the girl signed a release form (waiver) giving him rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then he might have the right to keep them. But even if the waiver was signed, can he withhold the photos as leverage for unpaid rent? That seems iffy. Rent and photo rights are separate issues. Using one as leverage for the other might be unethical or illegal.\n\nThen there's the threat part. The author says he would post her messages if she accused him of abuse. Threatening someone with exposure, even if they might have done something, could be considered harassment or intimidation. Also, suing for slander if she made false accusations\u2014slander is about false spoken statements, but if he's threatening to post her messages, that could complicate things legally.\n\nThe situation where the author had to cover the rent because her friends trashed the place\u2014maybe he had a legal right to withhold part of the rent for damages, but using photos as payment is not standard. Mixing personal property (photos) with financial obligations (rent) in that way might not hold up in court.\n\nAlso, the fact that he deleted the photos in front of her friend after receiving payment\u2014this shows that he was holding onto the photos for financial gain, which could be seen as using someone's private images as a debt collection method. That's problematic, regardless of the waiver.\n\nEven if he legally owns the rights, the ethical side is about respecting someone's privacy and dignity. Using nude photos as leverage, even if he has rights, crosses into exploitation. Plus, the threat to post her messages if she accused him of abuse is a form of coercion.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, there might be some standing due to the waiver, but ethically and possibly legally, using photos as a payment method for rent and threatening exposure is wrong. The author's actions were manipulative and took advantage of a vulnerable situation. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
