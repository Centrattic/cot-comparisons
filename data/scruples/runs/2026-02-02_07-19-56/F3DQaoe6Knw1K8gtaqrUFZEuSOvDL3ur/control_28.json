I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl (B) were in a relationship. They took nude photos, and she signed some rights over to him. Then they moved in together. B started inviting friends who trashed the apartment, leading to the author cutting off her friends. B then decided not to pay rent, leaving the author to cover it. After the lease ended, the author moved out. Two years later, B demands he delete the photos. He refuses unless she pays back the rent, citing the rights she signed. She threatens to accuse him of abuse, so he threatens to post texts and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the legal rights and ethical behavior. Legally, if B signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos, he might have a case to not delete them. However, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent could be problematic. Even if he has legal rights, holding her to a financial obligation from the lease might be a separate issue. Also, threatening to sue her for slander if she accuses him of abuse could be seen as intimidation, which is unethical and possibly illegal. The threats to post private messages could be another red flag. Ethically, holding onto personal photos because of a past debt seems unfair, especially if the lease ended and the debt is no longer a current obligation. Plus, the situation has a power dynamic from their past relationship, which adds complexity. Even if he has legal standing, the way he handled it\u2014using threats and leverage\u2014probably crosses into being in the wrong. So, while he might have legal rights, his actions are ethically questionable, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
