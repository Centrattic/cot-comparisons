I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves nude photos, legal rights, and a dispute over unpaid rent.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author took nude photos of B, who paid for them and signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"releases\" or \"waivers\"). They moved in together, B stopped paying rent, left, and later demanded the photos be deleted. The author withheld deletion until B paid the owed rent, then received payment from B's friend and deleted the photos.\n\nLegally, the photos are part of the author's rights if B signed a proper model release. But using them as payment for unpaid rent complicates things. The author is holding onto the photos as leverage for money owed, which could be seen as a form of blackmail or extortion since they're using private content to get payment. Even if the author has legal rights to the photos, threatening to release them unless someone pays might not be legal. Additionally, the author threatened to sue for slander if B accused them of abuse, which could be a tactic to suppress her complaints. The fact that the author used her own messages to confirm the terms adds to the complexity. While the legal ownership is on the author's side, the moral and ethical aspects are questionable because they're using the photos as leverage for financial gain, which could be considered exploitative. So even if they have the legal right, their actions might be morally wrong or illegal depending on jurisdiction.\n"
