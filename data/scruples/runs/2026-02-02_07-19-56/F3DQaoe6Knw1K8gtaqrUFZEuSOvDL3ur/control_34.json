I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A or B, so I need to be concise.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author took nude photos of a girl (B) while they were dating. B signed a rights transfer (rats, maybe a typo for RATS? Like a model release?), giving the author ownership. They moved in together, and when B stopped paying rent, the author kept paying. Two years later, B asks for the photos to be deleted. The author refuses until B pays back the rent she owed, which she eventually does through a friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are about legal rights and ethical behavior. Legally, if B signed a model release or waiver transferring rights, the author might have the legal standing to keep the photos. However, the ethical aspect is trickier. Even if the author has legal rights, using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent could be seen as extortion or blackmail, which is illegal. The author is essentially holding the photos hostage until B pays back money she was supposed to pay for rent, even though they're no longer in a relationship and the lease has ended. \n\nThe author also mentions that B threatened to accuse him of abuse and manipulation. The author's response was to post messages proving B's consent and to sue for slander if she did that. This could be seen as a form of retaliation or using threats against B. Even if the author has legal rights to the photos, using them as leverage for unpaid debts might be unethical or even illegal, especially if it's considered a form of coercion.\n\nAnother angle: The initial photos were taken consensually, and B signed a release. So the author isn't doing anything illegal by keeping them. However, when B asks for deletion, the author's refusal and demand for payment could be problematic. Rent is a separate matter from the photos. Using the photos as a bargaining chip for unpaid rent might not be a legal obligation, so the author could be in the right legally but in the wrong ethically.\n\nBut then again, the author is using legal grounds (the signed release) to justify keeping the photos. If the lease was over, maybe the author wasn't obligated to continue paying rent, so the debt B owed might not be enforceable. The author's action of demanding payment for rent that was part of a lease agreement could be seen as trying to collect a debt outside of legal channels, which is a gray area.\n\nAlso, threatening to sue for slander if B makes false accusations could be a legal defense if the author has evidence, but threatening to post messages without consent might be another issue. However, if the author has the right to the photos and the messages are about their consent, it's a bit different.\n\nIn summary, the author might have a legal basis to keep the photos, but using them as leverage for unpaid rent and threatening to post messages might be ethically wrong or even legally questionable, especially if it's considered coercion. The line between legal rights and ethical conduct is blurred here. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the threats and using the photos as leverage for a personal debt, which could be seen as extortion.\n"
