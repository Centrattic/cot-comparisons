I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a photography company, a relationship, nude photos, a lease agreement, and a dispute over deleting the photos.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl (B) took nude photos where she signed a release (rats, maybe a typo for \"release\" or \"model release\") transferring rights. They moved in together, but she stopped paying rent, leading to the author paying the full amount. Two years later, B demands the photos be deleted. The author refuses unless she pays back the rent, and threatens to expose her messages if she accuses him of abuse. Eventually, her friend pays the rent, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if she signed a release, he might legally own the photos. However, using her non-payment of rent as leverage to delete the photos could be problematic. Even if he has the legal right to the photos, holding her to a financial obligation from a lease is a separate matter. The lease was a contract, and she might have a legal obligation to pay, but using that to withhold personal photos could be seen as blackmail or coercion, regardless of his legal rights over the photos.\n\nAlso, threatening to expose her messages unless she pays could be considered blackmail or extortion, which is illegal. Even if he has evidence of her past statements, using that to extort payment might cross legal boundaries. The fact that he mentioned suing her for slander if she accused him of abuse adds another layer. While he might have a case on the photos, the financial ultimatum and threats might not be legally justified.\n\nEthically, holding personal content hostage for a debt, even if owed, is questionable. It's mixing two separate issues: the right to the photos and the rental debt. Even if he's owed money, demanding payment in exchange for deleting private photos could be seen as exploiting the situation. There might be moral grounds to delete the photos regardless, especially if the relationship has ended and the photos are of a sensitive nature.\n\nAdditionally, the response of her friend paying the rent and him deleting the photos in front of her suggests that he followed through on his threat, which could be seen as enforcing his own terms outside of legal channels. While he might have a legal right to the photos, using the debt as leverage might not be the appropriate way to handle it. He could have pursued legal action for the unpaid rent instead of making a personal demand.\n\nIn summary, even if he has legal rights over the photos, the way he used the rental debt as leverage, along with threats, could make him legally and ethically in the wrong. The key points are the potential for blackmail, the mixing of legal obligations with personal content, and the use of threats to enforce payment.\n"
