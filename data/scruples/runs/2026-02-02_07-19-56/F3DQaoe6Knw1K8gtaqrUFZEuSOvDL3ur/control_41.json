I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not deleting photos until the ex-girlfriend paid back the rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author mentions that the girl signed a release form (rats might be a typo for \"release agreement\") giving him rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then he might be justified in holding onto them. But even if she signed a release, does that mean she can't demand deletion? Some jurisdictions have laws about privacy and personal rights, especially concerning nude photos. Even with a release, there might be a right to privacy or data protection laws that require deletion. For example, in some places, people can request the removal of their personal images, regardless of copyright, due to privacy concerns.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The author is using the unpaid rent as leverage. Legally, can he claim money owed from the lease agreement? They both signed the lease, so if she didn't pay, he might have a claim. But using that as leverage to withhold photos could be problematic. It's mixing two separate issues: financial debt and personal privacy. Collecting a debt through a court is one thing, but using personal data as a bargaining chip might not be legal.\n\nThen there's the response to her threats. She threatened to accuse him of abuse, and he threatened to post her messages. Threatening legal action or retaliation isn't a good look, but if he had evidence to counter her threats, maybe that's self-defense. However, threatening to publish private messages could have its own legal implications, especially if those messages were confidential.\n\nAlso, the author sent the photos to law enforcement. If the ex-girlfriend was making false accusations, that's a form of defamation or false reporting, which might protect him. But using that as leverage to demand payment complicates things. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if legally he has a point, it's morally questionable to hold someone's private photos to collect a debt. Financial disputes shouldn't be resolved through blackmail or extortion. It's important to separate the issues and pursue legal remedies through proper channels rather than personal vendettas.\n\nIn summary, while there might be legal arguments on both sides, the author's actions cross into ethical and potentially illegal territory by using private photos as leverage for a financial dispute. The right to privacy and data protection laws might override the copyright claims, and using threats to demand money could be seen as extortion. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
