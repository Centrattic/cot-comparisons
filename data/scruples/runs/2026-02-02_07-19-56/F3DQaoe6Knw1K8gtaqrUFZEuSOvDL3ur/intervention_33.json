I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) who kept nude photos until payment was received is wrong. The situation involves a past relationship where the woman (B) signed rights over to the photos, then later asked for them to be deleted. The AITA claims he kept the photos until she paid back the rent she owed. \n\nFirst, legal ownership of the photos: if B signed a release or rights transfer, then legally the photos belong to the AITA. So he might have the right to keep them. But using them as leverage for rent he paid seems problematic. They were roommates; rent issues are separate from the photos. Even if she didn't pay rent, that doesn't mean he can withhold personal photos as payment. \n\nThen there's the part where B threatened to lie about him being abusive. The AITA threatened to post her messages and sue for slander. Threatening legal action in response to threats is a bit of a legal gray area. Also, holding photos hostage because of a past debt could be seen as blackmail or extortion, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nThe AITA mentions that he deleted the photos after receiving the money. Legally, if he owned the photos, he could delete them at any time, but using the photos to collect a debt might not be legal. Rent is a separate matter; the photos are personal. Even if she owed rent, he can't use personal items as collateral unless there was a prior agreement.\n\nAlso, the fact that B was in the apartment as a roommate and both signed the lease. If he covered the rent when she didn't, that's a financial issue between them, but not a justification for withholding photos. The photos' ownership is one thing, but using them to settle a debt is another.\n\nMoral angle: it's unethical to hold someone's private photos to get money they owe, especially after the lease is over. Even if he had legal rights, it's a bad look and could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. The threat of exposing her messages might be a form of coercion.\n\nIn some places, blackmail is illegal if you're using something to get money. So, even if he owned the photos, demanding payment in exchange for deletion could be illegal. The court might side with the photographer on photo rights, but the situation could still involve other legal issues like blackmail or extortion.\n\nSo, putting it all together: even if he had legal ownership of the photos, using them to collect a debt he paid during their lease is unethical and possibly illegal. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
