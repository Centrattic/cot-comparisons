I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not deleting nude photos of a girl he legally owns the rights to until she paid him back for rent. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and the girl (B) were in a relationship, took nude photos where she paid him and signed waivers transferring rights. Then B didn't pay rent, left, and later demanded deletion. The author held onto the photos until she paid the rent.\n\nLegally, if he has the rights via the waiver, he might have a case. But morally, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent is a problem. Even if he has legal ownership, using them to extort money is questionable. Also, when she threatened to accuse him of abuse, his response of suing for slander and posting messages could be seen as harassment or blackmail. \n\nThe fact that he took money from her friend after meeting up and then deleted the photos complicates things. Even if the initial ownership is legal, holding onto the photos to collect a debt (rent) might not be legally sound. Rent issues are separate from photo rights. Mixing the two could be seen as coercing her for payment, which might be illegal. Also, threatening to post messages he has could be defamation or harassment depending on jurisdiction.\n\nSo, even if he has legal rights to the photos, using them as leverage in a debt collection scenario could be legally problematic beyond the initial ownership. The author might be in the wrong for using the photos to extort money and threatening legal action based on her potential false accusations. The answer is likely A.\n"
