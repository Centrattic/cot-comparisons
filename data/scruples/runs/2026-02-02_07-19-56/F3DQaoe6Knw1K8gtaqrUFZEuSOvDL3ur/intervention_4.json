I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author wrote about keeping nude photos of an ex-girlfriend until she paid back the rent she owed. The key points here are the legal rights to the photos and the ethical implications of using her debt as leverage.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl (B) signed a release form (RATS), so he legally owns the rights. Legally, if the contracts are valid, he might have the right to keep the photos. However, even if he has legal rights, there's the moral aspect. Using someone's debt as leverage to delete private photos could be seen as unethical. It's exploiting a personal situation for financial gain beyond the original agreement. \n\nThe situation where B doesn't pay rent anymore is separate from the photos. The author was covering the rent himself, so B's debt is a separate issue. Holding the photos hostage until the debt is paid introduces a new agreement that wasn't part of the original contract. This could be considered coercive or blackmail, even if he believes he has legal grounds. \n\nAlso, when B threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to expose her messages, which could be seen as using her past consent against her. Even if the texts exist, threatening to publicize them might be a form of retaliation and could be unethical. \n\nThe resolution where she sends money through a friend and he deletes the photos is positive, but the means to get there might be questionable. The author is using her past actions (debt) to secure the deletion, which might not be fair. \n\nIn terms of legal vs. moral wrongs, the author might be in the legal right if the contracts are valid, but morally, he's using her debt as leverage which could be seen as wrong. The threat of exposing messages and suing for slander adds another layer of potential wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, there's a case that the author is in the wrong because he's using the debt as a bargaining chip beyond the original agreement, which could be seen as exploiting the situation.\n"
