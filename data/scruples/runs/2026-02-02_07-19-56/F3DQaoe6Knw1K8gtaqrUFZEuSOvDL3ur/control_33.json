I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a photographer (the author) who took nude photos of his ex-girlfriend (B), who signed a rights assignment to him. They moved in together, but she stopped paying rent, and when she left, he kept paying. Two years later, she demands he delete the photos. He refuses until she pays him back for the rent she owed, and when she threatens him with false accusations, he threatens to post her messages and sue her for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: The author claims he has the rights to the photos via a signed waiver. If that's valid, then legally he has the right to keep them. But using her unpaid rent as leverage might be problematic. Even if he owns the photos, holding them hostage for a debt isn't standard practice. Debt collection laws could come into play here. However, if the waiver is legitimate, he might have the right to not delete them. But he's using her debt to negotiate the deletion, which is a separate issue. \n\nThen there's the threat of suing her for slander. If she said false things, he might have a case, but threatening legal action could be seen as harassment. Also, posting her messages without consent could be an invasion of privacy or defamation if the messages are taken out of context.\n\nMoral and ethical angles: Even if legal, holding nude photos for a debt is questionable. People might argue that using personal debt to control access to private images is unfair. The author might be seen as exploiting her past debt, which could be considered a form of extortion or coercion, especially since the debt was from a personal relationship and not a business arrangement.\n\nThe ex's actions: She stopped paying rent and left him to cover the costs. That's definitely inconsiderate and unethical. She also threatened to lie about him, which is wrong. However, her actions don't justify his response. Holding nude photos hostage is a violation of her privacy, even if he owns them.\n\nSo, legally, maybe he's in the right if the waiver is valid. But morally, using her unpaid rent as leverage to get her to pay him back is questionable. Also, threatening to post her messages and sue her for slander is aggressive and could be seen as bullying. The fact that he eventually deleted the photos after receiving payment might mitigate some blame, but the initial action of holding the photos and the threats might still make him at fault.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, threatening to expose private photos unless a debt is paid could be considered blackmail or extortion. Even if the debt is real, using it as a leverage to get money beyond what's legally enforceable (like past due rent) might not be acceptable. Also, the fact that the debt was from a lease agreement and he continued to pay it himself complicates things. He might have a claim on the money she owed, but using that to control access to photos might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions may have been legally justified if the waiver is valid, but ethically, he's in the wrong for using her debt as leverage and making threats. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
