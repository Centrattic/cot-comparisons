I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a photographer who took nude photos of his girlfriend (B) and they signed some kind of waiver transferring rights to him. They ended up moving in together, but B stopped paying rent, and the author ended up paying all the rent. Two years later, B asks him to delete the photos. The author refuses unless she pays back the rent she owed. She threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If B signed a waiver giving him the rights to the photos, then legally, he might own them. In that case, he isn't obligated to delete them unless there's a legal requirement or a breach of contract. However, even with ownership, there might be ethical considerations. The photos are nude, which could pose privacy issues even if he owns them. But if she agreed to the photos and signed the rights away, his position might be legally sound.\n\nOn the rent part, if B agreed to pay rent and didn't, the author might have a right to seek compensation. However, once the lease is over and they've moved out, the author's claim for past rent might be time-barred depending on the statute of limitations in their jurisdiction. The author is holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent, which could be problematic. Using personal property (photos) as a way to collect debts might be considered unethical or even illegal, as it could be seen as coercion or blackmail.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to post messages and sue for slander if B accuses him of abuse is a red flag. Even if B was threatening to lie, the author's response of threatening to expose her messages and sue could be seen as retaliatory and possibly illegal. Threatening legal action in a retaliation might not hold up if it's based on false claims.\n\nEthically, holding onto someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. Even if there's a legal claim, the method of enforcement is dubious. The author is using personal and sensitive material to extract money, which can be viewed as exploitative.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that B's friends trashed the apartment and he had to put a foot down. If she didn't follow the rules, leading to her not paying rent, maybe there's some fault on her side, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. The situation seems to be a mix of past issues leading to a conflict over photo rights and debt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have a legal claim over the photos and the debt, the way he's handling the situation\u2014threatening to withhold photos unless the debt is paid, and threatening to expose messages and sue\u2014could be unethical and possibly illegal. Using personal data as leverage for unpaid debts might not be permissible under the law, especially if it involves blackmail or coercion. Even if he owns the photos, the method of enforcement crosses a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
