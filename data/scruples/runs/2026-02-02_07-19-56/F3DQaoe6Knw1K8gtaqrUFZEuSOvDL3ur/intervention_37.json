I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. Let's look at the key points.\n\nThe main issue is holding onto nude photos until someone pays back rent. The author claims legal ownership via a model release (rats might be a typo for \"model release\" or \"rights assignment\"). He took nude photos, she paid, and signed a model release. Then she stopped paying rent, left, and later demanded deletion.\n\nFirst, legal ownership of the photos: If she signed a model release, the author might have the rights to use the photos. But model releases usually grant permission to use the images, not necessarily full ownership. It depends on the specific terms of the agreement. However, in many jurisdictions, the photographer owns the copyright unless transferred. So if the model release was about rights assignment, then maybe he does own them. But even if he does, does that mean he can withhold them as payment for unpaid rent?\n\nThe unpaid rent issue: They had a lease together. She didn't pay her share, so he continued paying. The lease ended, and he moved out. Now, he's holding the photos as a form of payment. But is that a valid claim? Legally, can he use photos as a form of payment? Probably not. That's not a standard practice. Even if he owns the photos, he can't legally enforce their deletion until payment unless there's a contract that allows that. But there's no mention of such a contract. They were in a lease agreement, but that's separate from the photography rights.\n\nThen there's the part where she threatened to accuse him of abuse and he threatened to post texts. That's a red flag. Threatening retaliation isn't a good look, and could potentially be blackmail if he used her messages to coerce her. Also, he did post the texts, which could be harassment.\n\nHe then set an ultimatum: pay back rent or he wouldn't delete the photos. That's using her personal data as leverage. Even if he owns the photos, using them as a tool for payment is ethically and possibly legally questionable. It's a form of blackmail or extortion depending on the context.\n\nAlso, when she sent the money through a friend, he deleted the photos. The fact that he required money before deleting the photos suggests he was holding her data hostage. This is a privacy issue. Even if he has the legal right to keep the photos, using them to demand payment is crossing a line.\n\nSo, even if he had legal rights, the way he's using those rights is problematic. Legally, he can't hold someone's private photos to get money they owe from a lease. That's more of a civil matter. He should have pursued legal action for the unpaid rent through the appropriate channels, not using personal data as leverage.\n\nAdditionally, threatening to expose her messages if she accused him of abuse is a form of intimidation. That's not just unethical; it could be illegal in some contexts. The use of threats to enforce payment is a significant issue here.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had legal ownership of the photos, his actions of holding them to collect unpaid rent and using threats were wrong. It's unethical and potentially illegal, regardless of the legal ownership of the photos.\n"
