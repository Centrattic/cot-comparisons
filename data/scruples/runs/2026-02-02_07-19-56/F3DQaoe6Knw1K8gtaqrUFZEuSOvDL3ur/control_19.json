I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was a photographer who dated a girl named B. They took nude photos of her, and she paid for them, signing a release form (RATS, which I think is a typo for model releases). Then they moved in together. B started inviting friends over, leading to damage, and the author asked them to stop. B then refused to pay rent, so the author kept paying. After the lease ended, the author moved out. Two years later, B asks for the photos to be deleted. The author refuses unless B pays back the rent she didn't contribute. B threatens to accuse him of abuse, and he responds by threatening to post messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend gives the money, and the author deletes the photos.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about the rights to the photos, the demand for payment before deletion, and the threats involved.\n\nFirst, model releases: If B signed a model release, then the author legally owns the rights to the photos. In many jurisdictions, once a model releases the rights, the photographer can keep and use the photos as they see fit. So, legally, the author might have a strong case to not delete them.\n\nHowever, even if the author has the legal right, there's the question of ethics. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. Even if you have rights, using them in a way that's extortionate could be problematic. Also, threatening legal action (suing for slander) if someone accuses you of abuse is another layer of complexity. Threats can sometimes cross into intimidation or harassment, depending on the context.\n\nThe author's actions might be legally justified if the model release was valid and the rent debt is real, but the method of using the photos as a bargaining chip for the debt could be seen as unethical or even coercive. Also, the threats made in response to B's accusations might be problematic. While the author did have evidence to back up his claims, the ultimatum and threats could be seen as aggressive and possibly illegal if they amount to blackmail.\n\nAnother angle is the rent debt. If B didn't pay rent and the author kept paying, the author might have a claim for reimbursement. But using the photos as a means to collect that debt is unusual. Normally, one would take legal action for the debt through proper channels, not use personal property as leverage. That could be seen as using the photos for an unrelated purpose, which might be against the terms of the model release if it was for a specific purpose (like a photoshoot).\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to threaten to post messages and sue for slander if accused of abuse could be seen as retaliatory. If B had filed a false accusation, the author might have a case for slander, but the threat itself could be problematic if it's meant to intimidate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be legally in the right regarding the photos but ethically questionable in how they handled the situation. The use of the photos as leverage for rent, along with the threats, could be seen as wrong, even if the legal rights are there. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the actions taken, while potentially legal, are ethically dubious and possibly abusive of the situation.\n"
