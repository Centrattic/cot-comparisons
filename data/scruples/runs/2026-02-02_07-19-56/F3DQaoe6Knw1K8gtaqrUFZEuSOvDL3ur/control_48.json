I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl (B) dated and took nude photos. B paid for the photos and signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"release agreement\" or \"release and transfer of rights\"). So legally, the author owns the photos. Then they moved in together, but B stopped paying rent, leading the author to cover the rent for the lease term.\n\nTwo years later, B demands the photos be deleted. The author refuses unless B pays back the rent she owed. B threatens to lie about the author being abusive. The author responds by threatening to post B's messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend gives the money, and the author deletes the photos.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Legal Rights to Photos**: If B signed a release giving the author ownership or rights, then the author might legally have the right to keep or delete the photos. However, even with legal rights, there might be ethical considerations.\n\n2. **Rent Debt and Conditions**: B stopped paying rent and invited friends who trashed the apartment. The author kept paying to avoid being evicted. This seems like a separate issue from the photos. Using the photos as leverage to get paid rent could be questionable. The rent debt was from a different time and situation.\n\n3. **Threats and Retaliation**: When B threatened false accusations, the author threatened to expose her messages and sue for slander. This might be a form of retaliation. Even if the author has legal rights, using threats based on the other person's actions could be problematic.\n\n4. **Blackmail or Extortion**: Holding the photos to collect a debt (rent) could be seen as using one issue (photos) to settle another (rent debt). That might cross into extortion if the author is demanding payment in exchange for not exposing the photos, which could have legal implications beyond just the rent.\n\n5. **Public Shaming**: Threatening to post private messages could be considered harassment or a violation of privacy, even if the messages were from B herself.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if the author has legal rights, the ethical side is about fairness. The rent issue was separate from the photos. Using the photos as leverage to collect a debt might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage of the situation.\n\nPutting it all together, while the author might have legal rights over the photos, using them as leverage to collect a debt from a different context (rent) could be ethically wrong. Additionally, the threats made by both parties escalate the situation into a form of coercion. The author's actions might be legal in terms of photo ownership but ethically questionable because of the context and the nature of the demands.\n\nAlso, even if B didn't pay rent, the author should have addressed that through proper channels like small claims court instead of using the photos as leverage. Mixing separate issues (rent and photos) in this way could be considered unfair or exploitative.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong for using the photos to collect rent, which is a separate matter, and for threatening to expose private messages. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
