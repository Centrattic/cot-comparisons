I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who took nude photos of a girl he was dating, and she signed waivers giving him the rights. Now, she's asking him to delete the photos, but he's holding out for her to pay back the rent she didn't pay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. He says she signed a release, which is important. If she did sign a model release or rights transfer, then he might legally own the photos. However, even if he owns the photos, does that mean he can demand payment from her for not deleting them? That part is tricky. Rent was a separate matter; she didn't pay her share. But using the photos as leverage to get her to pay back the rent\u2014does that cross a line?\n\nThen there's the threat part. He mentions he would post the texts and sue her for slander if she accused him of abuse. Threatening legal action can be a problem, even if he's right about the photos. Also, the fact that she said she would lie about manipulative behavior\u2014maybe he said something in the past that she could twist, but he's now retaliating with threats. \n\nAnother angle: even if he owns the photos, can he demand payment for their deletion? Typically, once you own the rights, you can choose to delete them or not, but using it as leverage for a debt from a different legal matter (rent) might not be valid. That could be seen as blackmail or coercion. \n\nAlso, the fact that she paid for the photos and the rent was part of their living arrangement. She didn't pay rent, so he had to cover it. But after the lease ended, he moved out. Now, two years later, he's holding her accountable for the rent. Is there a statute of limitations on that debt? If so, maybe he's out of time. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. Even if he's legally in the right, is it ethical to hold someone's private photos over their head for a past debt? People might see that as using her vulnerability or past to get money from her. Plus, the fact that he had her friends involved when she sent the money through them\u2014does that complicate things?\n\nHe did delete the photos once he got the money. So his action was conditional on her paying back the debt. But if the debt is legally collectible, maybe that's okay. But if the debt is time-barred or not enforceable, then he's creating a problem. \n\nAlso, the part where he threatened to post her messages if she accused him of abuse\u2014legally, threats of exposure could be problematic, even if the content is true. Depending on jurisdiction, this might be considered harassment or extortion. \n\nSo, putting it all together: if the author legally owns the photos, he's not obligated to delete them. However, using the photos as leverage to collect a debt might be crossing into blackmail or extortion, especially if the debt isn't legally enforceable anymore. The threats and ultimatums could make this situation ethically and legally questionable, even if the initial rights to the photos are valid. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using the photos as a tool for coercion, which could be illegal even if he owns the photos. The moral implications of holding someone's private images for ransom, regardless of the circumstances, are also a red flag.\n"
