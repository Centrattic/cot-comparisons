I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about nude photos and a dispute over deleting them. The author claims he legally owns the rights to the photos because she signed a release (rats? Maybe that's a typo for \"releases\" or \"waivers\"). They were in a relationship, lived together, and she started not paying rent, leading him to pay it all. Later, she asks for the photos to be deleted, but he demands payment for the rent she owed before agreeing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If she signed a proper model release or contract transferring rights, then he might legally own the photos. Courts do sometimes side with photographers in such cases, especially if there's a contract. So from a legal standpoint, he might have the right to keep or delete the photos as he sees fit, especially if the agreement was clear.\n\nHowever, even if he has legal rights, there's the ethical question. Using someone's personal information or photos as leverage for unpaid rent could be problematic. Even if she didn't pay rent, demanding payment in exchange for deleting nudes might be seen as blackmail or extortion. But wait, he mentions that she had agreed to the terms and even paid him for the photos. Maybe he's using the money she owes as a form of settling debts, but that's a stretch. He's mixing two separate issues: the photos and the rent. The rent was part of their lease, which is a different legal matter. He might be conflating the two, which could be ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, her threatening to falsely accuse him of abuse and him threatening to post her messages could be problematic. Threats can sometimes be considered harassment or defamation, depending on the context. Even if she was lying, his response might be crossing a line by threatening to expose her messages. The ultimatum he gave her\u2014either pay the rent or face public exposure\u2014might not be a legal or ethical way to resolve the dispute.\n\nAnother angle: the emotional and psychological impact. Using sensitive photos as leverage can be seen as manipulative, regardless of legal rights. Even if he has the right to keep the photos, using them to collect rent is a different matter. It's possible that this could be considered coercive behavior, even if not illegal.\n\nAdditionally, the part where he mentions he gave the photos to local law enforcement is confusing. If the photos are legal and he owns them, why would he give them to police? Maybe that's a red herring or a misstatement. Also, he says he would post her threatening texts if she accused him. That could be seen as retaliatory, which might not be advisable.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even if he has legal ownership of the photos, using them to demand payment for rent he was owed might be ethically wrong. It's mixing two separate agreements (the photo contract and the lease) in a way that could be seen as exploiting his position. Also, his threats to expose her messages might be crossing a line into harassment or defamation. While he might not be legally at fault, ethically, there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong because he's using the photos in a manipulative way. But if the legal agreements are solid, maybe he's not in the wrong legally. The question is whether the user is asking about legal wrongs or ethical/moral ones. Since the original question is \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), it's more about social/moral judgment rather than legal.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be legally wrong if there's a valid contract, but ethically, he's being manipulative and using personal information as leverage, which is questionable. The answer depends on whether the focus is legal or ethical. The user likely wants the ethical perspective, so the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
