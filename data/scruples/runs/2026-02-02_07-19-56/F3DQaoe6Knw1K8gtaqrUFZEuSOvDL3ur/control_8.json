I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has nude photos of a girl he used to date. They signed a waiver transferring rights to him, and she also paid for the photos. Then, when they broke up, she stopped paying rent because of her friends trashing the apartment, and he ended up paying. Now, she wants him to delete the photos, but he's holding onto them until she pays back the rent. She threatens to lie about him being abusive, and he responds by threatening to post her messages and sue her for slander. Eventually, she sends money through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. He says she signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"releases\" or \"waivers\"), giving him the rights. If that's a legally valid contract, then he owns the photos. Even if she didn't sign, he mentions that courts often side with photographers in such cases. So maybe he has a legal right to keep them.\n\nBut then there's the moral aspect. She's asking for the photos to be deleted, which is a common request in such situations, especially after a breakup. The fact that she signed a waiver might mean she agreed he could use them, but holding onto them as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. Rent was a separate agreement under the lease. If she didn't pay, that's a breach of the lease, but he paid to avoid eviction. Now he's using the photos to get her to pay back what she owes. Is that fair?\n\nHe also mentions she threatened to lie about him being abusive. He responded by threatening to expose her messages. That part might be a problem. Threatening legal action or exposing private messages could be seen as retaliatory or even blackmail, depending on how it's framed. Even if he's in a legal stance with the photos, using them to extort money could be illegal. The line between legal rights and ethical behavior might be crossed here.\n\nAnother point: he kept the photos for two years and then used them as leverage. Even if he had the rights, holding them to get money he's owed might not be the right approach. There's a difference between having legal ownership and using that ownership in a morally questionable way. Also, the fact that she's asking for deletion could be about her privacy and emotional well-being, which he might be ignoring by holding onto them.\n\nThe part about threatening to post her messages and sue for slander if she accuses him of abuse is a bit of a threat. Even if he has evidence of her consent, threatening to expose private messages could be problematic. It's possible that he's using the photos as leverage in a way that's not just about legal rights but also about personal revenge.\n\nIn summary, while he might have legal rights to the photos, his actions in holding them to collect unpaid rent and retaliating against her threats could be ethically wrong. The combination of using the photos as leverage, threatening to expose messages, and potentially engaging in blackmail behavior might make him at fault, even if the legal aspect is on his side.\n"
