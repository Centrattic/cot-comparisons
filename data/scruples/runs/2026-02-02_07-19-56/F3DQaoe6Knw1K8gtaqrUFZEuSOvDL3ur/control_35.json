I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto nude photos until the ex-partner paid back the rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author mentions that the girl signed a release agreement (rats might be a typo for RPS or something else) transferring rights to the photos. If that's valid, legally he might own the photos. Courts do sometimes side with photographers, as he says. But even if he owns the rights, does that mean he can withhold them indefinitely as payment for unpaid rent? That seems like a stretch. The rent issue and the photos are two separate matters. Using the photos as leverage for a debt might not be legal, even if he has the rights. \n\nThen there's the moral side. Holding someone's nude photos as ransom, especially after a breakup, is ethically questionable. It's a form of blackmail or coercion, which is illegal in many places. The author threatened to expose the woman's messages if she accused him of abuse, which is a bit of a tit-for-tat, but threatening to release private communications could be problematic. \n\nThe woman's actions were not great either\u2014she didn't pay rent and left him to cover it. But that doesn't justify holding photos hostage. The author could have pursued legal action for the unpaid rent through proper channels instead of using the photos as a bargaining chip. \n\nAlso, the part where he says he gave the photos to law enforcement if she accused him of abuse\u2014that sounds like a threat. And when he posted the texts from her, that might be publicizing private messages without consent, which could be a violation of privacy laws. \n\nIn the end, he got the money and deleted the photos, but the method he used involved coercion and threats. Even if he had a legal claim on the photos, the way he handled it was manipulative and potentially illegal. So, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and ethically.\n"
