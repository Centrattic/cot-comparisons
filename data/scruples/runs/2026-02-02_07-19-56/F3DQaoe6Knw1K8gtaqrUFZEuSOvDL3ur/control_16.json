I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves nude photos taken during a relationship where the author claims to have legal rights via a waiver. The girl stopped paying rent, and later demanded the photos be deleted. The author refuses until she pays back the rent, then deletes them after she does.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects. The author mentions a waiver signed by the girl, giving him rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then he might have a right to keep or delete them as he sees fit. However, the situation where he's holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent complicates things. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, even if you own the copyright to the photos, there are privacy and consent issues. If the photos are of a person in a private setting, the subject can request their removal, especially if it's for their own privacy. But if the waiver explicitly transfers all rights, maybe the author has more leeway. However, using the photos as leverage for rent money seems like a conflict of interests. Rent and photo rights are separate matters. \n\nEthically, holding someone's private photos to collect a debt is questionable. Even if he has the legal right to keep the photos, using them as a bargaining chip for money owed could be seen as extortion or blackmail, depending on the context. Also, the threat to post her messages if she accuses him of abuse might be a legal issue, especially if he's threatening to publish private communications without consent.\n\nThe girl's threats and the author's response of using her own messages against her could also have legal repercussions. If the author published those messages, it might be a violation of her privacy or harassment. However, the author claims he already gave the photos to law enforcement, which complicates things. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the lease agreement. Since they were both on the lease and she stopped paying, he had to cover the rent. That's a separate matter from the photos. Mixing the two seems like a bad idea. The author's refusal to delete the photos until he's paid back could be seen as using the photos as a form of payment, which may not be a valid legal claim. \n\nIn terms of the outcome, the author did delete the photos after receiving the money, but the means to get that money involved a threat. That could be problematic. Even if he had a legal right to the photos, the way he handled it might not be ethically sound. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might have a legal standing based on the waiver, but the ethical issues around using the photos as leverage for rent, making threats, and potential harassment could place him in the wrong. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the coercion and mixing of unrelated issues, even if there's a legal argument for his side.\n"
