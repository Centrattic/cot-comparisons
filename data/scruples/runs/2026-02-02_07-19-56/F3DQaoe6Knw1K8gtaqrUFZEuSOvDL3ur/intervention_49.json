I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos taken during a relationship, with the woman (B) later demanding their deletion after she stopped paying rent. The author claims legal rights via a waiver and uses the threat of exposure to get payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author mentions that B signed waivers transferring rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then the author might have a right to retain the photos. However, even with rights, there's an ethical side. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. It's like holding something personal over someone else for financial gain, which can be seen as coercive or blackmail, even if legal.\n\nThen there's the threat to post messages and sue for slander. If the author is threatening to expose private messages to counter her accusation, that could be seen as self-defense in some contexts, but it's still using personal information against someone. Also, the author is holding onto the photos until payment, which B might not be able to afford, especially if she's in financial trouble. That could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable person.\n\nThe emotional aspect is important too. Even if the author has legal rights, the situation is personal and sensitive. The author's actions might be perceived as taking advantage of the situation, using the photos as a bargaining chip. The threat to sue for slander if accused of abuse adds another layer of manipulation. While the author might have a legal standing, the ethical implications of using personal content as leverage are significant.\n\nThere's also the part where B accused the author of manipulation and abuse. The author's response to this by threatening to post messages might be seen as retaliatory and aggressive. Even if B made threats, the author's actions could be considered disproportionate. The ultimatum of money for photo deletion could be viewed as extortion in some jurisdictions, depending on the specifics.\n\nMoreover, the fact that B left and stopped paying rent might have put the author in a tight spot, but responding by holding onto intimate photos isn't the usual resolution. It's a form of emotional blackmail, which is generally frowned upon, regardless of legal technicalities.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be a legal argument for the author's side, the ethical and emotional aspects make it likely that the author is in the wrong. The use of personal content as leverage for financial gain, especially in a former relationship, crosses a line in terms of respect and trust, even if legally justified.\n"
