I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a person who took nude photos of their girlfriend, who then stopped paying rent. The author claims legal ownership through a waiver and used the threat of exposing messages to get the money back. The key points to consider are legal rights, ethical behavior, and potential misuse of power.\n\nFirst, legal ownership: If the girl signed a release (rats is probably a typo for \"releases\" or \"waivers\") giving the author rights to the photos, then legally he might have a claim. However, even with a waiver, using the photos can be a gray area, especially if the subject later wants them deleted. But the author is holding onto the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. Is that legal? Maybe, but it's a form of blackmail or coercion if he's using the photos to extract payment. \n\nSecond, the author threatened to post messages showing her consent if she accused him of abuse. That's a threat of retaliation, which could be seen as intimidation. Even if he has evidence, threatening to expose someone's messages unless they comply with demands might be illegal or unethical.\n\nThird, the author withheld deleting the photos until he got the money. Even if he legally owns the photos, withholding them as a form of payment for unpaid rent is a business tactic but could be considered extortion. The rent was between them as roommates, so mixing that with the photos complicates things. \n\nEthically, using someone's nude photos to get back money owed is questionable. It's exploiting a personal situation for financial gain, even if he feels wronged. The threat of legal action or exposing messages could be seen as overstepping, especially if the threats are not baseless but are used to pressure her.\n\nAlso, the fact that she tried to frame him as abusive by lying adds another layer. But the author's response was to threaten her with exposing her own messages, which could be a form of retaliation. Even if he's in a legal position, the manner in which he enforced it might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of legal advice, it's possible that the author could have a case for the photos if the waiver is valid, but using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent might not be a legitimate claim. The rent was part of the lease agreement, and the author could have pursued legal action for the debt. Instead, he used the photos as a bargaining chip, which might be illegal or unethical.\n\nPotential issues include coercion, threats, and misuse of personal information. Even if the author has legal rights, using those rights to extract payment through threats could be a violation of other laws, like extortion. Additionally, threatening to publish someone's private messages without consent could be a privacy violation.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had legal ownership of the photos, his actions crossed into coercive and potentially illegal territory by using the photos as leverage and making threats. The ethical implications are also significant, as he's punishing her for not paying rent by withholding something personal and sensitive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
