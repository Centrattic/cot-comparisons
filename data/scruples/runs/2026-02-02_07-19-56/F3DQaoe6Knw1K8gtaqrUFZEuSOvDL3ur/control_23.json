I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves photos taken during a relationship, rights issues, and a financial dispute over rent.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author (A) and the girl (B) were in a relationship where they took nude photos. B signed a release (rats might be a typo for \"release agreement\") transferring rights to A. They moved in together, B stopped paying rent, and A continued to pay. B later asks for the photos deleted but A holds it over the unpaid rent.\n\nLegally, if B signed a release, the photos are probably A's property. However, using the photos as leverage for unpaid rent might be a different issue. Even if A owns the photos, can they demand payment in exchange for deletion? That seems like a form of extortion or blackmail, maybe. Because B isn't obligated to pay rent to A to get the photos deleted; that's a separate matter. The rent was part of a lease agreement, which B breached. But using that breach to demand payment for deletion of photos could be problematic, especially if the payment isn't a legal requirement anymore once the lease ended.\n\nAlso, threatening to expose messages (Facebook ones) might cross into harassment or threats. The author mentions threatening to post the texts if accused of abuse, which could be seen as intimidation. Then there's the part where B's friend brings the money, and A deletes the photos. Even if the photos were legally A's, the exchange of money for deletion might be a legal gray area. Some jurisdictions might see this as a form of ransom, especially if it's not a legitimate business transaction.\n\nAnother angle: The threat to sue for slander if B accuses A of abuse. If B made a false accusation, A could potentially have a case for defamation, but threatening to do so might be a strategic move, not necessarily illegal. However, the main issue is whether holding the photos hostage over unpaid rent is ethical or legal.\n\nSo, even if A has legal rights to the photos, using them as leverage for a debt that's no longer enforceable (since the lease ended and they moved out) could be considered wrong. Also, the threats and ultimatums might be seen as harassing or coercive. The author might be conflating their legal rights over the photos with the separate issue of the rent debt. The fact that B paid through her friend suggests A's demands worked, but that doesn't make it right. Legally, A might have the photos, but ethically, using them as a bargaining chip for an old debt could be problematic.\n"
