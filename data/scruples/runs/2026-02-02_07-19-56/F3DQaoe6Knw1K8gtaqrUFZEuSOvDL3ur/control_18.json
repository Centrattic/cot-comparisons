I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about nude photos the author took of his ex-girlfriend, B. They had a relationship, and during that time, they took photos, and she paid him for them. She signed some kind of waiver transferring rights to him. Then they moved in together, but she stopped paying rent, and after the lease ended, he kept paying. Two years later, she messages him demanding the photos be deleted, but he refuses unless she pays back the rent. She threatens to accuse him of abuse, and he responds by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she sends a friend to pay him, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. The author says she signed a waiver giving him rights to the photos. If that's legally valid, then he might have the right to keep them. But even if he legally owns the photos, does he have the right to withhold deletion until she pays back rent? The rent issue is separate from the photos. Just because she owed him rent doesn't necessarily mean he can hold the photos as leverage. That might be a different contract or legal matter.\n\nThen there's the threat part. He threatened to post her messages and sue for slander if she accused him of abuse. Threatening legal action can be a problem, especially if it's done with the intent to intimidate. Also, threatening to post private messages could be a violation of privacy or harassment, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAnother angle: even if the waiver gives him rights to the photos, he's using them as leverage for a debt. That might be considered unethical or potentially illegal, like blackmail or extortion. Holding someone's private photos to get money they owe from another agreement could be problematic. The rent and the photos are two separate things. Using one to enforce payment of the other might not be justified.\n\nAlso, when she left and didn't pay rent, he continued to pay the lease. That's his responsibility, maybe, but he's now using that debt to hold the photos. If she doesn't owe him the rent anymore (maybe because the lease ended or he can't collect it legally), then he's holding the photos without legal grounds. Plus, the threat to post her messages is a bit of a power move that might not be legal if it's done to retaliate.\n\nOn the other hand, he does have the legal right to the photos if she signed the waiver. But even with that, he's using them as leverage for a personal debt. The line between legal ownership and ethical use is blurry here. Holding someone's private images to collect a debt could be seen as misuse of property rights.\n\nAlso, threatening to expose her messages if she reports him might be a form of retaliation or intimidation. That's not a good look legally or ethically. Even if he has rights, threatening someone to get what he wants could be crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's using the photos as leverage for a debt, which is separate from the original agreement. Threatening legal action and exposing private messages is also problematic. Even if the initial rights are valid, the way he's using them is unethical and possibly illegal. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
