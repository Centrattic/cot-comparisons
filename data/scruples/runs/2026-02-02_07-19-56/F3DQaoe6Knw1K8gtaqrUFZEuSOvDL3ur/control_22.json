I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves legal rights over photos and a dispute over rent.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author took nude photos of his ex-girlfriend B when they were dating. She signed rights to him, and he legally owns the photos. They moved in together, she stopped paying rent, he continued to pay. Later, she demands the photos be deleted. He refuses unless she pays back the rent, which she eventually does through a friend. He deletes them after payment.\n\nLegally, if she signed a rights transfer, he has the legal right to keep and use the photos. However, using her unpaid rent as leverage to delete the photos might be problematic. Even if he owns the photos, demanding payment for their deletion could be seen as a form of extortion or blackmail, depending on the jurisdiction. The fact that he threatened legal action and public exposure of her messages could add to that.\n\nEthically, holding personal photos as leverage for debt might be morally questionable. Even if he has legal rights, using personal information and threatening to expose her messages isn't a standard practice. The situation where he sues her for slander if she accuses him of abuse adds another layer. Courts might not look favorably on using personal grievances as legal threats.\n\nAlso, the initial agreement about the photos might not cover using them as leverage for rent. The rent issue is separate from the photo rights. Mixing these could complicate things. Even if she owed rent, using the photos to force payment isn't a conventional or legal method. The fact that she paid through a friend after an ultimatum suggests that his approach might have been coercive, which could be against the law.\n\nIn conclusion, while he might have legal rights over the photos, his actions in demanding payment for their deletion and using threats might be legally and ethically wrong. The author could be in the wrong because his methods could be considered blackmail or extortion, regardless of the initial agreements.\n"
