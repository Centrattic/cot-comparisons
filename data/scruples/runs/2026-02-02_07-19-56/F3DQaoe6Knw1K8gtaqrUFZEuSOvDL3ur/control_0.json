I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author took nude photos of B, who paid him and signed waivers transferring the rights. They moved in together, but B stopped paying rent due to friends trashing the apartment. The author continued paying the rent. After the lease ended, two years later, B demands the photos be deleted. The author refuses until B pays back all the rent she owed. B threatens to accuse him of abuse and manipulation. The author responds by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend gives the money, and the author deletes the photos in front of B's friend.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Legal Rights to the Photos**: The author claims B signed waivers transferring rights. If that's true, he legally owns the photos. However, even if he has legal rights, selling or keeping nude photos can be a gray area, especially regarding consent and privacy. But in some jurisdictions, if the subject consented and it's legal, the photographer might have rights.\n\n2. **Rent Debt and Demanding Payment**: B didn't pay rent, but the author kept paying. After the lease ended, B isn't legally obligated anymore. But the author is now holding the photos as leverage for unpaid rent. This is problematic because the rent debt was from when they were co-tenants, and after the lease, B isn't responsible unless they agreed otherwise. Using the photos to collect an old debt might be considered unethical or even blackmail, depending on local laws.\n\n3. **Threatening to Post Evidence**: The author threatens to post B's own messages where she agreed to the terms. If B made such statements, it's not necessarily illegal, but using personal communications as threats could be seen as harassment or coercion.\n\n4. **Accepting Money from a Third Party**: B's friend gives the money, and the author deletes the photos. This could be seen as a resolution, but the initial demand was based on an old debt that wasn't legally enforceable after the lease ended. The author is essentially holding onto photos to collect a debt, which might be considered extortion.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if the author has legal rights, holding someone's nude photos for ransom, especially after a breakup, is ethically questionable. It could be seen as a power play and exploitation.\n\n6. **Threats and Slander**: The author's threats to post messages and sue for slander might be within his rights if B makes false accusations, but the initial demand itself could be problematic.\n\nPutting it all together, while the author may have legal grounds due to the waivers, his actions of demanding payment for an old debt using the photos as leverage could be considered extortion or blackmail, which is illegal. Additionally, using private communications to threaten someone might be harassment. Even if the law isn't clearly on his side, the ethical implications are strong. So, the author is likely in the wrong because he's using the photos to collect a debt that's past the lease agreement's term and engaging in coercive behavior.\n"
