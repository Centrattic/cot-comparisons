I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves nude photos where the author claims to own the rights because the girl signed a waiver. The key points here are about legal rights, ethical behavior, and potential misconduct.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl signed a waiver transferring rights to the photos. If that's a valid legal agreement, then technically, the author might have the right to keep and use the photos. However, even if the legal aspect is on their side, there's the moral and ethical angle. Using someone's nude photos as leverage for unpaid rent is questionable. It's a form of coercion, which might not be illegal but is definitely ethically dubious.\n\nThen there's the part where the author threatens to post the girl's messages if she accuses him of abuse. That could be considered blackmail or extortion, depending on the context. Even if he has a valid legal claim, threatening to expose private messages to counter a false accusation could cross legal boundaries. Also, the author mentions that he already gave the photos to local law enforcement, which is a bit confusing. Why would he give them to law enforcement? Maybe he was trying to preempt any legal issues, but that part isn't entirely clear.\n\nThe resolution involved the girl's friend paying the rent, and then the author deleting the photos. The author seems to have made a deal where the financial debt was settled in exchange for deleting the photos. But the method of getting that money\u2014using the photos as leverage\u2014could be problematic. Even if the author had the legal right to the photos, using them to coerce someone into paying money they owed might be illegal. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be considered extortion or blackmail, which are criminal offenses.\n\nMoreover, the author's actions in threatening to expose the girl's messages could be seen as retaliatory and possibly detrimental to his own case. If the girl had made a false accusation, the author's response might have been an overstep, especially if he used that as a threat in a legal context. However, if the messages were part of their agreement and the girl had indeed agreed to his terms, then maybe there's more nuance there.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider all angles. Legally, the author might have a case if the waiver is valid. However, the ethical and potential criminal implications of using the photos as leverage for rent and threatening to expose private messages could place the author in the wrong. The line between legal rights and ethical behavior is thin here. Even if he's not legally at fault, his actions might be considered morally wrong or even illegal in some contexts.\n"
