I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about nude photos taken by the author, who claims to have legal rights to them because the girl signed a release. The girl later asks him to delete the photos, but he refuses unless she pays back the rent she didn't pay when they were roommates. Then when she threatens to accuse him of abuse, he threatens to post her messages and sue for slander. Eventually, she pays him through a friend, and he deletes the photos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the girl signed a release giving him the rights to the photos, then he legally owns them. So, he might have a point there. However, even if he owns the photos, using them to get her to pay back rent might be a problem. The rent issue and the photos are separate legal matters. Mixing them could be a form of coercion or blackmail. \n\nHe's holding the photos hostage until she pays rent, which she already agreed to. But wait, she didn't pay the rent, so he had to cover it. The lease was under both of their names, so he might have a claim for reimbursement. But demanding payment in exchange for deleting the photos might be illegal because it's using one legal issue (his ownership of the photos) to force resolution of another (her debt). That could be considered blackmail or extortion, depending on the jurisdiction. \n\nAlso, threatening to post her messages if she accuses him of abuse could be a threat, which might be illegal. Even if she threatened him first, using threats in response might escalate the situation improperly. \n\nHe mentions that he had already given the photos to law enforcement, which is interesting. Maybe there's a privacy concern there if the photos were shared without consent. But since he owns them, maybe it's legal. However, sharing nude photos even if you own them can be problematic, depending on the reason. \n\nWhen she pays him, and he deletes the photos, it seems like the transaction is done. But the initial demand for payment in exchange for deletion might still be problematic. Even if he has legal rights to the photos, using them as leverage for personal debts could be a misuse of those rights. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how he handled the situation. Threatening to sue for slander if she accuses him might be a legal threat, which could be problematic if not based on actual intent to sue. \n\nSo, considering all that, while he might have legal rights over the photos, using them to coerce payment for rent he covered could be considered wrong or illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
