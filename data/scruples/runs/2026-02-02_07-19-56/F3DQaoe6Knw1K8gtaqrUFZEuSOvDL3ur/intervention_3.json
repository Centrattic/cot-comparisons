I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is holding onto nude photos of a girl he took, not deleting them until she pays back the rent she owed. They were in a relationship, she signed rights over to the photos, but she didn't pay rent when they moved out. Now she's demanding the photos be deleted, and he's holding the payment as leverage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The author claims legal ownership of the photos via a signed release (rats might be a typo for RATS, which is a model release, like Rights Acknowledgment and Transfer Statement). If the model signed that, then legally he might have the rights to the photos. But even if that's the case, can he use the photos as leverage for unpaid rent? That's where it gets tricky. \n\nUnpaid rent is a separate issue from the rights to the photos. Using the photos as a way to collect debt could be problematic. Even if he owns the photos, threatening to release them unless she pays could be seen as blackmail or extortion, depending on the jurisdiction. Also, threatening to post her messages publicly might be a form of harassment or retaliation. \n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. The author is using personal, intimate photos as a bargaining chip. That's a power imbalance and could be considered coercive. Even if she was at fault for not paying rent, holding onto photos she wants deleted is not a legal or ethical way to handle it. He should have pursued other legal avenues for the unpaid rent, like small claims court. \n\nAlso, her threatening to accuse him of abuse and him retaliating by threatening to post her messages adds another layer. His response might be seen as a threat, which could have legal consequences. \n\nEven if he had the legal rights to the photos, using them to force payment of rent is likely inappropriate. The two issues are unrelated. He should have deleted the photos as agreed if she requested it, but sought legal recourse for the rent separately. Mixing personal grievances with legal rights is risky and likely in the wrong. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is using the photos as a weapon in a personal conflict, which is unethical and possibly illegal. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
