I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about photos that a guy took of his ex-girlfriend when they were dating. They moved in together, she stopped paying rent, and now she's asking him to delete the photos. He's holding onto them until she pays back the rent.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentions that she signed a release agreement (rats, probably a typo for model release), so he legally owns the photos. That might protect him from being accused of voyeurism or something, since she gave consent. Also, he says that courts often side with photographers on copyright issues. So maybe he's in the right legally here.\n\nBut the ethical part is tricky. Even if he has the legal rights, holding someone's nude photos for ransom over unpaid rent could be seen as wrong. The rent situation is a separate issue. She didn't pay her rent, but he's using the photos as leverage. That seems like a power play, which might not be ethical, even if it's legal. Also, he threatened to post the texts where she admitted he had the rights, and he was willing to sue her for slander if she called him abusive. That sounds aggressive and maybe even unethical, even if he's in the right legally.\n\nThen there's the part where he threatened to expose her messages. That's a form of retaliation, which could be problematic. Even if he's not legally wrong, using personal communications against someone could be emotionally harmful. The fact that she paid through a friend after two months suggests that she felt pressured, which might indicate that his actions were coercive.\n\nSo, even though he might have legal rights to the photos, the way he's using them as leverage over the rent debt, combined with the threats, could make him ethically in the wrong. The question is whether legal rights translate to moral justification. In some cases, people might argue that he's just standing up for his rights, but others would say that using personal photos as a bargaining chip is exploitative. The answer hinges on whether legal ownership of the photos gives him the right to withhold them in such a manner. Given that the rent issue is separate from the photos, using them as a negotiation tool could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of legal ownership. So, the author might be in the wrong from an ethical standpoint even if not legally.\n"
