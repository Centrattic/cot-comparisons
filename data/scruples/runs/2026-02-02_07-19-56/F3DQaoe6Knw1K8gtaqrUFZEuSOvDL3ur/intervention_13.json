I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author wrote that they took nude photos of a girl (B) during their relationship. They mention that B signed a release (probably a rights transfer agreement) giving them ownership of the photos. Then, B stopped paying rent, leading the author to pay the rent and later demand payment in exchange for deleting the photos. B tried to get the photos deleted, but the author held onto them until they got the money. B threatened to accuse the author of abuse, but the author countered with threatening to post texts and sue for slander. Eventually, B's friend paid the author, and the author deleted the photos.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the legal rights to the photos and whether the author's actions were appropriate. The author claims legal ownership via a signed waiver. If that's true, then they might have the right to keep the photos. However, even if they legally own the photos, using them as leverage for rent debt could be problematic. Rent and content ownership are separate issues. The author is essentially holding the photos as collateral for unpaid rent, which might not be legally justified. \n\nAlso, threatening to sue for slander if someone accuses them of abuse is a serious matter. Threats of legal action to retaliate against accusations, even if done through text, could be seen as intimidation or blackmail, depending on the context. The author's actions might cross legal boundaries beyond just the photos. \n\nEven if the author had the legal right to the photos, using them to get back money for rent that was unpaid could be considered extortion or some form of coercion. The line between legal rights and ethical behavior can be thin here. The author's response to B's threats by threatening to expose her messages might also be legally defensible if they are factual, but could be seen as retaliatory or even harassment. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Even if the photos were taken with consent and rights transferred, the author's refusal to delete them unless paid might not be legally required unless there was a separate agreement for that. There's no indication that B had any obligation to pay for the deletion of photos. The author is mixing two separate issues: the photos and the rent. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, using someone's private images as leverage for a debt, especially after the relationship has ended, could be considered unethical or even illegal, regardless of ownership. The threat to post the texts could be seen as a form of revenge or retaliation, which might not be protected if it's intended to harm or intimidate. \n\nSo, even if the author has the legal rights to the photos, their actions in holding them hostage for unpaid rent and threatening legal action in response to accusations may be legally problematic. The situation could involve elements of blackmail, coercion, or misuse of legal rights for personal gain beyond the original agreement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong not just ethically but potentially legally as well.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any precedent where such actions are considered acceptable. If the author had a contract that allowed them to withhold the photos until payment for the photos, that's one thing, but the rent was for the apartment, not for the photos. Mixing these is a red flag. The author is using the photos to collect a debt that's unrelated to the photos themselves. That seems like a misuse of the legal rights they hold. \n\nAdditionally, threatening to expose messages that could harm B's reputation might be protected under free speech, but if done with malicious intent, it could lead to legal issues. However, the author might have a defense if the messages are true. But the threat to sue for slander in response to B's accusation is tricky because if B's accusation is false, the author might have a case, but if it's true, then the author is retaliating. \n\nOverall, while the author might have had legal rights to the photos, their actions in using those photos to demand payment for rent and threatening legal action in response to accusations could be seen as wrong. The combination of mixing unrelated obligations (rent vs. photo rights) and using threats may cross legal and ethical boundaries.\n"
