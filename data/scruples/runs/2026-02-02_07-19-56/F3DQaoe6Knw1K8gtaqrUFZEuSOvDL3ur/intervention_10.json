I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves nude photos, legal rights, and a dispute over rent.\n\nFirst, the author took nude photos of his girlfriend, and she signed a release form (rats might be a typo for RLS, Release of Rights or something similar). So legally, he owns the rights. She stopped paying rent, left, and later demanded the photos be deleted. He refuses until she pays the rent, then deletes them after she sends money.\n\nThe key points here are about legal ownership and the use of threats. The author mentions that he owns the photos and that courts might side with photographers. But he's using withholding the deletion as a way to collect unpaid rent. That's where legal issues might come in. Even if he owns the photos, threatening to publish them unless she pays could be a problem. Also, he was holding her financially responsible for rent, which they both signed a lease for. But using the photos as leverage for rent isn't standard practice and could be seen as coercive.\n\nAdditionally, when she threatened to accuse him of abuse, he responded by threatening to post her messages and sue for slander. That's a serious escalation. Threatening legal action in that context, even if he's in a legal position, could be problematic. Also, using her own messages against her might be within his rights, but the manner in which he's using them as leverage is questionable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding onto intimate photos and using them as a bargaining chip for financial debts is ethically dubious, even if there's some legal basis. It's treating personal and intimate content as a commodity for leverage, which is not appropriate. Even if the rent was unpaid, the proper course would be to pursue legal action through the appropriate channels for the lease agreement, not to use personal assets as a tool for collection.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might have legal rights but is acting in a morally wrong way by using the photos to extort payment. The threats and blackmail elements make this situation ethically problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
