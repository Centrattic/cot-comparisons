I worked for a photography company for a while. During this time I met a girl (we'll call B) and we started dating.\n\nB and I took a bunch of nude photos of her several times throughout our relationship. She paid me for these photos and signed the rats to me. Eventually we moved into an apartment together and both signed the lease. \n\nHowever she started inviting her friends who would trash the place and I had to put my foot down and tell her they were not welcome if they would not clean anything and she decided she wouldn't pay rent. Leaving me with almost too much to pay.\n\nShe left and I continue paying as I did not want to get kicked out. After the year long lease ends, I move elsewhere.\n\nTwo years later B messages me out of the blue, demanding I delete all the photos I took of her. Normally I would but not after how she did me. So I told her that she signed a waiver giving me the rights to the photos, and even if she didn't, courts often side with photographers on the rights of the photos. \n\n\nShe then text me saying she would accuse me of manipulating her and being abusive (yes, she texted me stating me that she would lie.  I already gave them to the local law enforcement). \n\nI told her that I would not be threatened and if she wanted to try that, I will post the texts online and I dug up the Facebook messages she sent telling me that I could do whatever I wanted with the photos and confirming that she paid me to take them and knew I owned the rights. \n\nI basically say it since she was acting like that, I would give her an ultimatum. If she really wanted the photos gone, I wanted every cent she told me in rent. And I said that if she accused me of being abusive, I would post her messages and sue her for slander.\n\nNever heard back from her until 2 months later when her friend asked me to meet her and gave me the money from B. True to my word I deleted the photos in front of her and she told B. \n\nThis story is so bizarre that I'm pretty sure I fucked up one way or another. So I figured I would share it here.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not deleting nude photos of an ex until she paid back the rent. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The author mentions that the girl signed a release form giving him rights to the photos. So legally, he might have the right to keep them. But is it ethical?\n\nHe threatened her with posting her messages and suing for slander if she accused him of abuse. That sounds like a threat, which could be problematic. Even if he has legal rights, using threats might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the situation where she stopped paying rent and he kept paying, then later used that as leverage. That seems like holding a grudge and using someone's debt as a way to control what happens with the photos. It's not just about the photos anymore; it's about getting back for the financial loss. That could be seen as unethical because it's using personal information as a bargaining chip.\n\nThe part where she said she would lie about manipulation and abuse\u2014his response of threatening to post her messages is a form of coercion. Even if he has the right to keep the photos, threatening legal action for slander if she accuses him might be retaliatory and not justified.\n\nAdditionally, using the money from her friend after she sent the money through a third party... that seems like he's holding onto the money as a form of payment for the photos. But the rent was already a separate agreement. Mixing personal debts with media control is tricky.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if legally he's in the right, morally he's using a situation where she's vulnerable to get what he wants. The photos were taken in a personal relationship, and now he's using them as leverage for a financial issue. That doesn't sit well. It's about fairness and respect. \n\nAlso, the fact that he dug up her messages to use against her is a privacy invasion. It's not just about deleting photos; it's about manipulating the situation to his advantage through personal data. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if there's a legal justification, the ethical issues here are significant. The author's actions involve threats, coercion, and using personal information to retaliate. That makes him the asshole in terms of ethics, even if he's technically not breaking the law.\n"
