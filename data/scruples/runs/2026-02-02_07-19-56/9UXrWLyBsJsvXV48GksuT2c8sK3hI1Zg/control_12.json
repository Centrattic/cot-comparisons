We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a breakup, shared custody, and the mother moving in with the father under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, the father allowed the mother to stay in his house to help her get back on her feet, partly to spend more time with his son. He provided financial support, covered all living expenses, and even paid for childcare. The mother agreed to help around the house and find a job. She found a job after a month and a half but the father is upset because she was partying and not working as hard as he expected. Then she lashed out at him, leading to the father wanting to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are the terms of their agreement. The mother agreed to help around the house and get a job. She did find a job, albeit after some time. The father feels she's not living up to her responsibilities, but does she actually violate the agreement? The job was found eventually, so maybe the delay was the issue. Also, her partying might be a personal choice, not necessarily against the agreement unless specified.\n\nThe father's motives for letting her stay were partly self-serving (to spend more time with the son). The mother's behavior, like leaving messes and partying, might be problematic, but unless they violated specific terms of their agreement, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The father's frustration is valid, but he might have set unclear expectations.\n\nWhen the mother insults him after he brings up concerns, that's a conflict. However, the father's desire to retaliate by kicking her out could be seen as unfair, especially since he initially offered her a six-month stay. He might be overreacting, especially if there's no formal agreement to breach. The fear of her blocking access to his son is also a valid concern, but that's more about custody laws, which might not be addressed here.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the father might have the right to ask her to leave if she breaches the agreement. However, the agreement details are crucial. If there's no written contract, it's hard to enforce. The mother's actions might not clearly breach the terms, so the father could be in the wrong by not addressing the issues through proper channels or by retaliating without cause.\n\nOverall, the father's position is complex. He provided support but set unclear expectations. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the father's retaliation might be disproportionate. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if the agreement was verbal and the father's terms weren't strictly followed, but there's nuance. However, since the father initiated the situation with a specific offer, he might be expected to handle the issues without retaliation, so maybe A (in the wrong). Wait, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The author wants to kick her out for her behavior. If the agreement didn't specify consequences for her actions, then the author might be wrong to retaliate. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
