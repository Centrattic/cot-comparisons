We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the dad is letting the mom stay in his house in exchange for her helping out and getting a job, but she's not meeting his expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad and mom broke up, and the mom moved out with the kid. He had custody on weekends and covered childcare so she could work. Then, because she couldn't afford rent, he offered her a place to stay if she helps and gets a job. She agreed. However, she didn't clean up her stuff, took a long time to get a job, partied a lot, and when he confronted her, she attacked him with lies.\n\nThe dad wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his custody. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there was an informal agreement (not a legal contract), the dad might have obligations. But since he's the one who created the agreement, he might have the right to end it if she's not fulfilling her part. However, there's a concern about custody. If the child's well-being is affected, the courts might get involved. The dad is also providing childcare and support, which is good, but the mom's behavior could be seen as neglectful. \n\nEmotionally, the dad feels jealous and upset about her lifestyle. But he's the one who set up the arrangement with conditions. If she's violating those, he's within his rights to end the agreement. However, he might need to consider the impact on the child and ensure that custody arrangements don't get disrupted. \n\nThe mom's response of attacking him and lying might indicate a pattern of behavior, which could be a reason for the dad to reassess the living situation. But he also needs to handle it carefully to avoid any legal issues regarding the child. \n\nSo, is the dad in the wrong? Well, offering her a place to stay with conditions and then ending it if she doesn't meet them isn't inherently wrong. However, he should ensure that his actions don't negatively impact his custody rights. The main issue is whether his actions are justified based on the agreement they had. Since it's an informal agreement, he might be justified in asking her to leave if she's not meeting the terms. But he needs to be cautious about how he proceeds to avoid legal backlash. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the dad might be in the right because he set conditions and she didn't meet them. But he also might have overstepped if he's using the child's custody as leverage. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. Given the circumstances, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had conditions, she didn't meet them, and he's trying to address the situation.\n"
