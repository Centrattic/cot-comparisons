We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who wants to kick out their ex-partner, the mother of their child, after she moved in under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The ex moved in under an agreement where she was supposed to help around the house, find a job, and the author covers her expenses. The ex took time to get a job, partied a lot, and was disrespectful. The author feels wronged because they've been paying child support and trying to spend time with their son, but the ex is not fulfilling her part of the deal. \n\nLegally, the author might be within their rights to ask her to leave, especially if the initial agreement was informal or verbal. However, there's a mention of a time-sharing agreement, so if there are legal custody arrangements, the author has to be careful not to interfere with the child's visitation rights. The ex might use the author's actions to block access to the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nEthically, the author's motivations were mixed\u2014helping her a bit but mainly to spend more time with their son. The ex's behavior (not working, partying, being disrespectful) is problematic. The author tried to address these issues but was met with hostility and false accusations. The ex's actions seem to be violating the initial agreement, so the author's desire to end the arrangement isn't unreasonable. \n\nBut there's a risk of the ex retaliating, which complicates things. The author might need to document everything and possibly involve legal means to ensure they don't lose access to their son. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex isn't meeting her obligations and the author has tried to communicate, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the situation. The key points are the breach of agreement by the ex and the author's reasonable response.\n"
