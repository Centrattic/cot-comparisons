We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author (let's call them Parent A) and the ex (Parent B) have a son. They broke up a year or two ago. Parent B moved out with the kid, and there's a time-sharing agreement where Parent A gets the kid on weekends and sometimes during the week. Parent A has been paying child support, covering all the kid's expenses, and even helping Parent B find work by taking the child to childcare so Parent B can look for a job. \n\nThen, Parent B couldn't afford rent and moved back in with Parent A, under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. Parent A offered this partly to help her but mainly to spend more time with their son. \n\nBut the first few weeks were messy\u2014Parent B left stuff in the son's room, didn't clean up, took a month and a half to get a job at a fast food place, and in the meantime was partying, going to festivals, staying at a boyfriend's, vacations. Parent A is upset because they think this isn't appropriate behavior for a mother and they feel jealous because they can't do those things due to work. When Parent A confronts her, she attacks them, calling them a deadbeat and lying, which hurts Parent A.\n\nParent A wants to kick her out but feels bad because they told her she could stay for six months. Also, worried that if they retaliate, Parent B might try to prevent them from seeing their son. The question is whether Parent A is in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about the key points here. \n\nFirst, Parent A has been fulfilling their responsibilities: paying child support, providing childcare, working full-time, and trying to maintain the time-sharing. They made a good-faith offer to help Parent B move in with them to get back on her feet, which Parent B accepted. However, Parent B didn't meet the terms of that agreement\u2014she didn't help around the house, took a long time to find a job, engaged in partying, etc. \n\nNow, Parent A is upset because Parent B isn't following through on their part of the deal. They confronted Parent B, who responded with anger and lies. Parent A feels justified in wanting to end the arrangement because Parent B hasn't held up her end. \n\nBut the question is whether Parent A is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the terms of the agreement were clear and if Parent B violated them. Since the arrangement was that Parent B would help around the house and find a job, and she didn't do those things as agreed, Parent A has grounds to ask her to leave. \n\nHowever, maybe there are other factors. For example, if Parent A didn't have a formal agreement, just an informal one, maybe there's ambiguity. Also, Parent A's motivations were mixed\u2014they wanted to help Parent B but mainly wanted to see their son more. But the main issue is whether Parent B breached the agreement. \n\nParent A is also worried about retaliation, but that's more about potential consequences rather than whether they're wrong. If Parent B was acting in bad faith from the start, then Parent A isn't at fault for wanting to end the arrangement. \n\nAnother angle: Parent A's jealousy about not being able to party might be a personal issue, but Parent B's actions (partying, not working) are the main problem. Parent A's feelings of jealousy might be valid but not the central issue here. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, since Parent A owns the home, they can probably set the terms of who lives there, unless there are legal agreements in place. But the question is about moral/ethical wrongdoing, not legal. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Parent A offered help with conditions. Parent B didn't meet those conditions. Parent A is within their rights to ask her to leave. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
