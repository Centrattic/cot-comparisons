We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to kick his son's mother out of his house. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex had a breakup a couple of years ago. The ex moved out with their son, but they had a time-sharing agreement where the author had the kid on weekends and covered childcare costs during the week so she could find a job. He's been paying child support and taking care of his son's expenses. Then, when the ex couldn't afford her rent, he offered her to stay at his place under certain conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, and getting back on her feet. She accepted, but the author admits he was 50% altruistic and 50% wanting to see his son more.\n\nNow, the ex has been staying there, but she's not meeting the terms. She took a month and a half to get a job, partying and socializing a lot, which the author finds unacceptable and even a bit jealous of because he's working hard. When he confronts her, she attacks him with lies and insults, calling him a deadbeat. The author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised she could stay for six months and is worried about potential retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nFirst, legally, if they're cohabiting, there might be issues about tenancy. If he's a landlord, he can't just kick her out without following proper procedures. But since they're exes and not married, it's tricky. He might have a verbal agreement, but without a legal contract, he can't enforce it. However, he can still ask her to leave, though she might have to go through legal steps if she's living there as a tenant.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels he's been doing his part by providing for the child and supporting the ex's job search. The ex, on the other hand, is not meeting the agreed-upon responsibilities and is disrespectful when confronted. The author's jealousy and frustration might be influencing his desire to kick her out, but the main issue is her not fulfilling the terms they had.\n\nThe author's initial offer to help her was conditional on her finding a job and contributing. If she's not meeting those conditions, it's reasonable for him to reassess the arrangement. However, the six-month promise complicates things. He might need to address the issues first, like discussing her job search progress and the mess in the son's room, before deciding to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe ex's behavior\u2014being disrespectful and attacking him when he brings up problems\u2014is problematic. That kind of conflict can be harmful, especially in a co-parenting situation. The author's concern about retaliation is valid, but if he handles this through legal channels and documents everything, he might be able to protect his access to his son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not legally in the wrong if he follows proper procedures to end the arrangement. Emotionally, he's frustrated with her not meeting the terms and her disrespectful behavior. The key point is whether the conditions he set were clear and if he's given her a fair chance to meet them. If he hasn't, then he might be in a gray area. But based on the information, he seems to have given her time to get a job and addressed the mess, so he's probably justified in wanting to end the arrangement if she's not complying.\n"
