We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who lets his ex live with him to see his son more, but she's not pulling her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author and the ex broke up, and she moved out with the kid. He had a time-sharing agreement and paid child support. She had no job, so he helped her by letting her stay in his house if she found a job and helped around the house. She took a month and a half to get a job at fast food and spent time partying and on vacations. He's upset she's not being a good mother and is jealous he can't do those things. When he confronts her, she attacks him with lies. He wants to kick her out but feels bound by the six-month agreement and fears she'll block him from seeing his son.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if there's a time-sharing agreement, the father's rights to the child aren't necessarily at risk unless there's a court order. Letting the ex live with him is a personal arrangement, not part of the legal custody. If the ex is violating the terms (like not finding a job, being disrespectful), he has grounds to end the arrangement. But he needs to be careful not to interfere with the custody agreement. Ethically, the father's main goal was to see his son more, which is valid. However, enabling her to stay might have been more for his own benefit than hers. Her behavior is problematic, but the father also has a responsibility to maintain the agreed-upon custody terms without being hostile.\n\nHe's in a tough spot because he's trying to balance his time with his son and his own life. The ex's behavior is clearly irresponsible, but the father's initial offer wasn't entirely altruistic. When he confronts her, she responds with hostility, which he's justified in being upset about. However, if he kicks her out now, he needs to ensure that doesn't affect the custody agreement. Legally, he's not in the wrong for ending a personal living arrangement, especially if she's violating the terms. But he should check the legal custody arrangements to avoid any issues with child access. Emotionally, his jealousy and frustration are understandable given the situation. Since the ex moved in under certain conditions she didn't meet, the father isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. So the answer is B.\n"
