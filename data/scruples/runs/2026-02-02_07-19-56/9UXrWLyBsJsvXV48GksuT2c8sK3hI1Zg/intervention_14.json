We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup between the user and the mother of his son, and now she's living with him under certain conditions. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the user and the mother broke up a year or two ago. He has been following the time-sharing agreement, covering child support, and even helping her by letting her stay in his house if she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. He did this partly to help her but mainly to spend more time with his son. \n\nNow, she's been acting in ways that bother him: making a mess, not getting a job quickly, partying, going on vacations, being disrespectful when he confronts her. He wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months. Also, he's worried she might retaliate by affecting his visitation rights.\n\nSo, why might he be in the wrong? Well, he offered her a place to stay with specific conditions. She agreed to those conditions. If he lets her stay for six months regardless of her actions, that could be seen as breaking his own conditions. But he's not necessarily in the wrong for changing his mind if those conditions aren't being met. However, he did have a mutual agreement. By not enforcing the terms from the start, maybe he's partly responsible for the current situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's not fulfilling her part of the deal (helping around the house, finding a job promptly, not being disrespectful), then he's justified in ending the arrangement. But since he's the one who set the conditions, he might have a point in wanting to end it now. However, he also needs to consider the emotional impact on his son and the legal implications regarding custody and visitation. If she retaliates by trying to cut him off, he might have to face legal consequences for changing the living situation without proper arrangement.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's breaking the agreement he made, then he might be in the wrong. However, if she violated the terms he set, then he can end it. The problem is that he might not have a clear legal agreement, just a personal one. So if he kicks her out without a valid reason (from a legal standpoint), he might be in the wrong because she could argue that he's interfering with her access to the child. \n\nAlso, his motivations for letting her stay were partly self-serving (to see his son more), which might mean he didn't have the best intentions, but that's more about his own ethics than legal or moral wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, if he's breaking a mutual agreement he made without just cause, then he's in the wrong. But if she breached the agreement, he's not. But since the terms weren't formalized, it's a bit murky. The key is that he set conditions for her to stay, and she didn't meet them, so he's within his rights to end the arrangement. However, he needs to be cautious about how he does it to avoid legal issues. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong morally. Since he's the one who set the terms and she didn't follow them, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No). But I'm a bit confused because the user says he's in the wrong. Maybe because he's using the child's presence as a reason to keep her there? But I think the main point is about the agreement he made. If he's breaking it without cause, he's wrong. But if she broke it first, he's not. Since she didn't meet her part, he's justified. So answer B.\n"
