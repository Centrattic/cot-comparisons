We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his ex's mother who moved into his house. \n\nFirst, the background: The man and the woman broke up, their son is involved in a time-sharing agreement. The woman wasn't working, so he took more time with the kid and covered childcare so she could find a job. He offered her a place to stay under the condition she helps out, finds a job, etc. She agreed but hasn't been following through, partying, and there's conflict when he confronts her. She accuses him of being a deadbeat, which he feels is unfair because he's been paying child support and working hard.\n\nThe author wants to kick her out but is conflicted because he promised six months, and fears retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nNow, to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points here are his motivations, the agreement, and his actions. He admitted part of his reason for letting her stay was to see his son more, not just to help her. That's a bit self-serving. Also, he's frustrated with her behavior, which he perceives as irresponsible. She hasn't met the terms of the agreement (job, helping around the house), and there's conflict when he confronts her. She's been disrespectful and attacked him.\n\nLegally, if this is a rental agreement, he can't just kick her out without cause, but since it's a personal arrangement, maybe he's within his rights if she's violating the terms. The main issue is whether he's justified in wanting to evict her based on her not upholding her end.\n\nEthically, he did offer a deal with conditions. She didn't meet them, so he's within his rights to reconsider his offer. However, his initial motivation was partly selfish, which complicates things. But he's also been supporting her and the child financially. His frustration is understandable. She's been disrespectful and uncooperative, which adds to his justification.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions often consider intentions, fairness, and consequences. Here, the author's actions seem to stem from a breach of the agreed terms. While his initial offer may have been partly self-interested, he's now standing by the terms when she hasn't met them. The other person's disrespectful behavior is a red flag. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not, because he's addressing a breach of agreement and her misconduct. The answer might be B (No).\n"
