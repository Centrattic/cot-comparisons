We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent wanting to kick out their ex-partner, the mother of their son, after she moved in. The user is the father, and they've been having some issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The father and ex-mother broke up a couple of years ago. He had a time-sharing agreement, paying child support and covering expenses. When the mother couldn't afford rent, he offered her a place to stay if she helped out, found a job, and got back on her feet. He covered rent and living expenses. But she didn't clean up her stuff in the son's room for weeks, took a month and a half to get a job, and partied a lot. He confronted her, but she lashed out, called him a deadbeat and lied. Now he wants to kick her out but feels bad because he said she could stay six months and is worried about losing access to his son.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider the key points here. The father provided a place for her under certain conditions. She didn't meet those conditions initially, though she eventually got a job. He's upset about her behavior and the confrontation. The law might not be the focus here; more about the moral or social perspective. \n\nThe father's main arguments: He's been paying child support, covering expenses, and wanted to help her. She didn't clean up, was slow to get a job, partied, and lashed out when confronted. He feels disrespected and wants to end the arrangement. \n\nThe mother's side: She moved in under the condition to find a job, which she did eventually, though slowly. She might be struggling with employment and using her free time as she pleases, which the father disapproves of. But her behavior during the confrontation was hostile.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, who's at fault? The father set conditions, and she didn't meet them promptly. But he also admitted to helping her partly to see his son more. When she moved in, the time-sharing agreement remained the same, so maybe he's still following the original schedule. The mother not cleaning up and not getting a job quickly could be seen as not upholding her part. The confrontation where she attacked him with lies and insults is a problem. The father wants to kick her out, which he might be within his rights to do if the conditions were not met. But he feels conflicted because he made a six-month promise and fears legal repercussions regarding child custody.\n\nIs the father in the wrong for wanting to kick her out? If she breached the agreement, maybe not. But the father's own admission of partial self-interest in allowing her to stay might affect that. However, if he's been fulfilling his responsibilities, and she's not meeting hers, he might not be in the wrong. The key points are the broken conditions and the hostile response from her. The answer would likely be B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
