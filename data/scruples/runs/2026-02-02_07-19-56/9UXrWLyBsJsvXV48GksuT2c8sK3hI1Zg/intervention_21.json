We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to kick out his ex-partner, the mother of his son, after she moved in with him under certain conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the ex broke up a couple of years ago, and they have a time-sharing agreement where the author sees their son on weekends and sometimes during the week. The ex wasn't working, so the author helped by taking the kid more often and paying for childcare so she could look for a job. The author consistently pays child support and covers the kid's expenses.\n\nThen, the ex couldn't afford her rent, so the author offered her a place to stay if she helped around the house, found a job, and committed to getting back on her feet. The author mentions that part of the reason was to see his son more, but he's also helping her. She accepted. The first few weeks were messy; she left a mess in the son's room, which he had to push her to clean. She took a month and a half to get a job, spent time partying, going on vacations, etc., which the author finds upsetting, especially since he's working hard and has the same time-sharing arrangement. When he brings up these issues, she attacks him, calls him a deadbeat with lies, and this isn't the first time.\n\nNow, the author wants to kick her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay for six months. He's also worried she might retaliate by affecting his visitation rights. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's main issue is with her behavior and her not meeting the agreed-upon conditions (helping around the house, getting a job). He's also frustrated by her disrespectful responses and her actions that he sees as neglecting responsibilities as a mother. He's providing a place for her, covering expenses, and she's not fulfilling her end. \n\nBut then, there's the question of whether he's in the wrong. The ex moved in under the condition that she would help and find a job. If she's not meeting those terms, maybe the author has grounds to ask her to leave. However, he also wanted to see his son more, which could be a self-serving motive, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The ex's behavior is problematic, but the author's decision to ask her out might be justified if she's violating the agreement. However, he did agree to let her stay for six months, so ending it before that could be an issue. Also, there's the aspect of child custody and the potential for her to retaliate, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach to addressing issues by bringing them up and then feeling attacked might be part of a communication problem. He might need to find a better way to discuss issues without escalating to conflict. But the core issue is whether her actions justify him wanting to kick her out. Since she's not meeting the agreed terms, maybe he's within his rights. However, the six-month agreement is a point. If he allowed her to stay for six months, ending it early could be a breach unless there was a clause about performance. Also, the emotional aspect of the child's well-being is a factor here. If the ex's behavior is affecting the child, that's another layer. But the author is also the one paying for childcare and covering expenses, which shows he's contributing.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if she's not meeting her responsibilities, but he should consider the agreed-upon six months. However, if the agreement was verbal and she's clearly not fulfilling her part, he might have grounds. The fact that he's also using this to see his son more could be a self-serving motive, but if the ex is neglecting responsibilities, it might be justified. The answer might hinge on the terms of their agreement and the specific circumstances.\n"
