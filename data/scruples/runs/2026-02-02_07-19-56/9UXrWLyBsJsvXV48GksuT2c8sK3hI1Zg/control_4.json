We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-partner and their child. The man (the poster) and the ex (not named Karen) broke up a year or two ago. They have a time-sharing agreement, and he's been covering childcare costs so she could find a job. She couldn't afford rent, so he offered her a place to stay with the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and pays back. She agreed, and now he's considering kicking her out because she's been messy, took time to get a job, partied a lot, and he feels she's not a good mother. She also insulted him when he confronted her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The poster is doing a lot\u2014paying child support, taking care of the kid's expenses, letting her live with him to see his son more. But he's also being critical of her lifestyle choices, like partying and going to festivals. The ex isn't working steadily, took a month and a half to get a job, and maybe isn't pulling her weight around the house. The poster feels he's been a good parent but is now frustrated. The ex, on the other hand, lashes out when confronted, which might be a sign of defensiveness or resentment.\n\nThe key points here are the terms of her staying. He offered her a six-month stay with conditions. If she violated those conditions, he has grounds to ask her to leave. However, he also admitted he didn't help 100% out of altruism; part of it was to see his son more. That might complicate things because his motives could affect his judgment. Also, her behavior\u2014partying, not working\u2014might be problematic, but is it grounds for eviction? If the agreement was clear and she's not meeting her end, then he's justified in wanting to end the arrangement. However, the emotional aspect, like jealousy over his limited time compared to her, could be a personal issue. The ex's reaction to confrontation is also a factor; if she's been disrespectful and lying, that adds to the tension.\n\nLegally, if there's a lease or written agreement, that's clearer. But since it's a verbal agreement, things are murkier. He might be in the right if she's breaching the terms. However, if the conditions weren't clearly communicated or enforceable, it's his word against hers. Emotionally, he's frustrated, but he's also in a position where he's providing shelter and support. Her behavior might be a red flag for her not being responsible, but her circumstances (unstable job history) could be part of the problem.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. Since he set conditions she didn't meet, he's probably not in the wrong. However, his motives (partly wanting more time with the kid) might make the situation more complex. But in terms of fairness, if she's violating the agreement, he's justified. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
