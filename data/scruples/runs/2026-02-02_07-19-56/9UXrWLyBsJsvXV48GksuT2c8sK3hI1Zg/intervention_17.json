We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, co-parenting, and a current living arrangement where the ex moved in with the father to reduce rent costs. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the father and the mother of the son broke up a couple of years ago. The father has been covering child support, childcare, and taking the kid as much as possible. When the mother couldn't afford her rent (due to lack of steady job), the father offered her a place to stay if she helped around the house, found a job, and contributed. The mother agreed. The father admits he did this partly to spend more time with his son.\n\nNow, the mother's behavior after moving in is the issue. She made a mess in the son's room, took a month and a half to find a job, and spent time partying, going on vacations, etc. The father is upset not just because of her behavior but also because he feels jealous about not having the same freedom. When he confronts her, she attacks him with insults and lies. Now, he wants to kick her out but is worried about the repercussions on his access to his son.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nThe father's actions: He offered a living arrangement with conditions. He allowed her to stay under the premise that she would work and help out. If she didn't meet those conditions, he might have the right to reconsider. However, he had a clear agreement, and she agreed to it. If she's not fulfilling her part, he might be justified in ending the arrangement. Also, his motivation was partly to see his son more, which is understandable in co-parenting scenarios.\n\nThe mother's actions: She agreed to the terms but didn't follow through promptly. Taking a month and a half to secure a job could be seen as slow, especially if she was capable. However, job searches can take time depending on the market. Her behavior of partying and vacationing might be seen as irresponsible, especially as a parent. However, the father's own behavior\u2014like being jealous of her social activities\u2014might not be fair, considering he's working hard but not getting the same freedom.\n\nNow, the confrontation aspect: When the father brings up his concerns, the mother responds with personal attacks. This is problematic because she's not addressing his valid concerns but instead retaliating. The father's frustration is understandable, but his desire to kick her out after six months might be influenced by his own feelings of jealousy and the stress of the situation.\n\nLegal considerations: The father's living arrangement with the mother might not be legally binding unless there was a written agreement. If it's verbal, he might not have grounds to enforce the terms. However, if they have an informal agreement, he could end it, but the mother might use this to challenge his custody or visitation rights.\n\nEthically, the father wanted to help the mother find stability but also wanted more time with his son. If she didn't meet the agreed conditions, he's within his rights to change the arrangement. However, his jealousy and the mother's past behavior complicate things. The mother's actions could be seen as neglecting her responsibilities, but the father's own motivations mix helping with personal gain.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The mother didn't meet the agreed terms, and the father might be justified in ending the arrangement. However, the father's personal motivations (jealousy, wanting more time) might cloud his judgment. If the father terminates the agreement without fulfilling his part or if the mother retaliates, both could have issues. But based on the information given, the mother isn't meeting her end of the deal. The father's desire to kick her out is a reaction to her not fulfilling the agreement, which he set up. Therefore, maybe the father isn't in the wrong here. But I need to check if there's any fault on his side.\n\nWait, the father also mentions that he's working full-time and covering all the child's expenses. The mother's lack of job stability is a problem, but the father didn't enforce consequences until now. The initial offer to help her find a job might be seen as generous, but if she didn't follow through, he can revoke the offer. However, if he's using this as a way to control her behavior towards the child, that's a different issue. Also, the mother's attacks on him are her fault, but the father's reaction to her behavior might be valid.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the key is whether the father is overstepping by wanting to kick her out. If the agreement was six months, and she hasn't met the terms, he's not wrong for enforcing it. However, if he's doing it out of spite from the arguments rather than the agreement, that could be his fault. The description says he's been upset about her behavior and the confrontation made things worse. But his request is to kick her out because she's been disrespectful and not fulfilling her part. The answer might hinge on whether the father is justified in ending the agreement due to her not meeting the terms, regardless of his personal feelings. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and he's trying to enforce an agreement she agreed to, maybe he's not. So the answer would be B.\n"
