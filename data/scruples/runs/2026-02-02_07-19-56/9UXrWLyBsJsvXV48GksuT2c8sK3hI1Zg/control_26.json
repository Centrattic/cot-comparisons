We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who let his ex-partner (not Karen) live with him after their breakup to see his son more often. He offered her a place to stay under the condition she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. She initially didn't take those conditions seriously, took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and the man feels she's not being a good mother. He confronts her, but she attacks him back, calling him a deadbeat and lying. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about the consequences regarding child custody.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The man provided shelter and childcare, which is a big responsibility. He did so partially to see his son more, which isn't inherently wrong. However, when he allowed her to stay, he set conditions. She didn't meet those conditions initially, which could be a problem. But he's also the one who agreed to let her stay for six months. Now he wants to kick her out before that time, which might be an issue if there was an agreement.\n\nBut the main conflict here is about the conditions she didn't meet. If the agreement was that she'd help around the house and find a job, and she didn't do that for a while, maybe he's justified in wanting her out. However, he's also being critical of her lifestyle choices, like partying and going on vacations, which might not be his place. Also, when he confronts her, she gets defensive and attacks him. But the key point is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out.\n\nAnother angle: child custody. The time-sharing agreement is in place. If she moves out, would that affect his access to the child? The man is worried she might retaliate and prevent him from seeing his son. This complicates things because he's trying to balance his own needs as a parent with his responsibility to the child. However, he's not the legal guardian anymore, so he needs to ensure his actions don't jeopardize his custody rights.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. The fact that he agreed to six months but she didn't meet the terms might mean he's not in the wrong. However, if the agreement was verbal and not legally binding, he might be able to end it if the terms aren't being followed. On the other hand, if he's providing her a home, there might be some expectations of a lease or tenancy agreement, which could require notice or have other legal implications if he kicks her out without cause.\n\nAlso, his motivations are mixed\u2014he wanted to see his son more, which is understandable, but the way he's handling the situation might not be the best. He's upset about her behavior and the fact that she's not contributing, but his criticism about her lifestyle might be judgmental. However, the core issue is whether he's allowed to terminate the arrangement if she's breaching the agreed conditions.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, if he's the landlord and she's a tenant, he might be able to give her notice if she's violating the terms of their agreement. If they had a verbal agreement, it can be more complicated, but if she's not fulfilling her part (helping with chores, finding a job), he might have grounds to terminate the agreement. However, the time frame (six months) might be a sticking point. If she agreed to stay for six months regardless of performance, then he might be in the wrong for kicking her out early. But if the agreement was conditional on her meeting certain responsibilities, then he's justified.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the man) is in the wrong. The main factors are: Did he set clear conditions when allowing her to stay? Did she agree to those conditions? If yes, and she didn't meet them, then he's not in the wrong for ending the agreement. However, if there was a fixed term (six months) regardless of performance, then he might be in the wrong for terminating early. But the user mentioned that he told her she could stay for six months, but the conditions were that she helps and finds a job. So if she didn't meet those, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the emotional aspect: he's upset about her behavior and the confrontation. But the main issue is about the terms of their agreement. Since he's the one providing the home and resources, he has the right to set boundaries. If those boundaries were breached, he's justified in wanting her to leave. However, the fear of her retaliating and affecting his custody is valid, but that's a separate legal matter. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out, which depends on the terms of their agreement. If she violated the terms, he's not in the wrong. If he allowed her to stay without conditions, then maybe he is. But according to the story, he did set conditions, and she didn't meet them. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
