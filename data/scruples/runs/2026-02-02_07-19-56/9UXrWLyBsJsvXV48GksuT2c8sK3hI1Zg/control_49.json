We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the mom moved out, and the dad let her stay at his house with the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. Now, she's been partying, not cleaning properly, and there's conflict. He wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The dad allowed her to stay under certain conditions. She agreed to those terms. However, she didn't meet them. She took two months to get a job, partied a lot, left a mess. Then when he confronts her, she attacks him. He's considering kicking her out but is worried about legal repercussions, like her trying to block his time with the son.\n\nLegally, the situation might be tricky. If there's no formal agreement (like a lease or written contract), he might not have grounds to evict her. But since she's there under a verbal agreement, he could still ask her to leave, especially if she's violating the terms. But if she's staying in the house, maybe it's considered her home too, depending on local laws. Also, child custody and visitation rights are involved. If she moves out, could she challenge his custody time? That's a concern.\n\nEmotionally, the dad feels wronged because he's been paying child support and helping her, but she's not reciprocating. The mom's behavior seems irresponsible. However, the dad might have overstepped by allowing her to stay under certain conditions without a clear agreement. If he didn't document the terms, it's hard to enforce them.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he set conditions she didn't meet. But if there's no legal agreement, his ability to enforce those conditions is limited. He might be in a position where he can ask her to leave because she's not following the terms, but if she's using the house as her residence, he can't just kick her out without legal process. Also, if she has a right to be there (like if it's her home now), then he might not have the authority. However, if she was staying under his lease, maybe he can terminate the arrangement.\n\nThe key points are: the dad offered help with conditions, she didn't meet them, and he wants to end the arrangement. Legally, if there's no agreement, he can't force her out without following proper procedures. But if she was a guest or under a lease she agreed to, then maybe he can. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to enforce the terms he set, but there's a legal aspect to consider. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. Morally, if he set conditions and she broke them, he's not wrong to want to end the arrangement. But the answer options are A or B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) is the answer, even if there are legal complexities.\n"
