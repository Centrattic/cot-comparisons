We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, co-parenting, and the mother moving in with the father to save rent. The father offered her a place to stay under certain conditions, like helping around the house and finding a job. She eventually got a job, but there were issues with her behavior, like not cleaning up, partying, and being disrespectful when confronted.\n\nFirst, the father did support the mother by letting her stay, covering rent, and helping with childcare so she could find work. That shows he tried to be accommodating. However, the mother didn't meet his expectations\u2014she took time to get a job, partied, and was dismissive of his concerns. When he confronted her, she attacked him, which added to the tension.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Did the father have a right to set conditions for her staying? If he agreed to let her stay under certain terms, and she violated them, he might have a right to ask her to leave. However, he also admitted that part of his motivation was to see his son more, which complicates things. The mother's behavior was problematic, but was the father's offer of housing a formal agreement? If it was verbal and not a legal contract, he might have the right to change his mind, especially if she's not meeting his expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the father might have a responsibility to ensure his son's well-being. If the mother is being disrespectful and not contributing, it could affect the child. But the father is also working hard and trying to maintain the time-sharing agreement. The mother's job situation is unstable, but she did eventually get a job. The conflict seems more about their personal dynamics than the child's welfare.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. Since the mother violated the terms he set (helping around the house, finding a job) and the living arrangement was a mutual agreement, the father might be justified in wanting her out. However, the emotional aspect and the potential impact on their son need to be considered. The father's jealousy and frustration could be valid, but reacting by kicking her out without considering legal consequences (like her fighting custody) is a risk.\n\nIn conclusion, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong because the living arrangement was his offer, and she didn't meet his expectations. However, he should approach it carefully to avoid legal issues. The answer is B.\n"
