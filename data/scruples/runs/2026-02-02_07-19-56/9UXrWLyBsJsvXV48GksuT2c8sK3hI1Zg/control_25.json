We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author and the ex-girlfriend (not Karen) have a son. They broke up a year or two ago, and she moved out with the kid. They have a time-sharing arrangement where the author has the son on weekends. The mother wasn't working, so the author took more days during the week and paid for childcare to help her get a job. The author has been paying all child support, working full-time, and covering the kid's expenses.\n\nThen, the mother couldn't afford her rent, so the author offered her a place to stay with conditions: help around the house, find a job, and get back on her feet. The author covers rent and living expenses. But the mother's behavior since moving in has been problematic. She left a mess in the son's room, took a month and a half to get a job (starting next week), partied, went to festivals, vacations, etc. The author is upset because this isn't appropriate for a mother and is jealous because he can't do those things. When he confronts her, she attacks him and calls him a deadbeat, which he finds hurtful. He wants to kick her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay six months. He's worried about retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial offer: the author allowed her to stay in exchange for her finding a job and helping out. She took a month and a half to get a job, which is a bit slow, but maybe she wasn't actively looking. However, he mentions she was partying, etc. So maybe she wasn't taking the job search seriously. The author's offer had conditions, so if she's not meeting them, he might have a right to ask her to leave. However, the problem is that he's her landlord, so there's a power dynamic here. If he's her landlord, he can't just kick her out without proper legal process. But maybe in this situation, he's not a landlord in the traditional sense. Since she's his ex and they have a child in common, it's a shared living arrangement, which complicates things.\n\nThe mother's behavior: leaving a mess, not helping out, partying. The author is upset because he's working hard, while she's not contributing as agreed. Also, when he confronts her, she attacks him with lies and insults. That's a valid reason for wanting to end the arrangement, especially if she's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nThe author's motives: he admitted he wanted to see his son more, which is understandable. But he also wanted to help her. However, helping her was conditional on her meeting certain obligations. If she's not fulfilling those, he's justified in reconsidering the arrangement.\n\nPotential legal issues: If the mother is living in his house with the kid, and he's the one paying rent, there might be legal considerations. If she moves out, how does that affect custody and visitation? The author is worried she might retaliate by keeping the son from him. That's a real concern, especially if there's no clear legal agreement. The original time-sharing agreement might be key here. If she moves out, does that change the custody arrangement? The author needs to be cautious to avoid violating any legal agreements.\n\nEthically, the author set conditions and the mother didn't meet them. He's allowed to ask her to leave, but he needs to do it properly. However, if he does so without a legal agreement, the mother could potentially challenge it, leading to legal issues affecting custody. So he has to consider the legal aspects here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he's allowed to have conditions for her staying, then he's not in the wrong for asking her to leave if she's not meeting those conditions. However, he needs to handle it through proper channels, maybe with a written agreement, to avoid legal trouble. The fact that he's worried about retaliation suggests he's aware of the risks, but he still feels justified because she's not meeting her end of the deal.\n\nThe mother's actions: She's not fulfilling the conditions she agreed to, which is her fault. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. However, he should ensure that any eviction is done legally to protect his rights regarding custody and visitation. The main issue here is whether he's allowed to ask her to leave, which seems acceptable if there's an agreement in place. Since he mentioned telling her she could stay for six months, maybe there was a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court, but he's justified in trying to end it if she's not meeting the terms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. His conditions weren't met, and he's justified in wanting to end the arrangement. The mother's behavior and lack of compliance are her responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
