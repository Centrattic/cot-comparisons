We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, co-parenting, and living arrangements. \n\nFirst, the ex-partner (the author) allowed the mother of his son to stay in his house under the condition that she finds a job and helps around the house. The mother accepted, but didn't meet the expectations. She took a long time to get a job, partied, and didn't clean up. The author is upset and wants her out because of her behavior and disrespect. However, he feels conflicted because he promised her six months.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects. Allowing someone to live in your home is typically a lease or rental agreement. If there's no formal written agreement, the terms might be verbal. The author might not be able to just kick her out without legal justification. But since she's there under a specific arrangement, if she's violating the terms (like not finding a job quickly), maybe the author has grounds. However, in many jurisdictions, landlords can't just evict tenants without proper notice and legal process. Even if it's a verbal agreement, the author would need to follow proper procedures, which could involve giving notice and possibly going to court.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author is working hard, covering expenses, and trying to see his son. The mother isn't contributing as agreed and is acting disrespectfully. But he did promise six months. Breaking that promise might be seen as unfair. However, if she's violating the terms of the agreement, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement early.\n\nAlso, the mother's behavior is questionable. She's not meeting her responsibilities, which affects the household. The author's desire to spend more time with his son is understandable. But the way he's approaching the situation, especially if he's planning to \"retaliate\" by kicking her out without following legal steps, could be problematic. If she retaliates by trying to cut off access to the child, that's another layer of conflict.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical factors, the author's intentions might be justified, but his actions could be legally unsound if he doesn't follow proper eviction procedures. However, since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether he's violating the agreement he made. If he allowed her to stay for six months and now wants to break that, he might be in the wrong unless there's a valid reason (like breach of contract). If the mother breached the terms by not finding a job or being disrespectful, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement early. But legally, he needs to handle it properly. Ethically, it's a gray area because both parties have valid points. The mother isn't fulfilling her part, but the author didn't stick to the six-month promise. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the mother violated the terms, and the author has rights as a landlord, provided he follows the correct process. However, if he just kicks her out without legal steps, that could be an issue. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal actions. So overall, B makes sense.\n"
