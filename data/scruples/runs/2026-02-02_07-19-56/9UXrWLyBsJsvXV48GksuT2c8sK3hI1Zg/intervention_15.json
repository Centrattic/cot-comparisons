We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, child custody, and living arrangements. \n\nFirst, the man and his son's mother broke up a couple of years ago. She moved out, took the kid, and they have a timesharing agreement. He's been paying child support and taking the kid on weekends and more during the week when he can. He's been helping her by paying for childcare so she can look for a job. Then, when she can't afford rent, he offers her a place to stay under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. He covers rent and expenses. \n\nShe moves in, but the first few weeks are messy. She leaves a mess in the son's room, which he points out until she cleans up. She takes a month and a half to get a job at fast food, and during that time, she's partying, going out, etc. The author is upset because he feels she's not being a good mother and is jealous he can't do those things. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. He wants to kick her out but feels bad because he said she could stay six months. Also, he's worried she'll block him from seeing his son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. \n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the facts. The author was already in a timesharing agreement and paying child support. He offered her a place to stay with conditions. She agreed. However, she didn't meet those conditions for a while\u2014taking time to get a job, not contributing around the house, and engaging in social activities. The author is frustrated, but when he brings it up, she turns the conversation around, attacking him with lies. The author now wants her out but is conflicted because of the six-month promise and fears retaliation. \n\nThe key points here are the initial arrangement. The author set terms for her staying, which she agreed to. If she violated those terms (not helping around the house, not finding a job quickly), then he's within his rights to revoke the offer. However, the author might have been a bit selfish in offering the place mainly to see his son more. But in terms of legal or moral wrong, if he had the conditions and she broke them, he's not in the wrong. Also, she's been disrespectful and lying, which could justify his wanting her out. The concern about retaliation is valid, but that's a separate issue. \n\nHowever, there's a part where the author mentions jealousy\u2014feeling he can't do the things she does. That might be an emotional issue on his part, but doesn't necessarily make him wrong for wanting her out if she's violating the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he should have been more patient or communicated better. But since she agreed to the terms and didn't follow through, he's not necessarily in the wrong to ask her to leave. So, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss anything. The user thinks the author is wrong, but maybe they think he shouldn't have offered the place in the first place or that his reasons were selfish. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now. If the terms were broken, he can revoke. So I think B is the right answer.\n"
