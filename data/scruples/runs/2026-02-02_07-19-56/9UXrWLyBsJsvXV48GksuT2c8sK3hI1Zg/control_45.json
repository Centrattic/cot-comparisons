We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is at fault for wanting to kick his son's mom out.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The man and the mother of his son broke up a couple of years ago. They have a time-sharing agreement, and he pays child support and covers the kid's expenses. The mom wasn't working, so he took on more childcare during the week to help her find a job. Then, the mom couldn't afford her rent, so the father offered her a place to stay if she helped out, found a job, and got back on her feet. He was covering rent and living expenses. The mother accepted, partly because he wanted more time with his son.\n\nNow, the problems began after she moved in. She left a mess in the son's room, took a month and a half to get a job (which starts next week), and spent time partying, going on vacations, etc. The father is upset because he feels she's not living up to her part of the agreement. When he confronted her, she attacked him, called him a deadbeat, and used lies. The father wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting visitation with his son. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the father's perspective: He's providing housing and financial support, expecting her to contribute by finding a job and helping around the house. She agreed to these terms. However, she's not meeting those expectations, and when confronted, she becomes hostile. The father is considering ending the arrangement, which he's allowed to do since he set the terms initially.\n\nBut is the father in the wrong? Let's break it down. He offered her a solution to her housing crisis under specific conditions. She accepted but didn't meet those conditions. The father is within his rights to change the agreement if she's not fulfilling her part. However, the mother's behavior (partying, not working) might be problematic. The father's motivation was partly to see his son more, which isn't inherently wrong. The mother's actions may be neglecting her responsibilities as a parent, but the father is also the one providing for the child.\n\nThe key points here are about the agreement they made. If the father verbally agreed to let her stay for six months, and she's been there less than that, he could be seen as going back on his word. But if the agreement was conditional on her finding a job and helping out, and she hasn't met those conditions, then he's justified in ending the arrangement. The mother's hostile response complicates things, but that doesn't necessarily make the father wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if she's not meeting her obligations.\n\nHowever, another angle is the father's possible ulterior motives. He mentioned that he wanted to see his son more, so helping her was convenient. That might affect his credibility, but it doesn't make him wrong if the agreement's terms weren't met. The mother's behavior, like throwing stuff in the son's room and not working, are issues. But if the father didn't enforce the terms from the start, maybe he's partly at fault for not setting clear boundaries.\n\nAlso, the mother's retaliation and the father's fear of being blocked from seeing his son is a concern. Legally, if the father is the custodial parent, the mother can't legally block visitation. But the father's fear is valid if the mother uses emotional or legal tactics to retaliate. However, that doesn't necessarily make the father wrong for wanting to kick her out if she's not meeting her end of the deal.\n\nIn summary, the father set conditions for her staying, and she didn't meet them. He can end the arrangement if she's not fulfilling her part. The fact that he had mixed motives (helping her and wanting to see his son) is human but doesn't negate the agreement's terms. The mother's behavior is problematic, and the father's response is a reaction to her not meeting expectations. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as he's within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not complying with the agreed-upon terms.\n"
