We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to kick his son's mom out of his house.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user is a father who had a breakup with the mother of his child. They have a time-sharing agreement, and he's been paying child support, covering expenses, and trying to spend time with his son. The mother wasn't working, so he helped her move in under the condition that she finds a job and helps around the house. She agreed. But when she moved in, she didn't clean up, took a long time to get a job, partied, and now she's been disrespectful, attacking him when he brought up his concerns. The author is upset and wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mother didn't meet the agreed-upon conditions (finding a job, helping around the house), and the father is now considering kicking her out. But he's also concerned about her potential backlash. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if the mother agreed to certain conditions when moving in, and she's not fulfilling them, it's possible the father isn't in the wrong. However, the context is a personal arrangement, not a formal lease or legal agreement, which might complicate things. Also, the father's motives for allowing her to stay might be a factor\u2014partly for her benefit and partly to see his son more. But that's his prerogative.\n\nThe mother's behavior seems to be violating the understanding they had. She's not maintaining the household, isn't working consistently, and is acting disrespectfully. The father's concerns about her behavior affecting his son's environment could be valid, especially if he's worried about her parenting choices.\n\nHowever, the father should consider the legal implications. If the mother is still the custodial parent, removing her might affect custody arrangements. Also, if she retaliates by restricting his access, he might need to involve legal channels. But from a moral standpoint, if she's not meeting the agreed terms and is disrespectful, the father's desire to end the arrangement isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The father had a mutual agreement that the mother didn't uphold, and her disrespectful behavior justifies his decision. However, he should proceed carefully legally to avoid losing access to his son.\n"
