We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his ex have a son, and they broke up a couple of years ago. He's been helping her find a job, supporting him financially, covering childcare, and allowing her to stay at his house with the condition that she finds a job and helps around the house. Now, she's been slacking on finding a job, partying, and being disrespectful when he confronts her. He wants to kick her out but feels bad because he promised her six months.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He offered her a place to stay under certain conditions. That seems reasonable. He's been paying child support, covering expenses, and trying to help her get back on her feet. So his intentions were partly to help her and partly to see his son more. That's understandable. People have different motivations, but as long as the actions are legal and ethical, maybe that's okay.\n\nThen the problems: She didn't meet the conditions he set. She took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and didn't take care of the house. When he talks to her about it, she attacks him personally. That sounds like she's not fulfilling her end of the agreement, and her response is hostile. From the author's perspective, he's been a consistent support, while she's not holding up her side. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong to want to kick her out. The main issues here might be the terms of their agreement. He told her she could stay for six months. If it's been six months, he might be within his rights to ask her to leave. If not, maybe she's not in violation yet. However, maybe he can terminate the agreement earlier if she's violating the conditions. For example, if the agreement was that she needs to find a job and clean up, and she hasn't done that, he could have the right to end the arrangement early. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: He's upset about her behavior, which seems neglectful. But he's the one who allowed her to stay under certain conditions. If she's not meeting them, he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. However, there's the fear that she might try to take the child away. But legally, if the custody arrangement is set, she shouldn't be able to prevent his visitation unless there's a court order. So maybe his concern is valid, but he's not in the wrong for wanting to stand up for himself.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how he handled the situation. If he made an agreement for six months without a clause for early termination, maybe he's bound by that. However, if she's not fulfilling her part, maybe he can terminate it. It's a bit of a gray area. But since he's the one who set the conditions, and she's violating them, he's probably not in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: The author allowed her to stay for six months, but she's been there longer than that? Wait, the user says \"he told her she could stay here for six months\". If she's been there for six months, then he's just ending the agreement. If she hasn't been there that long, but he's giving her an ultimatum, maybe he's breaking the initial agreement. However, if the conditions she agreed to aren't being met, he might have the right to end it earlier. \n\nAlso, the emotional harm: She's been disrespectful, which is a valid reason to want to end the living arrangement. But he's the one who allowed her to stay with specific terms. If she's violating those terms, he's justified in wanting to end it. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He set conditions, she didn't meet them, and he wants to terminate the arrangement. So Answer B.\n"
