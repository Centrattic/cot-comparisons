We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick his son's mom out of his house. Let me start by understanding the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the ex-partner moved in after the author offered her a place to stay. His conditions were that she help around the house, find a job, and get back on her feet. The author mentions he did this partly to help her but mainly to spend more time with their son. So, the motivation is a mix of altruism and personal desire.\n\nNow, the ex didn't meet his expectations. She took over the son's room with her stuff, left a mess, took a month and a half to find a job, and spent time partying and going on vacations. The author feels she's not behaving like a responsible mother and is upset because he can't do those things. He tried to address her behavior, but she attacked him, calling him a deadbeat and using lies. This pattern of deflection when confronted is mentioned as not the first time.\n\nThe author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months. He's also worried about retaliation affecting his custody of the son.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex's behavior, the author's initial offer, and the conflict arising from her not meeting his expectations. Legally, if he owns the house, he can legally evict a tenant or guest, but if she's a tenant, he might need to follow proper procedures. However, the ethical question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to do so.\n\nThe author's offer was conditional on her finding a job and contributing. She didn't meet those conditions, so he might feel justified. However, he also wanted to see his son more, which is a personal desire. The ex's behavior (party life, disrespect) might not be his business if she's not under his care, but since she's living under his roof, he might expect her to maintain standards. The conflict arises from her not meeting his expectations and the verbal attacks.\n\nEthically, the author isn't necessarily wrong if he set conditions and she violated them. However, the power dynamic and the child's well-being are factors. He's providing a home and financial support; she's not contributing as agreed. The fact that she's being disrespectful and attacking him adds to his justification for wanting her out.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his own actions. He allowed her to stay under certain conditions, so if she's not meeting them, he's within his rights to ask her to leave. The question of whether he's in the wrong might depend on whether his conditions were reasonable and if he's given her a fair chance to meet them. The fact that she took a month and a half to find a job might be seen as slow, but it's possible she faced challenges. However, the author's own sacrifices (child support, childcare) are highlighted, which could support his position.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the agreement was mutual and she's not fulfilling her part, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the conditions were unrealistic or if he's using the situation to limit her time with the child for selfish reasons, that could be an issue. The custody arrangement's legality is separate, but the question is about moral wrong.\n\nThe answer likely is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as he provided a home under certain terms, and she didn't meet them, leading to his frustration and desire to end the arrangement. The fact that she's being disrespectful and not contributing as expected supports his position.\n"
