We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, his ex-partner, and their child. They broke up a couple of years ago, and the ex moved out with their son. The author has been paying child support and taking the kid as often as possible. Then, the ex couldn't afford rent, so the author offered her a place to stay under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. The ex accepted, but when she moved in, she didn't clean up her stuff for weeks, took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and the author feels upset. Then, when the author confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. Now, the author wants to kick her out but feels bad because he promised she could stay for six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects here. Legally, the author might have allowed her to stay with a verbal agreement, but without a formal contract, there's no legal obligation to let her stay. However, if there was a promise of six months, he might be bound by that unless there's a way out. But the user isn't asking about the law, just whether he's in the wrong morally.\n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated because he's working hard, taking care of the child, paying support, and the ex isn't contributing as he expected. He's upset about her behavior, like partying and neglecting chores. The ex, on the other hand, is defensive and attacks him when confronted. Her actions might indicate a lack of responsibility and respect, which the author is rightly upset about. However, the author's initial offer to let her stay might have been partly for his own convenience, which could come into play in the moral evaluation.\n\nThe author wants to kick her out because of her disrespect and the way she's acting. But he's also worried about retaliation affecting his access to the child. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual obligations. The author set conditions for her staying, which she didn't meet. If she violated those terms, he has the right to revoke the offer. However, the initial offer might have been a good-faith gesture, and ending it could be seen as breaking a promise, even if it's a verbal one. But if the terms were breached, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivations (50% to help her, 50% to see his son) might not be entirely selfless, but that doesn't make him wrong. People often have mixed motives. The ex's behavior\u2014partying, not working, not cleaning\u2014could be seen as irresponsible, which the author has a right to address. However, his jealousy about not being able to do those things himself might be a red flag. It's possible he's projecting his own frustrations into her actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author provided a home and support, but the ex isn't meeting her end of the deal. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he's handling it might be problematic. Ending the arrangement before the six months could be seen as breaking a verbal agreement, but if the terms were breached, it's a different story. The author's approach to confronting her might also be a factor. If he brought up issues calmly and she responded with attacks, that's a valid reason to reconsider the arrangement. However, the author might need to consider the impact on the child and ensure that his actions don't interfere with the child's well-being or the ex's ability to care for him.\n\nIn summary, the author has valid reasons to be upset about the ex not meeting the agreed terms and her disrespectful behavior. However, ending the agreement before the six months might be seen as breaking his word unless the terms were clearly violated. The mixed motives could affect the perception of his actions. The ex's behavior is a significant issue, but the author should also reflect on whether his expectations were reasonable and whether communication could have been improved. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if the ex breached the agreement, but there are nuances to consider.\n"
