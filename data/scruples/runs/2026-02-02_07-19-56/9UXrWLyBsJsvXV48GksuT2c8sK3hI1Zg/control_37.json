We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's letting his ex live with him after their breakup. They have a son, and the ex is supposed to get back on her feet by finding a job. The author allowed her to stay in exchange for helping out and finding a job. But he's frustrated because she's not working as hard as he thinks she should, and she's partying a lot. He also feels she's being disrespectful when he brings up his concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. The author is not her landlord, right? He's letting her stay in his house. So if he wants to kick her out, he has to follow proper procedures. But since it's his house, maybe he can just ask her to leave? But he did promise her six months. However, if she's not meeting the agreed terms (like helping around the house, finding a job), maybe he has grounds to end the arrangement early. \n\nThen there's the custody aspect. The ex is the child's mother, and the author has a time-sharing agreement. If he kicks her out, there might be legal issues about the child's custody. The author is worried that she might use this as a reason to try to block his visitation. So he has to be careful not to jeopardize his access to his son.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels he's been sacrificing a lot, paying child support, covering expenses, and working hard. The ex, on the other hand, hasn't been working steadily and is engaging in what he sees as irresponsible behavior. The author is upset because he's trying to do the right thing, and she's not holding up her end of the informal agreement. But when he confronts her, she attacks him, which he finds hurtful.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did offer her a place to stay with conditions. If she's not meeting those conditions, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. However, he has to consider the legal implications, especially regarding the child. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nHe might be responsible for the child's well-being, so if kicking her out would harm the son, that's a consideration. But if she's not taking her responsibilities as a mother seriously, maybe it's better for the child to be away from that environment. The author is trying to balance his own needs and the child's needs here.\n\nThe ex's behavior\u2014partying, not working, being disrespectful\u2014could be seen as neglecting her role as a parent. The author is trying to hold her accountable, which might be justified. However, the author's own motivations for allowing her to stay were partly selfish (to see his son more), so maybe that's a point against him. But he still followed through by offering support in exchange for her meeting certain responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at who's being unfair or not standing by their word. The author gave her a chance under certain conditions. If she's not fulfilling them, then he's not the one at fault. The ex is the one not holding up her end, and when confronted, she blames him instead of addressing her own issues. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if she's not meeting the terms he agreed upon.\n"
