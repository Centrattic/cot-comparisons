We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, a custody arrangement, and the mother moving in with the father to stay out of debt. The father allowed her to live there under certain conditions, but she's not meeting them and is partying instead. He's upset and wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he made a promise and fears losing custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the person is asking about being in the wrong, maybe they're concerned about legal repercussions. The father has a child custody arrangement, and the mother moved in without a formal agreement. If the father wants to evict her, he might need a legal process. But since they're not married, his house isn't necessarily her legal residence. However, if she's there under a lease or verbal agreement, there might be some obligations. But the original arrangement was for her to help with chores and find a job, which she's not doing. He might have the legal right to ask her to leave if the conditions aren't met, depending on local laws.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The father is helping her financially because he wants to see his son more, which might be self-serving. The mother is using his resources without contributing as agreed. She's also acting disrespectfully and lying about him. The user's conflict is whether his desire to protect his son's environment and his own well-being justifies kicking her out. From an ethical standpoint, if someone isn't fulfilling their part of an agreement and is behaving irresponsibly, the other party might have a right to reconsider the arrangement.\n\nEmotional aspects are also at play. The father feels jealousy when she parties, which might affect his judgment. The mother's deflection and insults could be a pattern, making him feel undervalued. His sacrifice and hard work might be valid, but he needs to handle the situation constructively. However, his reasons for allowing her to stay initially were partially self-serving, which complicates the moral stance.\n\nLegal implications regarding child custody are crucial. If the mother moves out, could she use that as a reason to restrict visitation? The father's priority should be his son's best interest. If the mother's behavior is harmful to the child, he might have a stronger case. But if she's just being irresponsible, he needs to ensure that his actions don't interfere with the child's relationship with the mother, unless it's detrimental.\n\nIn summary, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's fulfilling his part of the agreement, and the mother is not meeting her responsibilities. However, he needs to approach the situation carefully, possibly with legal advice, to avoid jeopardizing his custody rights. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, but he should handle the eviction properly to prevent legal issues.\n"
