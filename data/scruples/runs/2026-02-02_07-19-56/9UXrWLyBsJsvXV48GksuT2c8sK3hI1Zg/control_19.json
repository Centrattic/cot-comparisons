We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for wanting to kick their son's mom out of their house. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The ex-partner (let's call them Ex) and the author had a breakup a couple of years ago. The ex moved out, took the son, and they had a time-sharing agreement. The author has been active in their son's life, covering expenses, paying child support, and taking more days during the week to help the ex find a job. Then, when the ex couldn't afford rent, the author offered her a place to stay under certain conditions: helping out, finding a job, etc. The ex agreed, and the author covered all living expenses and childcare.\n\nNow, the problems started after she moved in. She was messy, took a long time to get a job, partied a lot, and when confronted, she lashed out with insults and lies. The author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because they promised six months. Also, they're worried about retaliation affecting their time with the son.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author had a prior agreement to help the ex get back on her feet in exchange for her moving in, but the ex isn't meeting those terms. The author is upset with her behavior and the disrespect. The ex is acting defensively and attacking the author when criticized. The author is considering ending the arrangement early.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they made a personal agreement, not a legal one, so they can change their mind. The ex isn't fulfilling her part of the deal. The author is within their rights to revoke the offer since it's a private agreement. However, there might be emotional aspects. The author's jealousy about the ex's social life and the ex's behavior could be a conflict of interest. But legally, if the arrangement was verbal and not court-ordered, the author can decide to end it. The ex's actions (partying, not working) might be valid reasons for the author to feel they can't continue. The author isn't obligated to keep the ex there if the terms aren't met. The ex's response of attacking the author is problematic, but the author's main issue is the ex not meeting the conditions they set. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. But maybe there's a nuance. If the son's well-being is a factor, but the author is still seeing him as per the agreement. Also, the author's own jealousy might affect their judgment, but they're not in the wrong for wanting to end a non-binding agreement. So, probably answer B (No).\n"
