We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and the ex-girlfriend (not Karen) broke up, and they have a time-sharing agreement. The ex isn't working, so the author takes the kid more during the week, covers childcare, and pays child support. Then, the ex can't afford rent, so the author offers her a place to stay under conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, etc. The author's main reason is to see the kid more, but they also help her. \n\nThe ex moves in but the first few weeks are messy. She leaves stuff in the kid's room, takes a month and a half to get a job, parties, goes to festivals, vacations, etc. The author confronts her, but she attacks back, calling them a deadbeat and lying. The author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because they said she could stay six months and fears retaliation over custody.\n\nNow, considering the facts, the author's actions: They offered shelter under specific conditions. The ex didn't meet those conditions\u2014taking too long to get a job, being unhelpful around the house, and engaging in recreational activities. The author had the right to set terms when offering the arrangement. The ex's behavior, especially the disrespectful response and not fulfilling the agreed conditions, could justify the author wanting to end the arrangement.\n\nHowever, the author's motivations might be mixed. They admitted that part of the reason for the offer was to see the child more. That's understandable, but it's also their right. The main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement given the ex's non-compliance. Since the ex violated the conditions (job search, helping out) and was disrespectful, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to leave her out. The fear of retaliation is valid but doesn't equate to the author being at fault. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
