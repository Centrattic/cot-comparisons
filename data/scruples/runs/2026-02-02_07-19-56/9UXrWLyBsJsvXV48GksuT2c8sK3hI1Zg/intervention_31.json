We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a father who allowed the mother of his child to move in with him to help her get back on her feet, but now he wants to kick her out because of her behavior.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he took in the mother (not Karen) because he wanted to see his son more, and he also wanted to help her. He set conditions like her helping around the house, finding a job, etc. She agreed. But then she didn't clean up her stuff immediately, took a long time to get a job, and partied a lot. He's upset about her behavior and feels she's not living up to her end of the deal. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and being disrespectful. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about legal repercussions affecting his time with his son.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's initial offer to take her in under certain conditions, her failure to meet those conditions, and his frustration leading to wanting to remove her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to assess if the author acted wrongly. He did offer her a chance to stay under specific terms. If she didn't meet those terms, then he might have a valid reason to kick her out, especially if there was an agreement. However, if he made an informal agreement without a formal contract, it could complicate things legally. Also, his motives were partly to see his son more, which might not be a bad reason, but if he didn't make the conditions clear from the start, that could be an issue.\n\nThe mother's behavior (not cleaning up, not getting a job quickly, partying) could be seen as not fulfilling her part. However, the author might have been too lenient initially, allowing her to stay even when she wasn't meeting the conditions. On the other hand, he did provide her with a place to stay and covered expenses, which is a big help. The fact that she became defensive and attacked him when he raised concerns might justify his desire to end the arrangement.\n\nLegally, if this is a landlord-tenant situation, the author might have to follow proper procedures to evict her, especially if there's no written agreement. But emotionally, his frustration is understandable given the circumstances. The AITA aspect often considers both legal and moral angles. If the author had a clear agreement and she violated it, then he's not in the wrong. If the agreement was more informal, then it's a bit murkier, but he might still have a valid reason.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he set conditions, she didn't meet them, and he's trying to address the situation. His motives were mixed, but the outcome is based on her not fulfilling her part of the deal.\n"
