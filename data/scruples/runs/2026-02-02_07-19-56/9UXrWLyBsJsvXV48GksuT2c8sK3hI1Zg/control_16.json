We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their ex out. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the ex moved in because she couldn't afford rent and the author offered help. The author had conditions like helping around the house, finding a job, etc. The ex took a month and a half to find a job, partied a lot, and the author is upset. Then when the author brings it up, the ex attacks them, calling them a deadbeat with lies.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. The author is providing a place to stay, covering expenses, but the ex isn't meeting the conditions they agreed to. The author feels disrespected and is worried about retaliation affecting their time with the son.\n\nLegal aspects: Since it's a living arrangement, even if it's informal, there might be legal implications. If the author has a lease, they can't just kick someone out without following proper procedures. But if the ex is a tenant, the author might need to follow eviction processes. Also, child custody and visitation rights could be affected if the ex uses this as a leverage. But the author is following the same time-sharing agreement, so maybe the ex's presence isn't affecting that.\n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed from work, trying to support their son, and feels the ex isn't pulling her weight. The ex's behavior could be seen as irresponsible, but attacking the author isn't helpful. However, the author's desire to kick her out might be based on personal frustration, not just the ex's actions.\n\nMoral perspective: The author helped the ex when she was in need, expecting certain responsibilities. If the ex isn't fulfilling her part, the author has a right to reassess the arrangement. But since the author initially offered help with a time frame (six months), maybe they should stick to that unless there's a breach of agreement.\n\nThe key points are the conditions of the agreement, whether the ex violated them, and the author's right to enforce those terms. The author might not be in the wrong if the ex isn't adhering to the initial conditions. However, the author should consider legal steps rather than just kicking her out. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation needs careful handling.\n"
