We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and the ex broke up, had a time-sharing agreement. The ex wasn't working, so the author took more time with the kid and paid for childcare to help her find a job. The ex moved in to the author's house when she couldn't afford rent. The author offered this partly to help her and partly to see their son more. \n\nNow, the ex is not cleaning up, taking a month and a half to find a job, partying, and being disrespectful. The author wants to kick her out because of her behavior and the conflict. The ex might retaliate by affecting the time-sharing agreement.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's main points: They've been paying child support, working full-time, covering expenses. The ex moved in under the condition to find a job and help around the house. She's not fulfilling those terms. The author is upset about her behavior and the disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex is in a vulnerable position, unemployed, and maybe struggling. The author's motivation for letting her stay wasn't entirely altruistic\u2014they wanted more time with the kid. The ex is reacting defensively when confronted, which might be a result of stress or her own issues. The author's desire to kick her out is understandable, but maybe they should have considered better communication or legal advice first.\n\nBut the author is also in a position where they might be violating the original agreement if they kick her out without cause. Also, the ex might use this as leverage in custody issues. The author's jealousy about not having time to party could be a personal issue, but the ex's behavior is indeed concerning for a mother.\n\nWait, the author's main issue is that the ex isn't adhering to the terms they agreed upon when she moved in. So, if she agreed to find a job and help with chores, and isn't doing that, then the author has grounds to ask her to leave. However, the author's initial offer wasn't formalized legally, maybe just a verbal agreement. So if they didn't put it in writing, it's hard to enforce. Also, the author's own behavior\u2014maybe being confrontational\u2014might have escalated the situation. The ex's insults could be a reaction to the author bringing up issues.\n\nBut the author is also trying to do what's right for the child. However, if the ex is being neglectful as a parent, that's a problem. But the author's approach might not be the best\u2014threatening to kick her out could affect the child's well-being. Maybe the author should involve a mediator or legal system instead of handling it on their own.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be justified in wanting to enforce the terms of their agreement. However, their mixed motives (partly self-serving) and the potential negative impact on the child's custody could be problems. The ex's behavior is definitely concerning, but the author's approach might not be the healthiest. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to hold the ex accountable to the terms she agreed to. However, their approach could be flawed. The key is whether the original agreement was clear and if there are legal implications. If the author can show that the ex isn't meeting the conditions they agreed upon when moving in, then they might have a case. But if it's just a verbal agreement without legal backing, the author's ability to enforce it is limited. Also, the author's personal feelings (jealousy) might be affecting their judgment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to enforce the agreement, but they might need to go through proper channels instead of just trying to kick her out. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but with caveats about handling it legally.\n"
