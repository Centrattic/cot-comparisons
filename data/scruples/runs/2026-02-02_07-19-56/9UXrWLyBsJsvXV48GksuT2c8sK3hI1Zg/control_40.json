We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a break-up between the author and the mother of his son. After the split, they had a time-sharing agreement, and he was helping her find a job by covering childcare and taking more days so she could work. Now, she's living with him under the condition that she helps around the house, gets a job, and focuses on her life. But she hasn't lived up to his expectations, leaving a mess, taking time for parties and other things, and when he confronts her, she becomes hostile and accuses him of being a deadbeat. The author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He offered her a place to stay with the stipulations of helping out, finding a job, etc. He's been paying child support, working full-time, and covering all his son's expenses. So from his perspective, he's helping her out, which allows him to see his son more. That's a common motivation after a breakup, wanting more time with the child. But the problem arises when she doesn't meet his expectations. \n\nHe mentions that she threw her stuff in the son's room and left it messy, which he had to address. Then he's upset that she took a month and a half to get a job, partying and going on vacations. He's concerned about her being a bad mother and feels jealous because she's doing things he can't. When he talks to her, she gets defensive and insults him. The author wants to remove her from his home but is worried about legal repercussions regarding child custody.\n\nNow, considering the legal angle. In many places, a parent's rights to their child are protected, and removing the other parent from the home could lead to legal issues. The author allowed her to stay under certain conditions, but if those conditions aren't part of a formal legal agreement, he might have no legal standing to remove her. Also, if she's the legal custodian, he can't just kick her out without risking losing access to his son.\n\nEmotionally, the author is struggling with his own sacrifices and the imbalance he perceives. He might feel resentful because he's shouldering the financial burden and the responsibility for the child, while she's not contributing as he expects. However, his initial offer to let her stay might have been a personal arrangement rather than a binding agreement. His jealousy is a red flag, suggesting his motivations might be mixed. He's not just helping her out but also trying to have more time with the child.\n\nThe mother's behavior is problematic. Leaving a mess in the child's room, taking long to find a job, and prioritizing her social life over responsibilities could indicate neglect. However, the author's reaction of wanting to kick her out might be a way to control the situation or punish her, rather than addressing the child's needs. If he's the one covering all expenses and she's not contributing, that could be a point. But legally, he can't just evict her without proper process, especially if she's the custodial parent.\n\nAlso, the way he approached her\u2014bothering her about the mess and her job search\u2014might have been confrontational, leading to her defensiveness. If he made her feel blamed, her response could be a reaction to that. The author's own actions in the past (like the time-sharing agreement) might have set up a situation where he's enabling her financially, which could be seen as his own issue.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to do the right thing by helping her get back on her feet and ensuring the child's well-being. But if her behavior is harmful to the child or the household, he might have a valid concern. However, the key here is that the mother is the custodial parent, and the author might be overstepping by wanting to remove her from the home for his own grievances, especially if it's not in the child's best interest. \n\nThe author's guilt is about not fulfilling the six-month promise. But if her actions are detrimental, maybe it's necessary to end the arrangement. However, the way he's handling it (wanting to retaliate) could backfire legally. He should consider legal steps, maybe mediation, rather than just kicking her out. \n\nSo, the answer is tricky. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially if those boundaries were part of the agreement. But the way he's handling it (threatening to retaliate without legal grounds) might be problematic. The main question is whether the mother's actions are neglectful or if the author is overreacting. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because he's trying to enforce an agreement he made and has legitimate concerns about her behavior affecting the child. But he needs to handle it through proper channels to avoid legal issues.\n"
