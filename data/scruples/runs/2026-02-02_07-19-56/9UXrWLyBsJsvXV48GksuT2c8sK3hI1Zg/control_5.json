We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call him Dad) and his ex (Mom) broke up a couple of years ago. The kid lives with Mom, but Dad has time-sharing, especially weekends. He took more days during the week when she wasn't working, paid for childcare so she could find a job. He's been consistent with child support and covering the kid's expenses. That part seems responsible.\n\nThen, when Mom couldn't afford her rent, Dad offered her to stay at his place under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. He says he did this partly to help her but mainly to see his son more. She agreed. So he's providing a place for her, covering rent and living expenses, childcare. But she's been messy, took a month and a half to get a job, and partied a lot. He's upset she's not a good role model and feels jealous because he can't do those things. When he brings it up, she attacks him, calls him a deadbeat with lies, which hurt him. Now he wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he told her she could stay for six months. Also worried she might retaliate by keeping him from his son.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nDad's actions: He offered her a place to stay with conditions. She agreed. If she's not meeting those conditions, maybe he's justified in ending the arrangement. However, he's using it as a way to see his son more, which is a bit self-serving. But he's still providing support. On the other hand, she's not fulfilling her end\u2014taking too long to get a job, being messy, parting. He's frustrated, which is understandable.\n\nHer actions: She's violating the conditions he set. Not getting a job quickly, not maintaining the house, not being a good role model. When confronted, she becomes hostile and lies. That's definitely problematic.\n\nLegal aspects: He's not her landlord, so he can't just kick her out without a lease or legal agreement. Since he offered her a place under certain terms, if she's violating them, he might have grounds to end the arrangement. But if there's no formal agreement, it's more of a verbal agreement, which can be tricky. Also, if she's staying with him under some sort of agreement, he might need to follow proper procedures to evict her, otherwise it could lead to legal issues.\n\nEmotional aspects: He's working hard, trying to support the kid, and feels unappreciated. Her behavior is disrespectful and uncooperative. His jealousy about not having time to do the things she does might be a factor, but that's more personal.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong: Did he do something wrong? He offered a deal, she agreed, and now he wants to end it because she's not meeting her part. He's not in the wrong for wanting to do that. However, he might need to proceed carefully to avoid legal problems and ensure his access to the child isn't affected. Also, his reasons for allowing her to stay partly for more time with the child could be seen as a bit manipulative, but that's more on his side.\n\nThe key points: She's not adhering to the conditions he set, and he's justified in wanting to end the arrangement. He's not in the wrong for that. However, he needs to handle it properly. The answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
