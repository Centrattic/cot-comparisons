We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a father who had a breakup with the mother of his son. After the breakup, the mother moved out and the child stayed with her. They had a time-sharing agreement where the father saw the kid on weekends. The mother wasn't working, so the father took more days during the week, paid for childcare to help her find a job. He's been consistent with child support and covering the child's expenses.\n\nThen, the mother couldn't afford her rent, so the father offered her to stay in his house under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. She agreed. But the author mentions that part of his motivation was to see his son more, not just to help her. \n\nAfter she moved in, things didn't go well. She left a mess, took over the son's room, and was slow to get a job, taking a month and a half. She spent time partying, going on vacations, etc. The father feels this is inappropriate behavior for a mother and is also jealous because he can't do those things due to his work schedule. He confronted her, but she attacked him, calling him a deadbeat and spreading lies, which hurt him. He now wants to kick her out but is worried about repercussions regarding child custody.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and is asking for my opinion. The options are A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's look at the father's actions. He offered the mother a place to stay with conditions. She agreed. So, there was an agreement. The father's initial support (covering childcare, child support) was appropriate. However, when he offered her living arrangements, maybe there was an assumption or agreement about her responsibilities. The mother didn't meet those expectations\u2014left a mess, was slow to find a job, and partied. The father's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the father's own admission that part of his reason for letting her stay was to see his son more might complicate things. If he had mixed motives, that could affect the perception of fairness. However, wanting to see your child more isn't inherently wrong, but if the conditions were solely for his benefit, it might be a point of contention.\n\nThe mother's behavior after moving in was problematic. Not contributing around the house, taking time to find a job, and engaging in leisure activities while the father is working could be seen as not fulfilling her part of the agreement. The father's frustration in bringing this up is valid. However, when he confronted her, she responded with personal attacks and lies. That's a red flag. Her behavior was disrespectful and could be seen as manipulative, especially if she's spreading false accusations about him being a deadbeat.\n\nNow, the father wants to kick her out. But he feels bad because he told her she could stay for six months. However, if the agreement was conditional on her helping out and finding a job, and she didn't meet those conditions, then he might have grounds to ask her to leave. The problem is whether there was a formal agreement about the duration. The father mentions he told her she could stay for six months, so if she's been there less than that, he might be bound by his own agreement. But if she wasn't meeting the conditions from the start, maybe he can break that agreement earlier. However, without a written agreement, it's more of a verbal understanding, which can be tricky.\n\nThe father's jealousy about not being able to party or go on vacations is a bit of a personal issue. It's not about his son's well-being but his own lifestyle. That could be a point where his judgment is clouded. He might be projecting his own feelings onto her behavior, thinking that her actions are inappropriate for a mother, but maybe there's no clear right or wrong there. However, if she's neglecting her responsibilities (like childcare or job search) because of these activities, that's another matter.\n\nThe mother's response to his concerns by attacking him is definitely wrong. She's using manipulative tactics, which could indicate a pattern of behavior. The father's decision to confront her about the issues is reasonable, but her response made the situation worse. \n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. He's frustrated with her not meeting the conditions he set, and he's considering asking her to leave. If the agreement was clear and she violated it, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the agreement wasn't formal or if he had mixed motives, it might be more nuanced. But in this case, the key points are that he offered her a place under certain conditions, she didn't meet them, and she responded disrespectfully. The father's actions to address the situation are within his rights. The mother's behavior is the main issue here, not the father's.\n\nHe might be in the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not fulfilling her part of the agreement. The fact that he's worried about her retaliating by trying to limit his access to his son is a real concern, but that's more about how the legal system might view things if this goes to court. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the father isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the mother's behavior and hold her accountable. The mother's actions were the root of the problem. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
