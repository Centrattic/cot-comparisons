We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between the author and the mother of his son. After the breakup, the mother moved out, and they had a time-sharing agreement. The author took on more childcare responsibilities to help her find a job. Later, the mother couldn't afford her rent, so she moved in with the author under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and stops smoking weed. The author was partly motivated by wanting to see his son more.\n\nNow, the problems start. The mother initially makes a mess, takes time to get a job, and parties a lot. The author confronts her, but she responds with insults and lies. The author wants to kick her out but feels bad because he promised six months. He's also worried about her retaliating to affect his access to his son.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at his actions. He allowed her to stay under certain conditions. She didn't meet them promptly, but after a month and a half, she got a job. The author might be frustrated with her behavior, but is it fair to kick her out mid-agreement? Also, the author's motivations were partially selfish (seeing his son more), which could imply he didn't just help her altruistically. However, the mother's actions\u2014partying, neglecting responsibilities, being disrespectful\u2014are also problematic.\n\nThe key points are the conditions of her staying and whether she violated them. The author set up conditions, and she failed to meet some initially but eventually got a job. The author might be within his rights to end the arrangement if she breached the agreement, but since he offered six months and she's only been there for a portion of that, maybe he should follow through unless there's a valid reason to end it early. However, the mother's disrespectful behavior and lies could be just cause for her to leave. \n\nAlso, the author's jealousy about her partying while he's working could be a red flag. But the mother's actions do violate the conditions. The author might have a valid reason to ask her to leave, especially if she's not pulling her weight and is disrespectful. However, the initial agreement's terms matter. If he agreed to six months without a clause for early termination, then he might be the asshole for breaking the agreement unless she violated it. \n\nBut since she did violate the conditions (lazy job search, partying), the author might have grounds to end the arrangement. However, the way he's handling it\u2014feeling jealous and upset by her lifestyle\u2014could imply his own issues. The mother's response with insults and lies is also unproductive, but the author's desire to eject her after only a few months might be premature unless she's fully breached the agreement. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's allowed her to stay under conditions she hasn't fully met, but he's also using his own selfish motives, maybe he's partially at fault. However, if she's actively violating the terms and being disrespectful, then he's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he's using his son's mother's situation to benefit himself and is now frustrated with her behavior, but also not considering the agreement's terms, perhaps he is the asshole. However, the mother's behavior is also bad. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B because the author has valid reasons to ask her to leave due to her violations.\n"
