We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. They want to know if their situation justifies wanting to kick the ex-partner out of their house.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parent (the author) and the ex (son's mom) broke up a couple of years ago. They have a time-sharing agreement, and the author has been taking the son more often during the week, paying for childcare so the ex could look for a job. The author has consistently paid child support and covered expenses.\n\nThen, the ex couldn't afford rent, and the author offered her a place to stay under certain conditions: helping out around the house, finding a job, and covering her living expenses. The ex agreed. The author's main motivation might have been wanting more time with the son, but helped her financially too.\n\nAfter the ex moved in, there were issues. She was messy with their son's room, took a month and a half to get a job, and spent time partying, going to festivals, vacations, and visiting boyfriends. The author feels she's not acting responsibly as a mother and is upset because the author can't do those things. The author confronts her, but she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. This has happened before, and the author now wants to kick her out but feels bad because he promised six months. He's also worried about retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author helped the ex by offering a place to stay, which is generous. However, the ex didn't meet the conditions she agreed to. She didn't help with housework, took a long time to find a job, and engaged in partying. The author's frustration is understandable. But when he confronted her, she retaliated with lies and attacks. The author might feel justified in wanting her out because she's not respecting the agreement and is being disrespectful. However, the author did agree to a six-month stay, which is a commitment. Ending it early could be seen as breaking that commitment unless there's a valid reason. \n\nThe ex's behavior is problematic. She didn't fulfill her part of the deal, which the author had conditions for allowing her to stay. The author's concerns about the ex's priorities (partying vs. childcare) are valid from a parental standpoint. However, the author's motivation for the arrangement might be partly self-serving (more time with the child), which could affect their judgment. \n\nThe key points are whether the author had a right to set conditions for her stay and if she violated them. If the author allowed her to stay with the understanding of certain responsibilities, and she didn't meet them, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her to leave. However, the author might need to consider the legal implications of evicting someone, especially if they're not on a lease or formal agreement. Also, the fear of the ex retaliating by limiting access to the child is a real concern, suggesting that the author should proceed carefully, perhaps through legal channels.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author helped the ex when she was in need, but the ex didn't fulfill her part. The author's frustration is justified, but the way he's handling it (wanting to kick her out) might need to consider both the agreement's terms and the potential consequences. Since the author is the one who set the conditions and she didn't meet them, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the initial agreement wasn't formalized, there might be complications. Still, the main issue is the ex's behavior violating the mutual understanding.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he provided a living situation with conditions that she didn't meet, leading to his justified frustration. The ex's actions and disrespectful behavior contribute to the problem, so the author isn't entirely at fault here.\n"
