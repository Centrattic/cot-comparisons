We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a father who allowed the mother of his child to stay in his house in exchange for her helping out, getting a job, and contributing. The mother started staying at her boyfriend's, partying, and not taking the job search seriously. When the father confronts her, she attacks him with untrue accusations, leading him to want to kick her out. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The father allowed the mother to stay under certain conditions. She agreed to these terms. However, she's not meeting them, which is causing conflict. The father is frustrated with her behavior and the mother's response is attacking him. \n\nI should consider the legal aspects. Even though they're not married, the father is still the legal parent, and the mother has visitation rights. By letting her stay in his house, there's a living arrangement that might need to be formalized. If she's there to help take care of the child, but isn't fulfilling her part, he might have grounds to ask her to leave, especially if the arrangement was verbal and she's violating the agreed terms.\n\nBut there's also the emotional component. The father's jealousy and frustration about not being able to do the same things she does. The mother's behavior being irresponsible and disrespectful. The father feeling hurt by her false accusations. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the father had a verbal agreement. The mother didn't meet her obligations, and when confronted, she became hostile. The father's desire to kick her out is understandable if the arrangement was based on mutual responsibilities that she's not fulfilling. However, the father's initial motivation (wanting to see his son more) might be seen as a personal gain, but that doesn't necessarily make the current situation wrong if the terms weren't met.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Possible reasons could be that the father set the terms and she broke them, so he's justified in asking her to leave. Alternatively, if the arrangement wasn't formal, maybe he's overstepping by wanting to kick her out. But since he's the one who set the conditions, he has the right to enforce them.\n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest. If the mother's presence is causing stress or instability, removing her might be in the child's best interest. However, the father needs to ensure that he doesn't interfere with the mother's custody rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's actions might be justified if the mother violated the agreed terms. Since the arrangement was verbal and the father set the conditions, he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end it. The mother's behavior is disrespectful, and the father has the right to enforce the terms he laid out.\n"
