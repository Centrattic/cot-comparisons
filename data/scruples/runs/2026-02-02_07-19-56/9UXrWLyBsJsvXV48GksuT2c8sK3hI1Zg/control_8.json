We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to kick his son's mother out of his house. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the former couple has a time-sharing agreement. The father has been paying child support, covering expenses, and taking care of the child during the week so the mother can look for work. She moved in with him to get back on her feet but hasn't been proactive. She's been partying, not finding a job quickly, and treating his house as her own. When he confronts her, she attacks him instead of addressing the issues. Now he's considering kicking her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. He offered her a place to stay with conditions, expecting her to find a job and contribute. She agreed but didn't meet his expectations. He's frustrated with her behavior and the disrespect. On the other hand, he allowed her to stay without a formal agreement, which might complicate things legally. Also, his partial motivation for letting her stay was to see his son more, which might not be entirely altruistic. However, her actions (partying, not working) are problematic. The mother's response to confrontation is aggressive, which adds to the father's justification for wanting her out. Legally, unless there's a formal agreement, he can probably evict her, but he needs to be cautious about her possibly using the child access as leverage. Ethically, while he's not perfect for initial intentions, her behavior is inexcusable. So, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. His actions are within his rights and he has valid reasons for wanting her out given her behavior and the lack of a binding agreement.\n"
