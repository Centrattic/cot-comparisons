We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-partner, the mother of their child, who moved in after the breakup to get back on her feet. The writer is considering kicking her out due to her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The mother moved in after the breakup, and the father offered her a place with certain conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, etc. She eventually got a job after a month and a half, and during that time, she was engaging in activities like partying and going on vacations. The father feels upset because he's working hard, not seeing his son as much as he wants, and feels disrespected by her behavior. She also attacked him emotionally when he brought up his concerns.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the father is in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if they're in a shared custody arrangement, the father might have some rights regarding where the child stays. However, the mother's living situation could affect visitation rights. If she moves out, does that impact the child's time with the father? It's possible she might try to use that against him in custody matters, but the father's main issue is with her behavior in his home.\n\nEthically, the father provided lodging with conditions. She didn't meet the conditions as quickly as he wanted, but she did eventually get a job. The mess in the son's room and her social activities might be seen as disrespectful, but they don't necessarily violate the terms of their agreement unless there were explicit rules about that. The father's jealousy and emotional hurt are valid feelings, but they might not justify wanting to kick her out, especially if he initially agreed to let her stay for six months.\n\nHe agreed to let her stay for six months, and now wants to kick her out earlier. That could be seen as breaking his word. Also, using her as a way to see his son more might complicate things. If he kicks her out, she could potentially challenge his visitation rights, which could be a legal risk. The father's actions, while understandable given the stress, might not be justified if he's breaking an agreement without a valid reason.\n\nHowever, there's a point where someone's living arrangements can affect a child's well-being. If the mother is not fulfilling her parental duties (like maintaining a stable environment), the father might have a case. But the post doesn't mention the child being harmed directly, just the father's feelings about the situation.\n\nIn summary, the father provided a temporary living arrangement with conditions. The mother didn't meet the job requirement quickly but did eventually. Her behavior might be annoying, but unless there were specific terms about her conduct, the father's desire to kick her out based on personal grievances (like jealousy) and unkept promises (the six-month agreement) might make him the one in the wrong.\n"
