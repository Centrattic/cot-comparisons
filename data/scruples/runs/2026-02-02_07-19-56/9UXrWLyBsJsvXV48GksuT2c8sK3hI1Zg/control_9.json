We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his ex-wife broke up, and she moved out with their son. They have a time-sharing agreement. The author is paying child support, taking care of the kid's expenses, and even helping her by letting her stay at his house so she can get a job. But when she moves in, things go south. She doesn't clean up her stuff, takes a long time to get a job, and parties a lot. The author confronts her, and she attacks him. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. He offered her a place to stay with conditions: helping around the house, finding a job. She agreed. But she didn't meet those conditions well. She left a mess, took a month and a half to find a job, and partied. The author's main motivation was partly to help her, partly to see his son more. He provided financial support and childcare. \n\nThen there's the conflict. When he confronts her about her behavior, she attacks him with insults and lies. He's hurt because he feels he's sacrificed a lot. He wants to kick her out but feels bound by the six-month commitment. Also, fears she might retaliate over custody.\n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if they had an informal agreement for her to stay six months, he might be bound by that. But if he's not a landlord, maybe he can ask her to leave. Ethically, he's providing a home as a favor, but she's not meeting the agreed terms. She's also a mother, so there's a responsibility to act in the child's best interest.\n\nShe took his son and moved out, which might imply primary custody. Now she's living with him again. Her lifestyle choices (partying, not working) could be concerning for the child's environment. However, the author's jealousy about not being able to do those things complicates things. His main issue is her behavior affecting his time with the son, but he's also upset about her actions reflecting poorly as a mother.\n\nHe hasn't done anything illegal, but perhaps acted out of self-interest. He's paying for everything, but maybe overstepped by controlling her job search or activities. However, since he's the one providing the home, he might have the right to set boundaries. \n\nShe violated the agreed terms, and her response was aggressive. The author's wanting to end the arrangement might be justified, but he's concerned about her retaliating in custody matters. The key points are whether he breached their agreement (he didn't, since she agreed to conditions) and if his actions are in the best interest of the child.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He provided a home with conditions, she didn't meet them, and he wants to end the arrangement. His feelings of jealousy might cloud his judgment, but legally and ethically, he's not wrong. She's the one being disrespectful and not meeting her end. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
