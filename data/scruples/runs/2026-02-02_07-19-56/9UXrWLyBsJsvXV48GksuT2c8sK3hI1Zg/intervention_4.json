We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to kick out their ex-partner, the mother of their child, after she moved in under a certain agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation to understand the key points. The ex and the author broke up a couple of years ago, and they have a time-sharing agreement where the author has the son on weekends and some weekdays. The mom wasn't working, so the author helped by covering childcare so she could look for a job. The author was paying all the child's expenses and never missed child support. Then, when the mom couldn't pay rent, the author offered her a place to stay on the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. The mom agreed. The author's main motivation was partly helping her but mainly to see the son more. \n\nNow, after a few weeks, the mom is messy, takes a month and a half to get a job, and the author feels she's not doing her part. The mom is partying, going to festivals, staying at a boyfriend's, etc. When the author confronts her, she attacks him with insults and lies. The author is considering kicking her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay for six months. He's also worried she might try to block his access to the son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the terms of their agreement. The author offered the mom a place to stay with conditions. The mom agreed. Now, she hasn't met those conditions\u2014taking a month and a half to get a job, not helping around the house, being messy. However, the author also had his own issues: the mom's behavior is causing him stress, and he's working hard to maintain the time-sharing agreement. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. Legally, if they had an agreement, the author might have grounds if she breached the terms. But since this is a personal arrangement (not a legal lease), it's more about mutual agreement. The author allowed her to stay with conditions, but maybe didn't set clear boundaries or terms. The mom didn't fulfill her part, so the author might feel justified. However, the author's reasons for allowing her to stay were partly self-serving (to see the son more), which could imply some ulterior motives. \n\nThe mom's behavior is problematic\u2014neglecting household duties, taking too long to get a job, partying. The author's response is to confront her, which she reacts poorly to, attacking him. The author is now considering kicking her out, which is understandable given the breach of agreement. But the author also feels conflicted because of the six-month promise and the potential legal repercussions regarding the child.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he made a verbal agreement, and she didn't meet her end. However, maybe the author didn't set clear terms. Also, the author's own behavior, like maybe not being entirely altruistic in allowing her to stay, could be a point. But the mom's actions are also clearly not meeting the expectations. \n\nI think the author has valid reasons to want her out given the breach of the verbal agreement. However, the fact that he allowed her to stay for six months and now wants to kick her out earlier might be an issue if there's no explicit contract. But if she's not fulfilling her part, then the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's disrespectful behavior and not contributing also support the author's decision. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The user might think the author is in the wrong because he's being harsh or maybe because of the ulterior motives, but the main issue here is the agreement. Since the author set conditions and the mom didn't meet them, the author isn't in the wrong. The key is that the author provided a place to stay under certain terms, and the mom didn't uphold her end. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
