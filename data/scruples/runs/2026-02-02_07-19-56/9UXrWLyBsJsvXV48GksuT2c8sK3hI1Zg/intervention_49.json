We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a father who had a breakup with the mother of his son. They have a time-sharing agreement, and he's been taking the kid on weekends and during the week when possible to help the mom find a job. She eventually moved in with him under the condition she helps around the house, finds a job, and he covers her expenses. However, she hasn't been fulfilling her part well\u2014taking time to get a job, partying, not keeping the place clean. He's upset and wants to kick her out but is worried about repercussions, like her blocking his access to his son. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the points. He offered her a place to stay with specific conditions. She agreed but didn't meet those conditions. He's bringing up his concerns, and she responds with insults and lies. He wants to end the arrangement because of her behavior. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless they had a formal written agreement, he might have the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's violating the terms they mutually agreed upon. However, since they're in a co-parenting situation, he needs to be cautious about how he proceeds to protect his custody rights. But from a moral standpoint, if she's not holding up her end of the deal and is disrespectful, is he in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's overstepping by using his custodial time to influence her job search or her personal choices. But he's also paying for her rent and childcare, so there's an expectation of her contribution. The key here is the mutual agreement. If he offered her a deal where she was supposed to do certain things, and she didn't, then he's not in the wrong for wanting her to leave. However, if he's using his position to control her behavior beyond the agreed terms, that might be different. But given the context, he seems to be within his rights to renegotiate or end the arrangement, especially if she's not meeting her obligations. Also, her behavior is disrespectful, which adds to his justification. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe they considered that he used the arrangement to get more time with the kid. But the user's own reasoning might be that the author had ulterior motives (50% self-interest). However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out now. Even if his motives were mixed, if she broke the agreement, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's within his rights to want to end the arrangement when the other party isn't meeting the agreed-upon terms.\n"
