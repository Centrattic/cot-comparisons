We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between the author (a father) and the mother of his son. They have a time-sharing agreement, and after the mother couldn't afford rent, he let her stay in his house under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, the author provided support by letting her stay, covering expenses, and helping her find a job. However, she didn't meet expectations: she took a month and a half to get a minimum wage job, partied, and didn't clean up. He confronted her, but she became hostile and insulted him. Now, he wants her out but feels guilty because he promised six months. He's worried about retaliation affecting his time with his son.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Key points: the mother's behavior (not cleaning, not job searching actively, partying) vs. the father's support and conditions. The father's initial offer had expectations of her contributing. She didn't meet those, leading to conflict. The father's desire to leave is due to her disrespect and unmet obligations. \n\nIs there a legal aspect? Since it's a custody situation, but the author is not the legal guardian. The mother's actions might affect custody, but the father's actions could be seen as trying to maintain a good environment for the child. However, if he kicks her out, she might use that to restrict his access. Legally, the father might have a right to ask her to leave if she's not adhering to the agreement, but it's complicated by custody laws.\n\nEmotionally, the father feels used and frustrated. He's working hard, sacrificing for the child, and she's not taking her responsibilities seriously. The mother's defensive and hostile behavior exacerbates the issue. The father is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the initial agreement's terms (six months) might have created an expectation that he's now breaking. But if she violated the terms by not contributing, he's not necessarily the bad guy.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the mother's actions fall short of what was agreed upon, and the father is reacting to her violations. The father is not in the wrong for wanting to enforce the terms he set. The answer is B.\n"
