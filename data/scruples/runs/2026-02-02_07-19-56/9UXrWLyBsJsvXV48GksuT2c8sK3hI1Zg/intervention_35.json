We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between a father and the mother of his son. The father is offering her a place to stay if she works and helps out, but she's not living up to his expectations. He's upset with her behavior, wants to kick her out, but is worried about the son and possible retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles each person is playing. The father is paying child support, covering expenses, and trying to spend time with the son. He allowed the mother to stay in his home under conditions that included her finding a job and contributing. The mother agreed but hasn't been working as hard as he wanted, staying out with friends, etc. When he confronts her, she attacks him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The father set conditions for her staying. If she's not meeting those conditions, then he has grounds to revoke the arrangement. However, he might have a responsibility to ensure her and the child's well-being. But since the child is with the mother, maybe the father's involvement is limited by custody arrangements. Also, he's providing housing, which is a significant help, but she's not fulfilling her part. \n\nThe father's frustration is understandable, but is he in the wrong for wanting to kick her out? If they had an agreement, and she's not meeting it, he's not necessarily wrong. However, the emotional aspect where he's using her staying as a way to see the son more might complicate things. He might have ulterior motives, but that doesn't automatically make him wrong if the agreement is broken. \n\nThe mother's behavior is problematic: not finding a job quickly, partying, not contributing. She also becomes confrontational. The father has a right to expect her to meet the conditions he set. If she's not doing that, ending the arrangement might be justified. However, he should consider the child's best interests. If she moves out, where will she and the son go? He might need to ensure the son's stability. Also, if she retaliates by limiting his access, that's a risk. \n\nThe father's initial offer had a six-month term, but maybe she didn't perform as agreed. He's not in the wrong for ending the arrangement early if she's not meeting the terms. However, the emotional manipulation and his own motives (seeing the son more) might make some see him as using the arrangement. But if she's violating the agreement, then he's justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He provided housing with conditions, she didn't meet them, and he's frustrated with her behavior. The mother is responsible for her actions, and he's within his rights to end the arrangement if she's not fulfilling her part.\n"
