We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the mother moved out, the father offered her a place to stay to spend more time with his son, and now there are issues with her behavior.\n\nFirst, the father allowed her to stay under the condition that she helps out, finds a job, etc. She agreed. But she didn't work hard to find a job quickly and instead partied and went on vacations. The father feels upset, especially since he's working hard and covering all the expenses. Then, when he confronts her about her behavior, she attacks him and lies, which he finds hurtful. Now he wants to kick her out but is concerned about retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the father is in the wrong for wanting to remove her from his home. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if he's allowing her to stay in his home as a lodger, the terms they agreed upon (like helping out and finding a job) might not be binding unless in a formal agreement. If he allowed her to stay with certain conditions and she's not meeting them, he might have the right to ask her to leave, especially if it's causing conflict. However, if there's no formal lease, he might need to follow local eviction laws, which can be tricky for roommates.\n\nEthically, the father's motivation is partly to see his son more, which is understandable. He's also handling all financial responsibilities. The mother's actions\u2014partying, not working hard\u2014might be seen as neglecting her responsibilities, especially as a parent. However, the father's reaction after she attacks him could be justified if she's been disrespectful. But he might need to consider if his initial offer was generous and if he's being fair in his expectations. The mother's response to criticism (attacking him) is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if it's not working. \n\nPotential issues: The father might not be in the wrong because he set conditions that she didn't meet. However, he should ensure that the eviction is handled properly to avoid legal issues. Also, considering the child's well-being is crucial here. If she moves out, the custody arrangement could affect the son's routine. But from the information given, the mother isn't fulfilling her part, which could justify the father's decision. So, the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
