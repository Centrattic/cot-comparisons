We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a man who's allowing his ex-girlfriend to stay in his house after their breakup because he wants to see his son more often. He's been paying child support and helping her find a job. Now he's considering kicking her out because of her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author offered her a place to stay with the condition that she helps around the house and finds a job. She took a month and a half to get a job, which he sees as slow. She's also been partying and not cleaning, which he finds upsetting. When he confronts her, she attacks him with insults. He feels she's disrespectful and wants her out, but he's worried about child custody issues.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they had a verbal agreement, that might not hold up in court. But the author is in a position where he's providing her housing, so if he kicks her out without a valid reason, maybe that could affect his child custody if the ex takes legal action. But he's also not in a romantic relationship anymore. \n\nEmotionally, he's frustrated because he's sacrificing a lot, working hard, and she's not meeting his expectations. He's jealous of her lifestyle. However, she's not under any legal obligation to work or behave a certain way unless there's a court order. Her actions might be poor, but does that make the author's desire to kick her out justified?\n\nHe also mentioned he did this partly to see his son more. Maybe he's overstepping by using her presence in his home as a way to control access to the child. If she moves out, the child goes with her, so he might lose time with his son, which he's already concerned about.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage by offering shelter in exchange for her not being around as much. But when she doesn't meet his expectations, he wants to remove her. However, kicking someone out without a lease agreement might be problematic, and if she retaliates by trying to block his access to the child, he might be in a worse position.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not legally obligated to let her stay, but by allowing her to stay, he might have created a dependency. If he knew she wasn't working and was being disrespectful, but still kept her there, maybe he's also partly to blame for not setting clearer boundaries from the start. However, he's allowed to change his mind if he feels the arrangement isn't working. \n\nThe main issue is whether his reasons for wanting to kick her out are justified. He's frustrated with her behavior and feels disrespected, but her actions might not be criminal. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances, but generally, if there's no legal agreement, he can ask her to leave, but he might need to follow proper procedures to avoid legal issues. However, since the question is about moral wrongdoing, it's more about his intentions and actions. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's within his rights to end the arrangement if it's not working. However, part of his motivation was self-serving (seeing his son more), which might not be the most selfless reason. But in terms of right or wrong, he's allowed to prioritize his needs. The ex's behavior is problematic, but the author's desire to kick her out is a response to that. So perhaps the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
