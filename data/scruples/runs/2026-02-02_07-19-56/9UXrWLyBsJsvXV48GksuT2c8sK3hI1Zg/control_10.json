We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for wanting to kick the mother out of his house. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are divorced, and the mother moved out with the son a couple of years ago. They had a time-sharing agreement, and the father took the kid more often during the week to help her find a job, which she wasn't working. He paid for childcare and child support consistently. Then the mother couldn't afford her rent, so the father let her stay in his house under the condition that she finds a job and helps around the house. He did this partly to help her and partly to spend more time with his son. \n\nNow, the mother's behavior since moving in is problematic. She's messy, took a month and a half to get a job (which is at a fast food place), and spends time partying, going on vacations, and seeing boyfriends. The father confronts her, but she attacks him back with lies and insults. He wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to the son.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? Well, he offered her a place to stay to help her get back on her feet and to see his son. He set conditions, and she didn't meet them. She's not fulfilling her part of the agreement, and her behavior is disrespectful. However, he did agree to let her stay for six months. So, maybe he's in a position where he can end the arrangement early if she's violating the terms. Also, considering the child's best interest, the father's motivation is to be more involved, which is understandable. The mother's actions seem neglectful, especially with the child involved. \n\nBut legally and ethically, when you allow someone to stay under certain conditions, if they break those conditions, you can ask them to leave. The father's concerns are valid, especially regarding the child's environment. The mother's behavior isn't setting a good example and might affect the child's well-being. So the father might not be in the wrong here. However, the part about retaliation and custody issues is a concern. He should consider legal advice to ensure his actions don't jeopardize his custody rights. But based on the information given, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to kick her out if she's violating the agreed terms and impacting the child negatively. So answer B.\n"
