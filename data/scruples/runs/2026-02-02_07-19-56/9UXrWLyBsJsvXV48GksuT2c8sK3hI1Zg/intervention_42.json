We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between the author and his son's mother, who moved in with him to save rent. The author's main reasons for letting her stay were partly to help her get back on her feet and partly to spend more time with his son. Now, he's considering kicking her out due to her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author had a time-sharing agreement before she moved in, and he's been covering childcare and expenses. When she moved in, he offered her a place under certain conditions. The problem arises from her actions: she's been messy, took a long time to find a job, partied, and now she's become defensive and insulting when he brings up his concerns. The author feels disrespected and wants her out, but he's worried about retaliation affecting his visitation rights.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Did the author make a reasonable agreement? It seems he set expectations for her to help around the house, find a job, and get back on her feet. She took a month and a half to get a job, which might be seen as slow, but job searches can be tough. However, the time frame and the activities she's engaging in (partying, vacations) could be viewed as irresponsible, especially as a parent. The author is working hard, and his frustration is understandable.\n\nBut then there's the emotional aspect. The author admitted he had ulterior motives for letting her stay, mainly to see his son more. This might complicate things because the arrangement wasn't purely altruistic. If he's using her to have more time with the child, that could be ethically questionable, but it's not necessarily wrong in a legal sense.\n\nThe other parent's behavior is also a factor. She's been defensive, lied, and insulted him. That's disrespectful and could justify the author wanting to end the arrangement. However, the author didn't set a clear timeline initially, only mentioning six months later. If he didn't communicate the six-month term upfront, he might be at fault for not being clear. If he did, then she knew the conditions, and he can enforce them.\n\nLegal considerations are important too. If they had an informal agreement, the author can't just kick her out without following proper procedures, especially since she's the child's mother. He needs to be cautious about his actions to avoid legal issues, like losing visitation rights if she retaliates. The author's frustration is valid, but he needs to handle this through proper channels to protect his rights.\n\nIn terms of moral blame, the author might bear some responsibility if he wasn't clear about the terms from the start. However, her behavior and the lack of progress on her part could also make her responsible. The author's dual motives (helping her and wanting more time with his son) don't make him entirely in the wrong, but they do show a potential conflict of interest that could have led to tension.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He made an agreement with certain expectations, and her not meeting them could justify ending the arrangement. However, he needs to handle it carefully to avoid legal repercussions and ensure his son's well-being. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, but with the caveat that he should proceed cautiously.\n"
