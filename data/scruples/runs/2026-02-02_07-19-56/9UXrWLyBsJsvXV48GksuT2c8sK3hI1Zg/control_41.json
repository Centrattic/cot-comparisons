We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and the ex-wife broke up, and the ex moved out with their son. The author had a time-sharing agreement and took on more childcare responsibilities to help the ex find a job. He's been paying child support consistently and covering the kid's expenses. That seems responsible on his part.\n\nThen, the ex couldn't afford rent because of unstable employment. The author offered her a place to stay on the condition that she helps with chores, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. He mentions he did this partly to help her but mainly to see his son more often. She agreed.\n\nThe issues start when she moves in. She makes a mess in their son's room, which he addresses and she eventually cleans. Then, she takes a month and a half to get a job at a fast food place, and during that time, she's partying, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriend's, etc. The author is upset by her behavior, thinking it's inappropriate for a mother and jealous of his own busy schedule.\n\nHe confronts her, but she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying about him. He feels hurt and sacrifices a lot for both her and the son. Now he wants to kick her out but is conflicted because he promised her six months, and he's worried she'll retaliate by affecting his time with the son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He helped her financially, allowed her to stay under certain conditions, and has been consistent with child support and time-sharing. He's trying to communicate his concerns but she responds with aggression and lies. Her behavior (partying, not working immediately) might be the issue here. He's frustrated and wants to leave because he feels disrespected and her actions are not meeting the agreed-upon terms.\n\nOn the ex's side: She's struggling with employment and perhaps has mental health or addiction issues (mentioned she was smoking weed). She might be under stress from the breakup and the pressure of finding a job. Her reactions are defensive and hostile, which could stem from her own stress and feelings of being judged. She might feel that the author is overstepping by controlling her living situation and job search.\n\nThe key points are the conditions set by the author. He offered a place to stay with the understanding that she would find a job and contribute. If she didn't meet those terms, he might have a valid reason to ask her to leave. However, he did give a six-month window, so if she hasn't met the conditions in that time, he's within his rights. But if she met some conditions (like getting a job eventually) but not others (like not helping around the house), that's a different story.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: he's allowing her to stay under a mutual agreement. If she violated the terms, he's justified in ending it. The fact that she's been disrespectful and confrontational adds to his justification. However, the fear of retaliation over custody is real, but that's more about potential legal issues rather than moral wrong.\n\nIn terms of morality, if the author set clear expectations and she didn't meet them, he's not wrong to leave. If he went back on a promise without cause, he might be wrong. But given her behavior and his consistent efforts, it's more about her not following through. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
