We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing the ex-wife to stay in his house to help her get back on her feet, but now he wants to kick her out because of her behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex moved in after the breakup, and the author offered her a place under certain conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, and getting back on her feet. The author mentions that part of his motivation was wanting to see his son more often. That might be a red flag because his intentions weren't entirely altruistic.\n\nThen there's the issue of her behavior. She took over the son's room, was messy, and took a month and a half to find a job. She also partied a lot, went on vacations, etc. The author is upset about this and feels she's not living up to the agreement. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. This pattern of her reacting negatively when he brings up issues is mentioned as recurring.\n\nThe author now wants to kick her out but is concerned about the six-month agreement and potential retaliation from her affecting his time with the son. He's conflicted between his anger and his fear of her response.\n\nNow, considering the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if she's a tenant, he might need to follow proper eviction procedures. But since it's a family situation, it's more complicated. Morally, the author agreed to let her stay for a specific time and under certain conditions. If she violated those conditions, he might have grounds to end the arrangement. However, his initial offer had mixed motives\u2014helping her and wanting more time with his son. That complicates the moral high ground because part of his offer was self-serving.\n\nHer actions: she wasn't fulfilling the job and house responsibilities, which were part of the agreement. She also engaged in behavior that the author found irresponsible, especially considering the child's well-being. But when confronted, she attacked him instead of addressing the issues. Her reaction might indicate poor communication or resentment, which could be a factor in the conflict.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's working hard, covering expenses, and feels disrespected. However, he also allowed her to stay under certain terms. If she didn't meet those terms, he could argue that he's justified in ending the arrangement. But he might need to consider the impact on his son and the potential legal repercussions of an eviction, especially if there are no clear legal agreements in place.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author is the one providing the living situation, so he has more control. If he decides to kick her out without a valid legal reason, it could be seen as unfair. However, if the agreement was verbal and she violated it, he might have a case. But the initial conditions weren't clearly defined, which is a problem.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to weigh both sides. The author's actions are driven by his own needs (more time with the child) and the ex's failure to meet the agreed-upon conditions. However, his mixed motives and the lack of a formal agreement might mean he's not entirely in the right. On the other hand, her failure to comply with the basic terms of the agreement could justify his actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if the ex violated the terms. However, his initial offer having self-serving motives complicates things. The key is whether the conditions were clear and if she breached them. If so, he could be justified in wanting to end the arrangement. But if the agreement was too vague, he might be overstepping. I think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe A if the conditions weren't properly set. Hmm.\n"
