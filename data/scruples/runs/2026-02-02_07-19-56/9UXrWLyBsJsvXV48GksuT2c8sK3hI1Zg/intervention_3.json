We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for wanting to kick his ex out. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man and his ex broke up a couple of years ago. The ex moved out with their son, and they have a time-sharing agreement where he gets the kid on weekends. He's been helping out by covering more days during the week so she can find a job, paying for childcare, and never missing child support. That seems responsible on his part.\n\nThen, the ex couldn't afford her rent because she hadn't had a steady job. The man offered her to stay with him under the condition that she helps with chores, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. She agreed. But he mentions he did this partly to see his son more. So maybe his intentions were a mix of altruism and self-interest.\n\nAfter she moved in, things didn't go smoothly. She left a mess in the son's room, took weeks to get a job, and partied a lot. He's upset because he's working hard while she's doing the opposite. Then, when he confronts her, she insults him and accuses him of being a deadbeat, which he's not. He feels hurt and wants to kick her out but is worried about her retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he offered her a place to stay with conditions. She agreed but didn't meet those conditions well. However, he also admitted that part of his motivation was to see his son more. When she moved in, maybe he didn't consider if that arrangement was sustainable. Also, he's working hard and paying child support, so he's fulfilling his responsibilities.\n\nBut when she moved in, they made an informal agreement. If he gave her a six-month stay, and she's not meeting the terms, maybe he's justified in wanting to end it. However, the way he frames it seems like he's using her not working as a reason, but maybe he should have addressed the issues earlier. Also, his motivation for wanting her out might be partly jealousy over her social life, which complicates things.\n\nHis ex's behavior is problematic\u2014lying and attacking him\u2014but he also might have set up unclear expectations. If he didn't formalize the agreement, maybe he's not in the wrong for ending it now, especially if she's violating the terms. However, the fact that he's afraid she might retaliate suggests there's a history of conflict, which might be her fault more than his.\n\nSo, considering all this, he's probably not entirely in the wrong. He's trying to enforce the terms he set, even if his reasons are mixed. But he could have handled it better by addressing issues sooner. Still, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. Given that she broke the agreement, he might not be. So the answer is B.\n"
