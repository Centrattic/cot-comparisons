We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and the mom broke up, and she moved out with their son. The author had the kid on weekends and helped with childcare so she could find a job. Then the mom couldn't afford rent, so the author offered her a place to stay under certain conditions, like helping with chores, finding a job, etc. The mom agreed. But she didn't clean up her stuff in the son's room, took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and when the author confronted her, she turned the blame and insulted him. Now the author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he offered her six months. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author allowed the mom to stay under specific terms. He set conditions for her staying, which she agreed to. She didn't meet those conditions\u2014taking too long to get a job, not cleaning up, partying. He's upset because he's trying to see his son more and feels she's not contributing. But he also mentions part of the reason he offered her the stay was to see his son more. So maybe there's some self-interest here.\n\nWhen he confronted her, she reacted angrily and lied about him. That's a problem. The author might feel justified in wanting her out because she's not meeting the agreed-upon terms. However, he's also worried she might retaliate and affect his visitation rights. But from a legal standpoint, if they have a custody agreement, her behavior might not legally prevent him from seeing the kid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a commitment to let her stay for six months. Even if she's not meeting the conditions, breaking that agreement early could be seen as a problem. But if she's violating the terms he set, maybe he's within his rights to end the arrangement. The key points are the conditions he set and whether she violated them.\n\nThe author might be in the right if he can show that she didn't fulfill the agreed-upon terms. However, he also had his own issues, like maybe not being as available as he could be if he's working a lot. There's some back and forth here. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's motivations for helping her were mixed. \n\nIn legal terms, if it was a formal agreement, he might need a reason to terminate. But since it's a personal arrangement, he can probably decide to end it if she's not following the rules. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where he should have handled it differently, like giving her a chance to improve before kicking her out. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since she violated the terms, he might be justified in ending the arrangement.\n"
