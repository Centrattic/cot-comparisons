We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for wanting to kick their son's mom out. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and ex-girlfriend broke up, and the son is with the mom. They have a time-sharing agreement. The author has been helping the mom by covering childcare so she could work, and he's been paying child support. When the mom couldn't afford her rent, the author offered her a place to stay if she helped around the house, found a job, etc. The mom accepted. But then she left a mess, took a month and a half to find a job, partied a lot, and when the author confronted her, she attacked him with insults and lies. Now the author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he said she could stay for six months.\n\nSo, the main questions here are: Did the author do something wrong by offering her a place to stay with conditions? Is he in the wrong for wanting to remove her now that she's not meeting those conditions? Also, considering the mom's behavior and the author's concerns about his son's well-being.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be based on wanting to see his son more often, but he also helped the mom by offering her a place. The mom didn't meet the agreed-upon terms (job, helping around the house), and her reaction was hostile. The author is not in a position to enforce legal custody changes, but he's talking about kicking her out of his home, which is a different matter. If she's a tenant, he might have the right to ask her to leave if the terms of their agreement aren't met. However, since she has the child with her, there might be legal complexities. But the question isn't about the law, just whether he's in the wrong morally.\n\nThe mom's behavior is problematic\u2014dragging her feet on finding a job, partying, and being disrespectful. The author's desire to remove her stems from her not fulfilling the agreement and her disrespectful behavior. He also mentions jealousy, which adds a personal element. But his primary concern seems to be the well-being of the child and his own sacrifices. \n\nIs he at fault for wanting to end the arrangement when she's not meeting her part? It seems like he's not in the wrong because he made terms clear, and she didn't adhere to them. However, he might have been naive in expecting her to follow through. The emotional aspect is tricky, but the key point is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to remove her. Since she violated the terms and was disrespectful, he's likely justified in his decision. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
