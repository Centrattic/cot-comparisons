We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. They're sharing a story about a breakup and the current living arrangement with the ex. The main points are that the author (let's call them Dad) allowed the ex (Mom) to live with him to spend more time with their son. The Mom hasn't been working consistently, took a while to get a job, and has been partying. Now Dad wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The Dad provided a place to stay in exchange for the Mom finding a job and helping around the house. She accepted, but her actions didn't meet expectations. He's upset about her behavior and feels disrespected. He's also concerned about her possible retaliation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they have a written agreement stating a six-month stay, then she might have a claim. But if it's just a verbal agreement, he might have more flexibility. However, the Mom's actions\u2014like not contributing as agreed\u2014could be grounds for ending the arrangement. But the Dad's motivation was partly to spend more time with the kid, which might not be a valid reason if he's breaking the agreement.\n\nEmotionally, the Dad is frustrated. He's working hard, covering expenses, and feels the Mom isn't pulling her weight. But he's also being judgmental about her lifestyle and partying, which might not be the Mom's problem. The Mom's reaction could be defensiveness, possibly due to feeling criticized. The Dad's jealousy might be influencing his perspective.\n\nEthically, is it fair for the Dad to kick her out after agreeing to six months? If she violated the terms, then maybe not in the wrong. But if he's breaking the agreement without valid cause, he could be the one at fault. Also, the fear of retaliation is real in co-parenting situations. Courts usually prioritize the child's best interest, so the Dad's actions could affect custody if he's seen as retaliatory.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether there was a valid agreement and if she breached it. If there was a six-month verbal agreement, and he's ending it early without cause, maybe he's in the wrong. But if she didn't meet the terms (no job, not helping), then he might have grounds. However, his initial intent was to see the kid more, which complicates things. The Mom's behavior is questionable, but his response could be seen as selfish. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he benefits from her staying and is breaking the agreement out of self-interest, not just her failings. Alternatively, if she breached the agreement, then B (not in the wrong). But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key is the agreement terms and mutual responsibilities. If he agreed to six months, breaking that without valid reason could make him the AITA.\n"
