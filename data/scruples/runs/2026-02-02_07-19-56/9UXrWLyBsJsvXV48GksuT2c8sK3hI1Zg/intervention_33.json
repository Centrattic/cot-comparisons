We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a bit complicated. The author and the ex-wife broke up, and the ex moved out with their son. They have a time-sharing agreement, and the author has been taking care of the child's expenses and paying child support. Then, the ex couldn't afford her rent, so the author offered her a place to stay with the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and covers living expenses and childcare. She accepted, but the author's main motivation was to see their son more often.\n\nNow, after she moves in, there are several issues. She left a mess, took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, went on vacations, and stayed at her boyfriend's house. The author confronts her, and she gets defensive, insulting him and calling him a deadbeat. The author is upset because he feels he's been sacrificing a lot and now wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since they have a time-sharing agreement, the author's access to the child is part of that. If he kicks her out, she might take legal action, but since the child's custody is part of the agreement, it's unclear. Legally, the author might have some standing if the ex is not following the agreement, but if the author is the one breaking the housing arrangement, that could complicate things.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The author admitted part of the reason for letting her stay was to see the son more. That might not be inherently wrong, but it could show some self-interest. The ex took advantage of the situation by not working hard to find a job and partied a lot. However, the author also enabled her by covering all expenses. Maybe the author didn't set clear boundaries from the start. When she started the job search, it took time, but a month and a half isn't extremely long, though maybe slow. The author's frustration is understandable, but confronting her led to her attacking him, which is her issue.\n\nThe author's main argument is that she's being disrespectful and not fulfilling her part of the deal. But he also didn't state that he had a written agreement. If it was verbal, enforcing it could be hard. Also, he's using the house as leverage to control her behavior, which might not be fair. The ex's actions are problematic, but the author's solution (kicking her out) might be a bit harsh without proper agreement in place.\n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because he didn't set clear terms and conditions upfront, maybe with legal backing. By allowing her to stay under a verbal agreement, he's now in a position where he can't enforce it effectively. Also, his initial offer was partly self-serving, which might have led to this conflict. He needs to consider legal advice before taking action to avoid risking his time-sharing rights. On the other hand, she's not fulfilling her part either. So, maybe the answer is that the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's some fault on both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one wanting to terminate the agreement without a clear basis, he might be in the wrong legally, but ethically, he has valid reasons. But since the options are A or B, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to decide. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong, because the ex isn't meeting her end of the deal, but the author's approach might be flawed. However, without a legal agreement, it's hard to say. I think the answer is B.\n"
