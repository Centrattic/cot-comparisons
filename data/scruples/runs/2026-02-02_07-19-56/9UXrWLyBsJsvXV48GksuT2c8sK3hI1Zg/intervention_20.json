We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick the ex out of their house. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the ex moved in to get closer to the kid and help her get back on her feet. The author offered a place to stay under certain conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, and contributing. The ex agreed, but then took a month and a half to find a job, partied a lot, and didn't clean up her stuff. The author is upset because they feel she's not living up to her end of the deal, and also feels jealous because the ex is doing things they can't, like going out with friends. Then, when the author confronts her, she attacks back with lies, calling him a deadbeat. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting custody.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement. He offered her a place to stay with the conditions. She agreed. She didn't meet the job condition quickly, which might be a valid reason. But the author also admitted part of his motivation was to spend more time with the kid. So maybe there's some ulterior motive here. Also, the ex's behavior\u2014partying, not cleaning up\u2014could be seen as not upholding her part. However, the author is now considering kicking her out before the six-month period mentioned. If he promised six months, going back on that might not be fair. Also, the ex not having a steady job history is part of why she moved in, so expecting her to find a job quickly might be unrealistic.\n\nBut then there's the issue of the author's jealousy. He mentions he works a lot and doesn't have time for the same activities. That might be a personal issue, but it's affecting his judgment. The ex's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might be influenced by his own stress and feelings of being taken advantage of.\n\nLegally, if they had a verbal agreement for six months, he might need to honor that unless there's a breach. The ex's failure to find a job quickly could be a breach, but it's not clear if there was a specific timeline agreed upon. If the author set a specific deadline for her to find a job, that's one thing, but if it's just a general expectation, it's harder to enforce. Also, the author is covering rent and expenses, which adds pressure on him if she's not contributing.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels disrespected and hurt by the ex's attacks when he confronts her. That's understandable, but maybe he should have handled the confrontation differently. The ex's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's desire to kick her out now might be valid if she's not respecting the agreement. However, the author's own motivations (wanting to see the kid more) could cloud his judgment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. If the ex breached the agreement by not meeting the conditions, then the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her out. But if the conditions were too vague, then maybe the author's expectations were unrealistic. Also, the author's jealousy and personal issues might not be fair reasons to kick her out, but the ex's behavior is legitimate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong if the ex didn't meet the agreed-upon conditions, even if some of his reasons are personal. However, if the agreement was for six months without specific terms, he might be in the wrong for breaking it. The ex's actions (not finding a job quickly, partying) are issues, but maybe the author should have been more flexible given her history. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the ex isn't fulfilling her part of the deal, but A if the conditions were too vague or the author's motives are selfish. But since the author did offer help with conditions and she didn't meet them, B seems more accurate.\n"
