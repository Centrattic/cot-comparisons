We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a man who let his ex live with him so he could see his son more. The ex agreed to help around the house, find a job, and get back on her feet. She took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and left the kid's room messy. When he confronted her, she attacked him with insults. Now he wants to kick her out but feels bad because he said she could stay six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since they have a time-sharing agreement, allowing the ex to live there might affect custody. If he kicks her out, could she use that against him in court? But maybe he's allowed to change his mind if there's a valid reason, like her not meeting the terms they agreed on. However, the initial agreement wasn't formalized, so it's hard to enforce.\n\nEmotionally, the man feels he's been sacrificing a lot, paying child support, covering expenses, and working hard. The ex's behavior is disrespectful, and she's not meeting her end of the deal. He's also jealous because she's doing things he can't. But jealousy might be a personal issue, even if it's a factor.\n\nThe ex's actions: she didn't clean up quickly, took a long time to get a job, partied, and was disrespectful when confronted. She might be in the wrong for not following through on her promises. But he allowed her to stay under certain conditions, and she didn't meet them. However, did he have the right to set those conditions? Maybe, as it's his home. But if the arrangement was informal, he might be within his rights to revoke it if she's not adhering.\n\nThe key points are whether the man is in the wrong for wanting to kick her out. The ex is not following the agreed terms, and he's unhappy with her behavior. He's also concerned about retaliation affecting custody. Legally, he might be in the right if he can show that the living arrangement was conditional on her meeting certain responsibilities. However, if there's no formal agreement, it's tricky. Emotionally, he's justified in being upset, but the act of kicking someone out can have legal repercussions, especially regarding the child.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author (the man) isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave the arrangement if the ex isn't fulfilling her part. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
