We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a father who had a breakup with his son's mother a year or two ago. They had a time-sharing agreement, and he was taking the kid on weekends and more during the week because the mother wasn't working. He paid for childcare so she could find a job. Now, she can't afford rent and he offered her to stay in his house if she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. She agreed. \n\nThe problem started when she moved in. She messed up the son's room, left a mess. He nagged her until she cleaned it. She took a month and a half to get a job, partying and going on vacations. He's upset because he's working hard and she's not living up to his expectations. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. Now he wants to kick her out but feels bad because he said six months. Also, he's worried she might try to block him from seeing his son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's initial help: he offered her a place to stay to get her back on her feet, which he mentions is partly to see his son more. That's a bit self-interested, but maybe not wrong. The problem is that she didn't meet his expectations. But when he confronted her, she lashed out. Now he wants to kick her out. However, he made a commitment of six months. Did he actually set clear terms? The post says she accepted the offer, but he didn't specify a timeline beyond six months. Maybe the six months were a trial period? If he didn't have a formal agreement, he might be in a position where he can't just kick her out without consequences.\n\nAlso, the mother's actions: she's not working full-time, partying, not cleaning up. But he allowed her to stay under conditions. If she's not meeting those conditions, maybe he has grounds to end the arrangement. But was the six-month period a binding agreement? If he didn't formalize it, he might still have leeway, but it's not clear.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. When he brings up issues, she attacks him. That's a problem, but does he have a right to confront her? He's trying to address her behavior, which affects their living situation. However, perhaps his approach wasn't constructive, leading to conflict.\n\nBut the main question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he offered her a place with conditions and she violated them, maybe he's justified. However, he also had his own self-interest in wanting to see his son more. The mother's behavior is questionable, but the father's decision to evict her might be within his rights if the living arrangement was temporary and conditional. However, if there's no formal agreement, it's a bit murky. Also, the fear of her blocking access to the child is a legal concern. Child custody can be affected by such actions, so he might need to be cautious.\n\nIn terms of morality, is he in the wrong? If he's following through on conditions he set, then maybe not. However, if he's using her to have more time with the kid under the guise of helping her, that could be seen as manipulative. Also, the way he's handling the eviction could be problematic if it's not done properly, especially regarding the child's welfare.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. If he offered a trial period and she didn't meet the terms, he's not wrong to end it. But if he's being selfish in his motives, maybe there's some fault there. The answer might be A or B. Need to decide.\n"
