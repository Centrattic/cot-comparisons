We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for wanting to kick their son's mom out of their house.\n\nSo, the setup is that the author and the ex-wife broke up a couple of years ago. The ex moved out with their son, and they have a time-sharing agreement where the author gets the kid on weekends. The author took on more responsibility during the week when the ex wasn't working, covering childcare costs so she could find a job. The author has been paying child support consistently and covering all the kid's expenses.\n\nThen, the ex couldn't afford her rent because she didn't have a steady job. The author offered her a place to stay under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, etc. She agreed. The author mentions that part of the reason for this offer was to see the kid more often. \n\nThe problem arises after she moves in. She's messy, took weeks to get a job, and spends time partying, going on vacations, etc. The author gets upset because he thinks her behavior isn't appropriate for a mother and feels jealous since he can't do those things. When he brings these issues up, she attacks him, accuses him of being a deadbeat, and lies. The author wants to kick her out but feels obligated because he initially promised her six months. He's also worried about retaliation affecting his time with the kid.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the agreement they made when the ex moved in. The author offered her a place to stay with certain conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, etc. She agreed. Now, she didn't meet those conditions\u2014taking time to get a job, not contributing around the house, and her behavior. The author can argue that she violated the terms of their agreement. \n\nHowever, the author also had his own motives (seeing the kid more) which might not be entirely selfless. But that doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong. The main issue is whether he's justified in wanting to end the arrangement because she's not fulfilling her end. \n\nIf the agreement wasn't formal (like a legal contract), then the author might have the right to revoke the offer since she's not meeting the expectations. But the author also has to consider that he allowed her to stay knowing her history of not having a steady job. Maybe he should have anticipated the challenges. However, the ex is violating the terms they agreed upon. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's working hard, covering expenses, and she's not contributing as agreed. Her behavior after moving in includes not cleaning up, not getting a job quickly, and then attacking him when he brings up these issues. The author's desire to end the arrangement is based on her not fulfilling her responsibilities. \n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect: the author's jealousy and frustration with her lifestyle. He mentions being jealous because he can't do those things. That might be a personal issue, but the main problem is her not meeting the agreed terms. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, unless there's a formal agreement, the author can't be held legally responsible for her living there. But if they had a verbal agreement, the author might still be within his rights to ask her to leave if she's not adhering to the terms. The ex's retaliation (keeping the kid from the author) would be a separate issue, but the author's right to ask her out is valid if she's violating the agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. He provided her a place to stay with conditions, she didn't meet them, and he wants to end the arrangement. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
