We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the ex is staying with the author, and there are some tensions.\n\nFirst, the author let the ex stay at his house with the condition that she finds a job and helps out. He says he did this partly to help her but mainly to see his son more. The ex was given some time to get a job, which she finally did after a month and a half. However, during that time, she was partying and going on vacations, which the author disapproves of. He confronts her, and she attacks him back, calling him a deadbeat. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about the child custody implications.\n\nSo, the main points here are about whether the author is justified in wanting to kick her out. Let's break it down. The author allowed her to stay under certain terms. If she didn't meet those terms (like helping around the house, finding a job), maybe he's within his rights to end the arrangement. But he also mentions he's been paying child support and trying to spend time with his son. However, by letting her stay, he created a living situation where they're under the same roof, which might complicate things.\n\nThe ex's behavior: she didn't clean up immediately, took time to get a job, partied a lot. The author is upset because he's working hard and feels she's not contributing. But when he confronts her, she lashes out, which he finds disrespectful. Now he wants to remove her. But he's worried about custody.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author is the one providing the home and the terms were agreed upon, he can choose to ask her to leave if she's not meeting the conditions. However, since they have a child together, the custody arrangement is important. If the mother's presence is affecting the child's well-being, the court might consider that. But the author's own behavior (like maybe not being present before) could be a factor.\n\nMoral standpoint: The author may feel he's being unfair, but he's also in a position of power because he's hosting her. He might be using the situation to spend more time with his son, which is understandable. However, the way he's handling the conflict (calling her out, then wanting to kick her out) could be seen as self-serving. The mother's actions (partying, not working) might be neglectful, but the author also allowed her to stay with certain expectations.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's actions are justified. If he provided the conditions and she didn't meet them, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, his initial motivation (to see the child more) and the way the confrontation went down might affect his credibility. Also, if kicking her out would impact the child's visitation rights, that's a consideration. But the author might have the right to end the arrangement if she's not fulfilling her part. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
