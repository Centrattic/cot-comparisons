We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're an ex-partner who allowed the mother of their child to move in with them. The main points are that he offered her a place to stay with the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. She agreed, but then he's upset because she didn't clean up, took a long time to get a job, and spent time partying. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his time with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says he offered her a place to stay to help her but also to see his son more. He covered rent and expenses. She moved in, but he's unhappy with her behavior. He's bringing up his concerns, and she responds by attacking him, calling him a deadbeat and using lies. He's trying to address issues but feels disrespected. Now he wants her out because of her actions and the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might have her own perspective. She was in a situation where she couldn't afford rent, and the ex-offered help. If she agreed to the conditions, maybe she didn't meet them, but maybe there were reasons. The fact that she found a job after a month and a half might not be as bad as he thinks, but he's frustrated. Also, he's working full-time and managing childcare, so his stress is valid.\n\nBut when he brings up the issues, she attacks him. That's a problem. If she's not respecting his boundaries or taking the conditions seriously, then maybe he's justified in wanting her to leave, especially if there was an agreement. However, he did say she could stay for six months, and he's considering kicking her out before that. If the agreement was for six months, ending it early without a valid reason might not be fair. But if she violated the terms (like not helping with housework, not finding a job quickly enough, etc.), then maybe he's within his rights.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: he's upset because he's sacrificing a lot, and she's partying. But he was the one who allowed her to stay under certain conditions. If she didn't meet them, he has a right to revoke the offer. However, the way he feels about her behavior (jealousy and feeling she's not being a good mother) might be personal issues that shouldn't dictate the living arrangement. But if she's neglecting her responsibilities, that's different.\n\nThe key here is whether he allowed her to stay under specific terms, and she failed to meet them. If that's the case, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. Also, her behavior in attacking him and spreading lies is poor conduct. He's trying to address his concerns, but she's being defensive and aggressive. So his desire to remove her isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the initial agreement was conditional on her actions. But if the six-month period wasn't a strict contract, maybe he's overstepping. However, given the circumstances, he might be justified in ending the arrangement early if she's not meeting the agreed-upon terms.\n"
