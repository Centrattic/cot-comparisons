We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between an ex and his ex-partner, their son, and the current living arrangement. The author, a dad, let his ex move in to help her get back on her feet, partly to see his son more. Now he's considering kicking her out because she's not pulling her weight, partying, and being disrespectful when confronted.\n\nFirst, the setup: After the breakup, the dad has a time-sharing agreement. The mom wasn't working, so he took more days and paid for childcare. Now she's in a financial crisis and he offers her a place to stay with conditions. She agrees. But she's not meeting those conditions\u2014slow job search, messy behavior, partying. He's upset, brings it up, she attacks him. He wants to kick her out but is worried about losing custody.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one side, he's helping her out, providing a home, covering expenses. But he had conditions. If she's not meeting them, maybe it's reasonable to end the arrangement. However, he also has a motive to see his son more, which might complicate things. Is that exploitation? Maybe not necessarily wrong, but a bit self-serving. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom isn't fulfilling her end. She's not working much, partying, being disrespectful. That's on her. But when he brings it up, she becomes hostile and lies. So he's justified in feeling wronged. But does that make him right to kick her out? If they had a verbal agreement for six months, he's breaking that by ending it early. However, if she's not meeting the terms, he could argue that the agreement was conditional. Maybe he's not in the wrong for ending it if the conditions weren't met. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of co-parenting. If she moves out, he needs to ensure his son's well-being. If she retaliates by cutting him off, that could be a problem. But if he's acting in good faith to set boundaries, maybe he's justified. However, his initial offer included helping her, which he did partly out of self-interest. That's not necessarily wrong, but it's a bit of a conflict of interest. \n\nIs there any point where he overstepped? Like, forcing her to stay because he wanted to see the kid more, even if she wasn't pulling her weight? But he offered the arrangement with conditions. If she agreed and then failed, he's within his rights to end it. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut what about the emotional aspect? The mom's behavior is problematic, but the dad's frustration is understandable. He's trying to balance his responsibilities and his own needs. If he's treating her with respect, even when she's disrespectful, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being unfair, maybe he is. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if it's a verbal agreement, he can end it as long as he gives notice. Since he told her six months, maybe he needs to wait or provide a reason. But if the terms were that she has to work, and she didn't, then he can end it early. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to enforce the conditions of the agreement she agreed to. Her not meeting them gives him the right to end the arrangement. However, the emotional dynamics are complex, but legally and according to the agreement, he might be justified. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
