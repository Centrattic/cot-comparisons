We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and the son's mom broke up a couple of years ago. They have a time-sharing agreement where the author has the son on weekends and covers childcare so the mom can find a job. The author pays all expenses and child support. Then, the mom can't afford rent, so the author offers her a place to stay in exchange for helping out, finding a job, and getting back on her feet. The author admits part of the reason was to see the son more often. \n\nThe mom moves in, but the author is upset because she's messy, takes too long to get a job, parties a lot, and the author feels she's not being a good mother. When the author confronts her, the mom attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and using lies. Now the author wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months and fears retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author offered a living arrangement with conditions (helping out, finding a job). The mom accepted. If she's not meeting those conditions, maybe the author is within his rights to ask her to leave. However, the author had a specific time frame (six months) which he's now considering breaking. But maybe the conditions were part of the agreement, so if she's not fulfilling them, he can end it early. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motives were partly selfish (to see his son more), which might make his position less clear. Also, the mom's behavior (partying, not working) could be a problem, but if the author had a formal agreement, maybe he should have followed it. However, the situation is more informal, so maybe the author isn't wrong to reassess based on her not meeting expectations. \n\nThe mom's reaction (attacking him) is problematic, but that doesn't excuse the author from potential responsibility. The key points are whether the author's conditions were clear and if the mom violated them. If the author didn't have a formal agreement, he might still have the right to ask her to leave if she's not meeting expectations. Also, the author's jealousy about not having time for fun is a personal issue but doesn't justify the actions. \n\nConsidering all this, the author provided a living arrangement with certain terms. If the mother isn't fulfilling them, it's reasonable for him to end the arrangement, even if it's before six months. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, maybe the author should have considered other options before asking her to leave, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say he's entirely wrong.\n"
