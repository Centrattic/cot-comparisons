We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their ex-partner out after she moved in. \n\nFirst, the author and his ex broke up, and he has custody of their son on weekends and covers childcare so she can find a job. She moves in with him under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. The author mentions that he's been paying child support, working full-time, and covering all the kid's expenses. \n\nNow, after she moves in, she's messy, takes a month and a half to get a job, parties a lot, and when confronted, she attacks him with insults. He wants to kick her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay for six months. Also, he's worried she might try to block his access to his son.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if they have a time-sharing agreement, the author's access to his son should be protected regardless of their living arrangement. The mother's behavior\u2014partying, not working\u2014might affect her custody, but the father's decision to let her stay in his home is a separate issue. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave if the arrangement isn't working. He set conditions (housework, job), which she didn't meet. His reasons for offering the stay (to be near his son but also to help her) are personal, but he's not obligated to keep her there if she's not fulfilling her part. The mother's attacks are her responsibility, and the author's feelings of jealousy and frustration are valid given his sacrifices. \n\nHe's also concerned about retaliation affecting his time with the son. But the author isn't the one violating the custody agreement; the mother's actions might pose a risk, but that's a different issue. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the living arrangement. Since he's not legally bound to let her stay and she's not meeting her end, he's justified in wanting to kick her out. So the answer should be B.\n"
