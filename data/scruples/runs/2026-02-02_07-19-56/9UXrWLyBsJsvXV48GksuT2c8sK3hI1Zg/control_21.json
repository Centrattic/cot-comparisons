We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent wanting to kick the other parent out of their house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and the ex (the mother) have a time-sharing agreement. The author has been covering child support and childcare, allowing the mother to work. She moved in last year because she couldn't afford rent, and the author offered her a place under certain conditions. But she hasn't been helpful around the house, took a long time to get a job, and partied a lot. The author is upset and feels disrespected, leading to a conflict where the mother lashed out, calling him a deadbeat. Now the author wants her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. He provided a place for her to stay, expecting her to contribute and find a job. She initially didn't meet those expectations. He tried to address the issues, but she responded with anger and lies. He's now considering kicking her out because of her behavior.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author is the landlord, he can set conditions for tenancy. If she violated the agreed terms (not helping around the house, not getting a job), he might have a case. However, family situations can be complex. Emotionally, the author is frustrated, and the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. But the author did agree to a six-month stay, so ending it early might be an issue unless there's a breach of the agreement. The key points are: the author's conditions weren't met, the mother's disrespectful behavior, and the potential legal risks if she fights back.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to protect his own space and well-being. The mother's actions (partying, not contributing) might be seen as not fulfilling her part of the deal. However, the author's initial motivation might have been to spend more time with his son, which adds a layer of complexity. Still, he's providing a home, and she's not meeting the expectations. \n\nThe mother's response\u2014attacking him and lying\u2014further justifies his wanting to end the arrangement. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to remove someone who's disrespectful and not upholding their end of the agreement. The answer is B.\n"
