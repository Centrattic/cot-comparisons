We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a father who had a breakup with the mother of his son. They have a time-sharing agreement where he has the kid on weekends and sometimes during the week. He's been paying child support consistently, covering all expenses, and working full-time. The mother wasn't working, so he took on more childcare to help her find a job. Then she moved in with him because she couldn't pay her rent, agreeing to help around the house and find a job. He mentions it's 50% for helping her and 50% to see his son more often.\n\nNow, after she moves in, the first few weeks are messy. She leaves a mess in the son's room, which he confronts her about, and she cleans up after being bothered. She took a month and a half to get a job at a fast food place, and during that time, she was partying, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriend's house, and going on vacations. The author is upset because he thinks this isn't appropriate behavior for a mother and also feels jealous because he can't do those things due to his schedule. When he brings these issues up, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying, which hurts him. He wants to kick her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay for six months. He's worried she might retaliate by trying to keep him from his son.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let's consider the key points. \n\nFirst, the initial agreement: he offered her a place to stay with conditions (helping around the house, finding a job) and covered living expenses and childcare. She accepted. Now, she didn't meet those conditions quickly, taking a month and a half to get a job, and during that time, she wasn't contributing much. The author might feel that her behavior is unacceptable and that she's not fulfilling her part of the deal. \n\nOn the other hand, he admitted he had his own motives for letting her stay, partly to see his son more. That could be a red flag. Also, when she's not meeting his expectations, he confronts her, but she responds with hostility, which he finds hurtful. He wants to kick her out now, but he's concerned about the legal implications and her retaliation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they had a verbal agreement for six months, he might be bound by that unless there's a way to terminate it early. But since he's the one who set the terms, he might have the right to end it if she's not fulfilling her part. However, the emotional and legal complexities around child custody could complicate things. If she moves out, would that affect his access to his son? That's a valid concern. \n\nEthically, the author is frustrated that she's not meeting the agreed-upon responsibilities and is behaving in ways he deems irresponsible. But he also has a history of her attacking him when he tries to address issues. His jealousy over not being able to do the same things as her might be a personal issue, but it's a human emotion. The mother's behavior could be seen as neglecting her responsibilities as a parent, but the author is also in a position where he's allowing her to stay in his home with his son, so he might have some responsibility in setting clear boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. He's trying to enforce what he considered an agreement, but maybe he didn't set clear terms at the beginning. He also might be projecting his own stress (work, childcare) onto her. However, if she's not meeting the terms he agreed to, he has a right to reassess the situation. The key is whether he was clear about expectations from the start. If he was, then she's not meeting them, and he's justified. But if he didn't set clear boundaries, maybe he's contributing to the situation.\n\nIn terms of emotional responsibility, he's handling his frustration by wanting to kick her out, which could be a valid choice, but he's also aware of potential retaliation. There's a balance between self-respect and the well-being of the child. Since the child is involved, the author's actions could affect the child's stability. If she's being irresponsible, maybe it's in the child's best interest for the author to set boundaries. However, if the author's main motivation was partly selfish (to see his son more), maybe that's a factor.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is pointing out her failures and his own contributions. The mother's behavior is questionable, but the author's initial motives might cast some doubt on his intentions. However, the core issue is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to terminate the arrangement. Since he's the one who created the agreement, if she's not meeting his terms, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author might have some flaws in handling the situation, but the main question is about being in the wrong. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic, so the author's desire to kick her out is more justified.\n"
