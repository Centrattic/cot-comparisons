We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to kick out his ex, the mother of their child, after she moved in with him under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and his ex broke up, and she moved out with their son. They have a time-sharing agreement, and he's been covering childcare so she could find a job. Recently, she couldn't afford her rent, so he offered her a place to stay if she helped around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. He mentions he did this partly to help her and partly to see his son more.\n\nNow, the ex's behavior after moving in is an issue. She left a mess in the son's room, took a month and a half to find a job at a fast food place, spent time partying, going on vacations, etc. The author feels upset and jealous because he works hard and doesn't have time for such activities. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and spreading lies. He wants to kick her out but feels he promised her six months and is worried she might retaliate by keeping him from his son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's been consistent with child support, provided childcare, and offered a place to stay with conditions. He's upset about her not meeting those conditions and her disrespectful behavior. From the ex's side, she might feel that the author is overstepping by setting conditions on her living arrangements, especially after a breakup. Also, if she's struggling with employment and using her free time as she sees fit, maybe she's not in a good place mentally or financially.\n\nLegally, the situation could be tricky. The author isn't her legal guardian, so he might not have the authority to set such conditions for her living in his home. The ex could argue that his offer to house her is not a legal agreement and that he can't enforce terms like job searching. However, since the author is also the father of the child, there might be shared custody arrangements that complicate things.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels resentful because he's working hard and she's not pulling her weight. His jealousy over her social activities might be a red flag\u2014maybe he's projecting his own feelings onto her. However, his concerns about her not finding a job quickly and her disrespectful behavior are valid issues. The ex's response of attacking him instead of addressing his concerns could indicate a pattern of defensiveness or poor communication.\n\nConsidering the dynamics, the author's intent to help her while also wanting more time with his son might be a conflict of interest. His conditions for her staying could be seen as a way to control the situation, which might be unfair. However, if she's not meeting those conditions, he's within his rights to ask her to leave if it's a private living arrangement. The key question is whether the conditions he set were clear and reasonable from the start. If he verbally agreed to six months, but she's not meeting the terms, he might have the right to end the arrangement early, especially if there's no written agreement.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think he's being too controlling or not considering her struggles. But I need to weigh the facts. The ex isn't fulfilling her part of the informal agreement, and the author is justified in feeling upset. However, the author might have set unrealistic expectations without considering her circumstances. Also, the jealousy and resentment he feels could be personal issues affecting his judgment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have issues. The author might be overstepping by expecting her to find a job quickly and adhere to house rules without a formal agreement. The ex isn't meeting the agreed-upon terms and is acting disrespectfully. However, the author's primary motivation for letting her stay was to see his son more, which could indicate he's using a kindness gesture to benefit himself, which might not be fair. \n\nLegally, the author can ask her to leave if it's a lease agreement, but if it's a verbal agreement with conditions, the situation is murky. The mother could argue that the author can't enforce those terms without a contract. But since it's his home, he can set rules for guests, and if she's not a tenant, he can ask her to leave at any time. The problem arises when the child's custody is involved. If the ex uses this as leverage to restrict visitation, it could become a legal battle over the child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about her not meeting the conditions and her disrespectful behavior, his initial offer might have been unclear, leading to a misunderstanding. The ex's behavior is problematic, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict. However, since it's his home, he has the right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not adhering to the agreed terms. The key is whether the terms were clearly communicated. The author isn't in the wrong if the conditions were mutual and she's not fulfilling them. However, the mixed motives and lack of a formal agreement complicate things. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's within his rights to set boundaries in his own home, especially if she's not meeting agreed-upon terms, and his concerns are legitimate.\n"
