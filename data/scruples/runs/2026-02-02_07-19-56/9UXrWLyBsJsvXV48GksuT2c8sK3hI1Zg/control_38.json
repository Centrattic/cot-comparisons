We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the father wanting to kick his son's mother out of his house after she moved in under certain conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex and the ex's mom (not Karen) broke up, then she moved in with him to help her get back on her feet. The father offered her a place to stay if she helped around the house, found a job, etc. She accepted. But she didn't clean up her son's room initially, took a month and a half to find a job, partied a lot, and when confronted, she attacked him. Now he wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he said she could stay for six months and fears she might try to block his access to his son.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the father's intentions: he wanted to help her get a job and see his son more. He's paying for rent and living expenses. She's supposed to help around the house and find a job. She took a month and a half to find a job, which he considers dragging her feet. She's partying and not being a good role model. When he confronts her, she attacks him with lies. He feels wronged and wants her out.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Intentions and Conditions**: Did he set clear expectations? He said she had to help out and find a job. If she didn't meet those conditions, maybe it's reasonable to ask her to leave. But he gave her six months\u2014has she not met the terms even then?\n\n2. **Her Behavior**: She's not fulfilling her end of the deal. She's not working, partying, and being disrespectful. That's a problem. But he also admitted part of his motivation was to see his son more, which complicates things. Is that his fault?\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: When he brings up the issues, she attacks him. Maybe there's a pattern of her not taking responsibility. That could justify his frustration.\n\n4. **Legal and Parental Rights**: If they have a time-sharing agreement, can he legally kick her out without affecting visitation? Also, the fear that she might retaliate and block his access to the child. But if she's not fulfilling her part, maybe he's justified in ending the arrangement.\n\n5. **Moral Responsibility**: Did he have an obligation to help her? He offered help, but she didn't meet the conditions. He's paying for everything, so maybe it's fair to stop supporting her if she's not pulling her weight.\n\nPotential counterpoints: He might be using the child as leverage. By keeping her in the house, he might be trying to maintain access to the kid. But he also has the right to set boundaries. Also, her behavior is concerning as a mother, which might affect the child. He's trying to get her to be a better parent. But if she's not meeting her responsibilities, maybe it's right to end the arrangement.\n\nAlso, she was supposed to help around the house, but she didn't clean for weeks. Then cleaned after being bothered. That's part of the problem. Not contributing to household chores as agreed.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if he set terms and she didn't meet them, he's not in the wrong for wanting to end it. Also, her disrespectful behavior and attacks on him are valid reasons for him to feel justified. However, if he gave her a specific timeframe (six months), maybe he should honor that. But if she's not meeting the terms, it's not unreasonable to end it earlier.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She didn't meet the conditions he set, and her behavior was disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
