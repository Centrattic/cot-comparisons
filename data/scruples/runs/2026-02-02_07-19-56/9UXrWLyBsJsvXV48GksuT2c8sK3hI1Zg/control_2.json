We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a man who is letting his ex-girlfriend, who has his child, stay at his house. They had a breakup, and now she's living with him to get back on her feet. He offers her a place to stay with conditions like helping around the house and finding a job. She moves in, but she's not meeting his expectations. She's been messy, slow to get a job, and partying a lot. He's upset because he's working hard, covering all the child expenses, and feels she's not acting like a responsible mother. When he confronts her, she insults him and attacks his character, leading him to want to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since they're in a time-sharing agreement, the mother has visitation rights. If she moves in with him, does that affect custody? Maybe not directly, but if he kicks her out, could she use that to claim he's not following the agreement? The post mentions he's worried she might try to block him from his son, which is a real concern. He should be cautious to not violate any custody arrangements.\n\nThen there's the moral/ethical side. He offered her help with the condition that she works and contributes. She agreed but didn't meet those conditions. However, staying in someone's house and partying instead of working might be a breach of the informal agreement. But is that grounds for kicking her out? He also mentions jealousy, which complicates things. His motivations might be mixed\u2014helping her and wanting more time with his son. If she's not fulfilling her part, maybe he's justified in ending the arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's not working as expected, isn't contributing, and attacks him when he brings it up. That's disrespectful and uncooperative. However, he allowed her to stay under certain terms, and if she's not meeting them, he might have a right to end the arrangement. But he also needs to be careful not to disrupt the child's access, as per the time-sharing agreement. If she moves out, does that affect his access to the child? Maybe she could retaliate, but that's her choice.\n\nLegally, unless there's a formal agreement in place, it's hard to say. If this is a lease or a formal arrangement, different rules apply. But since it's a private agreement between ex-partners, it's more about their mutual consent. If he offered her a temporary stay with conditions, and she's breaking them, he can end it. However, if the child's custody is involved, he needs to ensure that kicking her out doesn't interfere with the child's time-sharing. If she's the custodial parent, he can't just cut her off access to the child. He needs to be careful not to do something that could be seen as interfering with custody.\n\nEmotionally, he's frustrated. She's not contributing, and her behavior is problematic. His jealousy is a red flag because it's not about the child's best interest. But his main point is about her not meeting the conditions he set. If she's not working, not helping around the house, and disrespecting him, then ending the arrangement might be justified. But he also needs to consider the child's well-being. If she's the primary caregiver, moving her out could affect the child's stability.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's following the terms of their agreement and she's not, then maybe he's not. However, if he's using this as a way to gain more time with the child or retaliate against her, that could be problematic. The key points are: Did he have a valid agreement with her? If she violated the terms, then he can end it. But he mustn't interfere with the child's custody as per the legal agreement. The fact that she might retaliate is a risk, but he isn't in the wrong if he's acting within the agreed terms. However, if he didn't have a clear agreement, maybe he's overstepping. Also, his jealousy and wanting more time with the kid might be clouding his judgment, which complicates things. But legally and morally, if she's not meeting the conditions he set, he's not entirely in the wrong to end the arrangement. However, he should be cautious about how he does it to avoid legal issues with custody.\n"
