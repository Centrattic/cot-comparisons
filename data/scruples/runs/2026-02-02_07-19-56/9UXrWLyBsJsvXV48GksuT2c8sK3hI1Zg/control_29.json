We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for wanting to kick out his son's mother, who he allowed to live with him under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, the situation: After their breakup, the ex allows the mother to stay in his house to help her get back on her feet, partly to see his son more. The mother agreed to help around the house, find a job, etc. But she hasn't been helpful\u2014left a mess, took a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot. When OP confronts her, she attacks him and lies about him. Now he wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months and fears retaliation affecting custody.\n\nSo, is OP in the wrong? Let's break it down. The ex offered a living arrangement with conditions. The mother didn't meet those conditions. OP is frustrated with her behavior and feels disrespected. He's also worried about custody issues. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they had a formal agreement for six months, he might need to honor it unless she violated terms. But since the setup was informal, he can probably set boundaries. However, the mother's actions might be affecting the child's well-being if she's not fulfilling her parental responsibilities. But OP allowed her to stay under the premise of helping her. If she's not meeting those terms, ending the arrangement isn't necessarily wrong. However, the motivation part where OP admits it's partly about seeing his son more might complicate things emotionally. \n\nOn the emotional side, the mother's behavior is concerning. If she's neglecting responsibilities and being disrespectful, OP has a right to protect his living environment. But the fear of her retaliating in custody is real. The key here is whether OP's actions are within the bounds of their agreement and if he's acting in the child's best interest. Since he's providing support but she's not reciprocating, and she's been disrespectful, his desire to end the arrangement isn't unreasonable. \n\nHowever, the fact that he allowed her to stay under a time frame (six months) and now wants to end it earlier might be seen as a breach unless there were specific terms. But since the setup was informal and the mother didn't meet her part, OP isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), as he's not at fault for wanting to end the arrangement when the other party didn't uphold their end.\n"
