We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup, a time-sharing agreement, the ex-partner moving in, and now the author wants to kick her out.\n\nFirst, the author offered the ex a place to stay with the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets her life together. The ex agreed. But she took a long time to get a job, partied a lot, and didn't keep the house clean. The author is upset and wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he made a six-month promise. Also, he's worried about retaliation affecting his time with the kid.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's been paying child support, working full-time, and trying to be supportive. But the ex isn't meeting the conditions he set. However, the setup wasn't a formal agreement, just a verbal offer. The ex's behavior is a problem, but the author's motivations were partly to see his son more. The ex's response to feedback was attacking him, which is hurtful.\n\nNow, determining fault. The author's initial offer to house her was conditional, and she didn't meet those expectations. However, he might not have a legal obligation to keep her there since it wasn't a formal lease. But if he made a promise, breaking it could be seen as unethical. Also, the ex's behavior is poor, but the author's desire to retaliate could lead to a cycle of conflict. The key points are whether the author is within his rights to end the arrangement and if his actions are justified given the circumstances. Since it's a personal arrangement without legal binding, he's probably not in the wrong for ending it, but the way he handles it matters. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
