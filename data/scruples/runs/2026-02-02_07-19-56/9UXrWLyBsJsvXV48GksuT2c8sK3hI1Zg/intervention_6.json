We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user and their ex moved out a couple of years ago. They had a time-sharing agreement, and the user was helping the ex find a job by taking more days with their son and paying for childcare. The user hasn't missed any child support and has been working full-time, covering all the kid's expenses. Then, the ex couldn't afford rent because she didn't have a steady job. The user offered her to stay at their place with conditions: helping around the house, finding a job, and getting back on her feet. The user would cover rent and living expenses. The ex accepted, but the user admitted they did this partly to see their son more often.\n\nNow, after a few weeks, the ex's behavior was messy, left things in the son's room, and took a month and a half to find a job. She spent time partying, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriend's, and vacations. The user is upset because they think she's not acting like a responsible mother and feels jealous since they can't do those things. The user confronted her, and she attacked them with lies, making the user feel like a deadbeat. The user wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting their access to the son. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is at fault. Let me consider both sides. The user helped the ex by letting her stay under certain conditions, which the ex didn't fully meet. The user is working hard, paying support, and wants to see their son more. However, the user also admitted part of the reason for letting her stay was to see the son more, which might complicate things. The ex's behavior is questionable\u2014taking a long time to find a job, partying, not maintaining the living space. But the user allowed her to stay for six months, and now wants to kick her out before that period.\n\nLegally, if this is a housing arrangement without a formal contract, the user can likely ask her to leave, but the ex might have some claims if there was an agreement. Emotionally, the user's frustration is understandable, but they might need to consider the child's well-being. If the mother isn't meeting her responsibilities, that could affect the child. However, the user's motivation to see the son more often might not be entirely selfless, which could affect their judgment. The ex's response was hostile and lying, which is not good, but the user's reaction of wanting to kick her out might be a way to avoid confrontation or to protect their own time with the child.\n\nI think the user isn't entirely at fault. They provided support, but the conditions weren't met. The ex's behavior is problematic. However, the user's initial offer might have been more about their own desires, which could lead to bias. The user should probably address the issues through proper legal means if possible, ensuring the child's best interest. But in terms of moral responsibility, the user isn't in the wrong because the ex didn't follow through on her end of the deal. However, the user's jealousy and the fact that part of their offer was self-serving might make them less than entirely in the right. But given the circumstances, I think the answer is that the user isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
