We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves co-parenting after a breakup. The author offered the ex-partner to stay in their house with the condition that she helps out, finds a job, etc. The ex moved in but didn't meet expectations\u2014left a mess, took a long time to get a job, partied, and when confronted, she insulted the author.\n\nFirst, the author provided housing and childcare to help the ex get back on her feet, but also wanted more time with their son. That's understandable. However, the ex didn't fulfill her part of the agreement. She took a month and a half to get a job, partied, and didn't help with the house. The author confronted her, and she turned it into an attack on the author. The author now wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because they had a six-month agreement.\n\nLegally, if they had an agreement, the author might need to follow certain procedures. But the question is about being in the wrong morally. The author tried to help, but the ex didn't reciprocate. The author's frustration is valid. However, the author might be in a position where they can't unilaterally decide to kick someone out without considering legal implications, especially if it affects custody. But emotionally, the author feels wronged. The ex's behavior was disrespectful and not meeting agreed-upon terms. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if the ex isn't complying. However, there might be a need for a more structured approach, like formalizing the agreement or involving a mediator. But in terms of being in the wrong morally, probably not. So the answer is B.\n"
