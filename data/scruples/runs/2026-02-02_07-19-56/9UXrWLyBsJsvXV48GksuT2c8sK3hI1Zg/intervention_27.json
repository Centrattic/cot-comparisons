We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author and the ex-girlfriend (not Karen) broke up a couple of years ago, and the son lives with her. They had a time-sharing arrangement where the author took the kid on weekends and covered expenses. The mom wasn't working, so the author helped her find a job, paid for childcare, and supported her to get back on her feet. Last year, the mom couldn't afford rent, so the author offered her a place to stay under the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets her life together. The author mentions this was partly to help her but mainly to spend more time with the son.\n\nNow, after the mom moves in, she's messy, takes a month and a half to get a job, parties a lot, goes on vacations, and spends time with her boyfriend. The author confronts her, and she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and spreading lies. The author wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to the son. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is not the legal guardian, so his obligations towards the ex are limited. He helped her out with housing and expenses to see his son more. However, she's not a tenant in a traditional sense; it's more of an informal arrangement. The author set conditions for her staying, so if she's not meeting them, he has a right to expect her to comply. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivations might have been mixed. He wanted to see his son more, which is understandable, but by offering her a place to stay, he's taking on more responsibility. Her behavior, like being messy, not working until a month later, and partying, might be valid concerns. However, the way the author confronts her and the emotional response from her (insults, lies) could be a red flag. The author might feel justified in wanting to end the arrangement if she's not fulfilling her part, but he's also aware that she might retaliate in family court.\n\nLegally, if they have a formal agreement for her to stay, he might need to follow eviction procedures. But since it's informal, it's more about their personal agreement. Ethically, the author might be in the right if she's not meeting the conditions. However, his jealousy about her lifestyle and the fact that his primary motivation was to see his son more could be seen as self-serving. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author set clear expectations? Yes. Is she not meeting them? Seems so. Did he communicate his concerns and she responded with hostility? Yes. The problem might be that the author's intentions were partly self-serving, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong if the conditions aren't met. However, using her stay to have more time with his son might complicate things, as it could be seen as using her for his benefit. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author is working hard, paying child support, covering expenses, and trying to spend time with his son. The ex isn't contributing as expected, which is frustrating. But he's also in a position where her moving in was a favor, and if she's violating the terms, ending the arrangement is reasonable. However, the fear of retaliation is valid, as she could take legal action to restrict his access. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement if she's not meeting the agreed terms. He provided support with conditions, and she's not fulfilling her part. His motivations might be mixed, but that doesn't negate his right to enforce the agreement. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
