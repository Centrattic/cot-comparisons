We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between a father and the mother of his child. They have a time-sharing agreement, and the mother moves in with the father after struggling with rent. The father offers her a place to stay under certain conditions, mainly to see his son more often. However, the mother isn't meeting his expectations\u2014she's not working enough, she's partying, and when he brings it up, she attacks him. Now, he wants to kick her out but feels bad because he promised six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child custody and visitation rights are usually determined by the court, and the mother might have legal standing to prevent the father from limiting visitation. If the father kicks her out, she could potentially fight that in court, affecting his access to his son. That's a key point here.\n\nNext, the father's motivations. He admitted to helping her partly to see his son more. That's a bit self-serving, but not necessarily wrong. However, by allowing her to stay under conditions, he might have created a living arrangement that isn't formalized. If there's no legal agreement, he might have the right to ask her to leave, but if she's there under some kind of informal agreement, it's more complicated.\n\nThe mother's behavior is also a factor. She's not meeting the work conditions, and she's disrespectful. But she was in a vulnerable position when she agreed to stay. The father's reaction to her partying and lack of job search could be seen as controlling, especially if he's using the child's care as leverage.\n\nEmotionally, the father feels hurt and taken advantage of. His son's well-being is important, and the mother's actions might affect that. However, if he kicks her out, it could lead to legal issues over custody. He might be in the wrong because he allowed her to stay under conditions he's now exploiting. The initial offer to help her was self-serving, and he might not have considered the legal implications of her moving in.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father has a right to his own living space and to set boundaries. However, the mother's rights as a parent might interfere. The key issue is whether the father's decision to let her stay was a private agreement that doesn't affect the child custody arrangement. If the mother is living there as part of her custody arrangement, then he can't just kick her out without legal repercussions.\n\nSo, the father's actions could be seen as self-serving and potentially undermining the mother's rights. He's using the situation to his advantage, and now when it's not going his way, he wants out. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the father's initial agreement and his self-serving motives might make him the one in the wrong.\n"
