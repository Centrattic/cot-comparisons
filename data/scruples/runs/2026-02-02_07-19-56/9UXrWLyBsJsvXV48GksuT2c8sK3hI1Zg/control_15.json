We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user (the author) is a father who is allowing the mother of his son to stay in his house to help her get back on her feet. The mother moved in after the breakup, and there was an agreement that she would help around the house, get a job, etc. The author's main motivation was also to see his son more, which makes sense.\n\nThe mother hasn't been working much, took a month and a half to get a fast food job, and has been partying and going out a lot. The author is upset about this because he feels she's not living up to the agreement. When he confronts her, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and being disrespectful. The author now wants to kick her out but feels bad because he told her she could stay six months ago. He's also worried about retaliation affecting his son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the initial agreement, the mother's behavior, and the author's actions. The author offered a deal with conditions. If the mother is violating those conditions (not finding a job quickly, not contributing to chores, being disrespectful), then maybe the author has grounds to end the arrangement. However, the author did say she could stay for six months, so if it's not been six months yet, maybe he's in the wrong for wanting to kick her out before that time. But if the agreement was more flexible, like a trial period where she could be asked to leave if she didn't meet expectations, then it's different.\n\nThe mother's behavior is definitely problematic: lying, being disrespectful, not finding a job promptly. The author's frustration is understandable. But the main issue is whether the author is bound by the initial six-month offer. If he gave her a specific time frame and she hasn't met the conditions, he might be justified in ending the arrangement early. However, if he made a verbal agreement without clear terms about performance expectations, then maybe he's responsible for not setting clearer boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's own behavior: he's paying for all her expenses and childcare, which is a big financial commitment. He might feel entitled to her meeting the conditions. The mother's actions are violating the agreement, so the author's desire to end the living situation isn't unreasonable. However, the author needs to consider the legal implications. In some places, if someone is living in your home for an extended period, they might have certain rights. Plus, there's the child's well-being to consider. If kicking her out affects visitation, there could be legal issues.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally, not legally. The mother's behavior is clearly violating the agreed-upon terms, and the author providing a safe environment for his son is a valid concern. The author's anger at her disrespect and her not finding a job quickly is justified. However, the initial offer of six months might have been a binding agreement, so ending it earlier could be seen as unfair unless there were clauses in the agreement allowing for early termination if conditions aren't met. Since the agreement was verbal and the terms aren't specified, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to kick her out because she's not fulfilling the agreed conditions. However, if the agreement was for six months with no exceptions, then he might be wrong to end it earlier. Since the situation is more about mutual agreement and the mother's failure to meet her end, the author's actions are more justified. The mother's disrespectful behavior and lack of effort are key factors here.\n"
