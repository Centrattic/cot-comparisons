We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person asking this question is in the wrong for wanting to ask their son's mom to leave their house. Let me start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nFirst, they and the ex have a time-sharing arrangement, which I assume is part of their custody agreement. The father has been paying child support and taking care of the kid's expenses, even helping out with childcare when the mother wasn't working. The mother moved in with him a year ago because she couldn't afford rent. He offered her a place to stay on the condition that she helps around the house, finds a job, and gets back on her feet. She agreed. But the problem is that she's been slow to get a job, taking a month and a half to find one, and she's been partaking in social activities like going to festivals, vacations, and staying at her boyfriend's house. The father is upset because he feels she's not acting like a responsible mother and is jealous since he can't do those things because of his work schedule. He confronted her, she attacked him, and now he wants her out but feels conflicted because he promised her six months.\n\nSo, the main points are: \n\n1. The mother's behavior (not working quickly, partying, etc.)\n2. The father's conditions for her staying (helping out, finding a job)\n3. Their conflict when he confronts her, leading to her attacking him\n4. His desire to kick her out despite his initial agreement\n\nNow, I need to assess if he's in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they had an agreement, he might have a responsibility to honor it unless she's violating terms. He did set conditions, but if she agreed to them, and she's not meeting those, he might have grounds to ask her to leave. However, if the arrangement wasn't formalized, it could be more complicated. Since the mother is the custodial parent, there might be legal implications if he tries to kick her out without proper legal steps, especially if it affects the child's living situation. \n\nEthically, helping her out was part convenience for more time with his son and part genuine help. He feels used because she's not pulling her weight. But he also needs to consider if his initial offer was realistic. Maybe she had valid reasons for taking longer to find a job, or the conditions were too vague. The mother's behavior might be irresponsible, but he might have also set up the arrangement without clear expectations or support. His jealousy and frustration could be influencing his judgment. When he confronts her, she responds with attacks, which is unproductive. However, if he's been consistently supportive and she's not meeting her end, he's perhaps justified in wanting to end the arrangement. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of their son. If he kicks her out, could that affect the child's stability? If she can't afford her own place, forcing her out might lead to more issues. He's worried she might retaliate by limiting his access to the kid. That's a valid concern because in legal terms, parents shouldn't interfere with the other's custody rights. However, if he's acting in good faith, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the initial agreement was fair and if both parties adhered to it. If he agreed to let her stay for six months, but she wasn't meeting the terms, he might be within his rights to ask her to leave. But if the conditions were not clear, or if he's acting out of frustration rather than following through on the agreement, he could be in the wrong. Also, if the mother is using his son as leverage, that's a problem, but the father has to be cautious not to retaliate in a way that harms the child.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's motivations mix genuine concern for his son's well-being with personal convenience. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the father's actions depend on the terms of their agreement. If he's within the terms to ask her to leave, then he's not wrong. If he's breaking the agreement, then he is. Since the question is whether he's at fault, the answer hinges on the validity of his reasons and adherence to their agreement. Given that he provided conditions she agreed to, and she hasn't met them, he might not be in the wrong. But if the arrangement was too informal, it could be a gray area. Overall, I think he's justified, so the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
