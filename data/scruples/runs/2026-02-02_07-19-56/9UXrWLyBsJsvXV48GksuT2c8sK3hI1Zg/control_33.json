We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-partner (the author's ex, the son's mom) moving in with him after a breakup, and now he wants to kick her out because of her behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex-wife moved in to get back on her feet, and he offered her a deal where he covers expenses if she helps out and finds a job. She took a month and a half to get a job, and in the meantime, partied a lot. The author is frustrated with her behavior and feels she's disrespectful. He also mentions that when he confronts her, she attacks him with lies, which hurts him.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is providing a living situation and financial support to his ex-wife with the expectation that she would contribute and find a job. She didn't meet those expectations immediately, and her behavior (partying, not working, being disrespectful) is causing him stress. He wants to kick her out but is worried about custody issues. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since she's not his family anymore but his child's mother, there might be complexities. However, the question is more about moral wrongness rather than legality. Legally, he might need to ensure that removing her doesn't affect his custody rights or her responsibilities. But the AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect is about whether his actions are justified morally.\n\nThe author has been paying child support consistently and taking care of the child's expenses. He allowed her to stay under certain conditions. If she violated those conditions by not contributing and being disrespectful, then his wanting to kick her out could be seen as his right. However, he did offer her a six-month period, and she might still be within that timeframe. \n\nOn the other hand, she did accept the offer with the understanding that she could stay for six months. If she hasn't met the terms (helping out, finding a job), maybe the author has grounds to reconsider. But he's also using the time to see his son more, which he admitted part of his motivation wasn't purely selfless. \n\nThe mother's behavior (not working, parting, disrespect) seems problematic. The author's frustration is valid. However, when he confronts her, she retaliates with lies and attacks him. That makes her behavior worse. So, the author's desire to remove her might be a reaction to her violating the agreed-upon terms.\n\nThere's a balance between holding someone accountable and acting out of spite. If the author is doing it because she's not meeting the conditions he set (helping around the house, finding a job), then he's not in the wrong. But if it's out of jealousy or spite, maybe there's a problem. However, the user's reasoning seems to center around her not fulfilling her part of the agreement, which makes his action justified.\n\nAnother angle: The author is providing a living situation, which is a significant favor. The ex-wife isn't fulfilling her end, so he's trying to correct that. The fact that she's being disrespectful and uncooperative adds to the justification. The mother's actions (partying, not working) could be seen as neglecting her responsibilities as a parent and a tenant. \n\nBut the author should also consider the child's well-being. If she's the custodial parent and he kicks her out, it might impact the child's stability. However, the situation is that she moved in with him, so maybe the living arrangement is supposed to help both of them. If she's not holding up her end, he's within his rights to reassess.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, since the mother is violating the terms and being disrespectful, the author isn't the asshole. He's trying to hold her accountable for her actions, which he set clear expectations for. The key here is that he offered her a chance under specific conditions, and she didn't meet them. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to remove her.\n"
