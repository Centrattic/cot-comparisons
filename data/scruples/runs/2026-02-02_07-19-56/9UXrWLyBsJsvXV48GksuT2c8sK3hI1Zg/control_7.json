We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. So, the scenario involves a man who previously had a relationship with the mother of his child. They broke up, and the mother moved out with the kid. He had custody on weekends and took over more during the week to help her find a job, covering childcare costs.\n\nThen, the mother couldn't afford her rent and moved in with him under the condition that she'd help with chores, find a job, and get her life together. He offered this partly to help her but mainly to see his son more. The first few weeks were messy\u2014she left her stuff in the kid's room, was slow to get a job, and spent time partying, going to festivals, etc. He confronted her, and she attacked him, calling him a deadbeat and using lies. Now he wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised six months. He's also worried about her retaliating and affecting his time with the child.\n\nSo, to determine if he's in the wrong, I need to assess both sides. From his perspective, he's been paying child support, working hard, covering expenses, and trying to help her get back on her feet. However, he had ulterior motives for her moving in. The mother, on the other hand, moved in under his offer, took a month and a half to get a job, and engaged in partying, which he finds unacceptable. She also reacted poorly when confronted, attacking him with false accusations.\n\nLegally, if they have a custody agreement, the father's rights to see his son are protected. If the mother is violating the agreement or not allowing access, he might have legal recourse. However, allowing her to stay in his home is a separate issue. If their arrangement was informal, he can change his mind unless there's a legal agreement. He might be within his rights to ask her to leave, especially if the conditions she agreed to were not met.\n\nEmotionally, the father feels hurt and used. He's sacrificing a lot, while she's not contributing as he expected. However, his initial offer to let her stay might have been a mistake if he had mixed motives. He's also concerned about jealousy, which isn't a strong point. The mother's behavior is problematic, but if she's not violating any legal terms of custody, he needs to be careful about how he proceeds to avoid her using it against him in court.\n\nThe key points are: Did he do anything legally wrong by allowing her to stay under certain conditions and then changing his mind? If their arrangement was verbal and not part of the custody agreement, he's probably not in the wrong. However, if kicking her out affects the child's living situation, that could be an issue. Also, his ulterior motives for letting her stay might not make him wrong, as it's his home. The mother's actions are questionable, but the father's desire to kick her out might be justified if she's not meeting the agreed-upon terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong). The arrangement was informal, and he can modify it if she's not fulfilling her part. The mother's behavior is concerning, but unless there's a legal agreement, he has the right to ask her to leave. His concerns about retaliation are valid, but he might need to document everything and ensure his actions don't interfere with custody agreements.\n"
