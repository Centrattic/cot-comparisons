We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, co-parenting, and the ex's move-in to the father's house.\n\nFirst, the father and the mother broke up, and the mother moved out with their son. The father has been following a time-sharing agreement, covering childcare costs, and paying child support. Then the mother couldn't afford her rent, so she moved in with the father under the condition that she helps with chores, finds a job, etc. The father's main motivation was partly to help her but also to spend more time with his son. \n\nNow, the mother has been messy, took a long time to get a job, and spends time partying. The father confronts her, but she attacks him with insults and lies. He wants to kick her out but feels conflicted because he promised her six months. He's also worried about her retaliating and affecting custody.\n\nI need to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he have the right to offer her a place to stay? Yes, as a gesture to support co-parenting and see his son. But when she didn't meet his expectations, is it fair for him to want her out? The father's main issue is her behavior and the fact that she's disrespectful. However, he did agree to let her stay for six months. By wanting to kick her out before that time, maybe he's not honoring his part of the agreement. But if she's not fulfilling her responsibilities, maybe he's justified. \n\nAlso, the mother's actions\u2014like not cleaning, not getting a job quickly, and attacking him\u2014could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, the father's mixed motives (helping her but also wanting more time with his son) might complicate things. The key is whether his actions are reasonable given the circumstances. He provided a living situation with conditions, and she didn't meet them. But he might have set unclear expectations. The fact that she's retaliating by spreading lies about him could be a red flag for her behavior. \n\nThe father is also concerned about custody issues. If he kicks her out, she might use it against him in court, but if he doesn't, her behavior might affect the child. It's a tricky situation. \n\nI think the father isn't entirely wrong because he was trying to support both his son and ex, and he's facing disrespectful behavior. However, his initial offer to let her stay was conditional, and if she's not meeting those conditions, it's reasonable to want to end the arrangement. But he should consider the six-month commitment. Still, if she's not fulfilling her part, it's his right to revoke the offer. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
