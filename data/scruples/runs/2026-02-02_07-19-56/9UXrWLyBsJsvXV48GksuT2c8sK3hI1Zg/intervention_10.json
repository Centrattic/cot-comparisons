We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story involves a man who wants to kick his ex-partner out of his house. They had a breakup, she moved out with their son, and they had a time-sharing agreement. He helped her find a job and let her stay with him to see his son more often. Now, he's upset because she's not working enough, partying, and being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If she's staying with him under an agreement, maybe there's a lease or some understanding. If he offered her a place with certain conditions, like helping around the house and finding a job, but didn't formalize it, he might have a hard time enforcing that. However, if it's a verbal agreement, he might still be able to ask her to leave, especially if she's violating the terms.\n\nEmotionally, he feels used because he's working hard, covering expenses, and she's not contributing. He's also jealous of her social activities, which might be a personal issue. When he confronts her, she attacks him, which he finds hurtful. He's considering kicking her out but is worried about losing visitation rights with his son.\n\nLegally, in many places, if someone is a tenant, even if they're a family member, the landlord can't just kick them out without following proper procedures. If she's staying there as a guest or under a lease that she's a co-tenant, he might need to go through the legal process. If he's the sole tenant, he might have more authority, but if she's considered a tenant, he can't just remove her without notice. Also, child custody agreements might affect visitation. If the ex wants to restrict his time with the child, there could be legal repercussions if he retaliates.\n\nEthically, he might feel justified if she's not meeting her responsibilities. But he did offer the arrangement with the intention of seeing his son more, so maybe his motives are mixed. Her behavior might be disrespectful, but his response could affect their child. He should consider the child's well-being and the potential legal consequences if he kicks her out and she fights for custody or visitation changes.\n\nHe also mentioned she's been like this before, attacking him when he brings up issues. That pattern could indicate a problem in their communication and conflict resolution. However, that doesn't necessarily make him right to retaliate by kicking her out. He needs to think about the best way to handle this, perhaps through mediation or legal channels rather than unilateral action.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), people might argue that he's not in the wrong if she's violating the agreement, but if his actions could harm his relationship with his son, that's a problem. Alternatively, if he's not following the legal procedures to evict her, he might be the one at fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong if the agreement is in place and she's breaking it, but he needs to handle it properly to avoid legal issues.\n"
