We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup between the author and the mother of his son, and now she's living with him. Let me outline the key points.\n\nFirst, after the breakup, the author had a time-sharing agreement, paid child support, and even took on more childcare so the ex could work. That seems responsible. Then, the ex couldn't afford rent, so the author offered her a place to stay with conditions: helping out, finding a job, and covering her expenses. The author's motivation was partly to see his son more, which is understandable but not necessarily wrong.\n\nWhen she moved in, she left a mess in the son's room, which he found problematic. She took over a month and a half to get a job, partied a lot, and the author feels she's not acting like a responsible parent. He confronts her, she becomes defensive, insults him, and accuses him of being a deadbeat, which he denies. Now he wants to kick her out but is worried about retaliation affecting his access to his son.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's consider both sides. The author offered a living arrangement with clear conditions. The ex didn't meet those conditions: slow to find a job, not helping around the house, and engaging in social activities that the author sees as irresponsible. The author communicated his concerns, which the ex responded to with attacks, not addressing the issues.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they had a verbal agreement (six months), the author might need to follow proper procedures to evict her, but the question is about moral wrong, not legal. Morally, if he set conditions and she didn't meet them, he's not in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. However, he might be overstepping if the conditions weren't explicitly agreed upon. Also, the author's jealousy about not having time to socialize while she does might be a red flag. But the main issue is her not fulfilling her part of the deal and the disrespectful behavior during communication.\n\nThe ex's actions\u2014lying, attacking him, not contributing\u2014could justify the author wanting to kick her out. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
