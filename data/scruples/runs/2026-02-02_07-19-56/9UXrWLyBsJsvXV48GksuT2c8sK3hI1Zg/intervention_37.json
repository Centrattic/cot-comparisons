We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man wanting to kick out his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his son, from his house. They broke up a couple of years ago, and she moved out with the kid. They had a time-sharing agreement where he had the child on weekends and covered childcare during the week so she could find a job. Now, she's struggling with rent, so she moves in with him under the condition that she helps around the house and finds a job. The author's main reason for this arrangement was to see his son more, and he also wanted to help her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms they agreed upon. He offered her a place to stay if she found a job and helped with chores. She found a job eventually but took a month and a half, which the author sees as slow. She also spends time partying and on vacations, which he finds unacceptable. He confronted her, and she retaliated by calling him a deadbeat and lying about his behavior.\n\nNow, the author wants to kick her out, but he feels bad because he promised six months. He's also worried about her retaliating by taking away his access to his son. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points:\n\n1. **Agreement Terms**: He gave her conditions. She agreed to help around the house and find a job. She found a job eventually but took longer than he liked. However, she did find a job, so maybe she's partially meeting her end. The time it took to find a job might be within reasonable time frames depending on location and job market.\n\n2. **Behavior Issues**: She's partying, going on vacations, etc. The author is upset because he's working hard and she's not. But is this enough to kick her out? If she's fulfilling her part by working, maybe her personal time is her own unless the agreement specified restrictions on her activities.\n\n3. **Communication and Conflict**: When he confronts her, she attacks him. He feels disrespected. However, his initial offer might have been conditional on her behavior, but if he didn't specify boundaries about her personal time, it's hard to hold her accountable for that.\n\n4. **Intentions**: The author admitted he wanted to see his son more by having her stay. That's understandable, but maybe he should have considered her needs and boundaries more.\n\n5. **Legal and Parenting Considerations**: If she's the custodial parent, he needs to ensure his actions don't interfere with his access to his child. Kicking her out might affect the child, and legally, he might need to be cautious about how he handles the situation to avoid jeopardizing his visitation rights.\n\n6. **Emotional vs. Practical Grounds**: The author's frustration is valid, but is it fair to kick someone out based on personal lifestyle choices unless they violate the agreement? If the agreement was about her finding a job and helping around the house, and she's doing that, maybe his issues with her social life are his personal grievances, not a breach of the agreement.\n\n7. **Retaliation Concerns**: He's worried she'll retaliate. He should consider legal steps or mediation to formalize any agreement to protect his rights.\n\nPutting this all together, the author might not be in the wrong if the agreement's terms were not fully met. However, if she's fulfilling the key conditions (job and chores), his reasons for wanting her out might be more about personal dissatisfaction rather than her breaching the agreement. Also, his own intentions for wanting her there for more time with the child might make his position less clear. The ex's behavior could be problematic, but without a clear violation of their agreement, the author might be acting on emotional grounds. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being clear on expectations and for possibly overstepping by considering eviction without a valid breach.\n"
