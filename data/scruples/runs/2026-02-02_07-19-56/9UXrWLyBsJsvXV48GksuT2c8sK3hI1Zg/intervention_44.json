We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father letting his ex live with him to see their son more often, but now he wants to kick her out because she's not taking responsibilities seriously.\n\nFirst, the father agreed to let her stay for six months. He helped her find a job, paid for childcare and living expenses. But she's been messy, taking too long to get a job, and partying. He's upset and feels she's not being a good mother. Then, when he confronts her, she attacks him and lies. Now he wants her out, but he's worried about retaliation affecting his time with the son.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. Did he make a deal to let her stay for six months? Yes. He might be breaking that agreement if he kicks her out before the time is up. That's a point against him. Also, he admitted he had ulterior motives\u2014helping her was 50%, wanting to see his son more 50%. That might not be fair to her, but maybe not his fault.\n\nOn the other hand, she's not taking responsibilities seriously. She didn't clean up, took a long time to get a job, partied. He's working hard and feels disrespected. When he tried to address it, she attacked him. That's a problem. She's being disrespectful, which he has a right to be upset about. But he's not the one who's a deadbeat\u2014his support for the child is good. \n\nBut the key is the agreement. He told her she could stay six months. If he breaks that now, maybe he's in the wrong. However, if she's not fulfilling her part (getting a job, helping around the house), maybe the agreement was conditional. Did he set clear terms when she moved in? If he required her to find a job and help, and she's not doing that, then maybe it's justified to end the arrangement early. \n\nBut he didn't specify in the question whether there were conditions. He just said he offered her to stay if she found a job and helped. So maybe the agreement was conditional. If she's not meeting those conditions, then he's not in the wrong for ending it. However, he should have addressed the terms from the start. \n\nAlso, the mother's behavior\u2014partying, not working\u2014is bad, but does that mean he can kick her out? It's his home, so he does have the right to ask her to leave unless there's a legal agreement. But since it's a personal agreement, not a lease, he can change his mind. Legally, maybe he's allowed. But morally, if he made a promise to let her stay for six months, breaking it now might be seen as wrong, especially if she's relying on that. \n\nBut considering the mother's behavior and the fact that she attacked him when he tried to talk, he might have a valid reason. The mother isn't fulfilling her part, and the father is justified in ending the arrangement. So in that case, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut the user thinks he's in the wrong. Maybe because he didn't follow through on the six-month promise. But if the terms were not met, then it's okay. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is the agreement's conditions. If he was clear about her responsibilities, then she's at fault. If he wasn't, then maybe he's in the wrong for not being upfront. \n\nSince the father admitted he wanted to help her but also wanted more time with the son, that might make it a bit self-serving, but that's part of the situation. The main issue is whether he's breaking the agreement by kicking her out early. If the agreement was six months with no conditions, then he's in the wrong. But if he made it conditional on her actions, then it's okay. The story says he offered her to stay if she found a job and helped, so maybe he had the right to end it if she didn't. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had conditions and the mother didn't meet them, so he's justified in asking her to leave.\n"
