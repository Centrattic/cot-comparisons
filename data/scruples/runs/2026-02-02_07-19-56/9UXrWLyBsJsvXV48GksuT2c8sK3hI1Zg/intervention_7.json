We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their son's mom out. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the ex-wife moved in after her own housing issues, agreed to help around the house and find a job. The author offered her a place partly to help her and partly to see their son more. The key points here are the agreement's terms and whether the ex-wife is fulfilling her part. \n\nThe ex-wife took a month and a half to find a job, which is a bit slow. Also, her behavior like partying, going to festivals, and staying at a boyfriend's house might be seen as irresponsible. But the author is upset and feels jealous because he can't do those things. That's a valid emotion, but does that justify wanting her out?\n\nThen, when the author confronts her about these issues, she attacks him, calling him a deadbeat and lying. That's a problem. The author is trying to communicate concerns, but she's defensive and aggressive. That dynamic could be toxic.\n\nBut the author also let her stay under certain conditions. If she's not meeting them, maybe he has grounds to ask her to leave. However, he's worried about legal repercussions regarding child custody. The time-sharing agreement hasn't changed, so the son's custody might not be affected by her moving out, unless she tries to use that against him legally.\n\nThe author's motivations are mixed. He helped her to see his son more, which is understandable. But now he's frustrated and wants her out. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to end the arrangement. \n\nOn one hand, he provided a place to stay and support, expecting her to contribute. If she's not meeting those terms, he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, his reasons for initial support were partly selfish, and he might be projecting his own frustrations onto her. However, he's also dealing with the ex-wife's disrespectful behavior.\n\nI need to consider if the author is violating any legal or moral obligations. Since they had an informal agreement, he can probably end it unless there's a legal contract. Legally, it's not clear, but morally, if she's not meeting the terms, he might be justified. However, his jealousy and frustration might cloud his judgment. Still, the main issue is her not fulfilling her part of the deal. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
