We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The poster is a father who allowed the mother of his son to stay in his house under certain conditions. He wants to kick her out because she's not meeting those expectations, like finding a job and maintaining the home, and she's been disrespectful. But he's also concerned about legal repercussions regarding custody and visitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since they have a time-sharing agreement, he can't just kick her out if she's part of that arrangement. The mother has rights, and any action he takes might affect his custody or visitation rights. Maybe he didn't properly document the agreement when she moved in, which could complicate things if it goes to court.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. He offered her a place to stay with the understanding that she'd help out and find a job. She accepted but hasn't met those terms. However, he also admitted part of his motivation was to see his son more. That might affect how sympathetic he's perceived. He's frustrated with her behavior and the disrespect, but reacting by kicking her out could be seen as retaliatory. The mother's response was defensive and insulting, which adds to the tension.\n\nHe's worried she'll retaliate by blocking his access to their son. That's a real concern because in custody disputes, any action that disrupts the child's stability can be problematic. He might be in a tough spot where his actions could be seen as not in the child's best interest, especially if the mother takes legal action.\n\nThe key points are the legal custody agreement, the terms he set for her staying, and the potential consequences of his actions. If he's not following the legal procedures or if the agreement isn't enforceable, he could be at fault. Also, his intent to retaliate might make him look worse if there's a conflict. On the other hand, if the mother is indeed violating the terms he set and being abusive, he might have a case, but it's complicated.\n\nSo, considering the legal and ethical aspects, he might be in the wrong because he's acting on personal frustration without considering the legal implications for custody and visitation. His initial offer to help her might not have been a formal agreement, so ending it unilaterally could backfire. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
