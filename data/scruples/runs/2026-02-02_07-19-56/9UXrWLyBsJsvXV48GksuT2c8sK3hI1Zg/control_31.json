We had a time sharing agreement and I had him on weekends. She wasn't working so I took more days during the week and paid for child care so she can go out and find a job and do other things with her life besides staying at home and smoking weed. Over the past couple years I've never missed a child support payment, I've worked full time, and I've got my kid as often as I can- i cover all his expense  \n\n\nAt the end of last year, she tells me she can't afford her rent anymore.(because she hasn't ever had a steady job). I offer to let her stay at my place if she helped out around the house, found a job, and promised to get back on her feet. I would cover rent and all living expenses and childcare. She accepts my offer. (Note, I didn't do this 100% to help her out... maybe 50%. I mainly wanted to see my son more often, so helping her was convenient ngl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks of her being here was not great. She threw all her stuff in my sons room, left a total mess for weeks. I bothered her so much about it, she finally cleaned it. To my perception, she dragged her ass getting a job. It took her a month and half to find one at a fast food place (she starts next week), she spent most of her time partying with her friends, going to festivals, staying at her boyfriends house, going on vacations etc. Most of this stuff makes me very upset because, to me, it does not seem like behaviour a mother should be exhibiting at this point in her life, but also jealous because with my schedule I don't have time to do any of that stuff. I'm working my ass off, with our same time sharing agreement before she moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I bring all this stuff up with her, I let her know that I don't feel like it's fair and I'm pretty upset about all of it. Then she rips into my life and calls me basically a deadbeat that's never been around. She insulted me for quite a long time, most of it out-of-touch lies. fake news. but it still hurt me a lot because I feel like ive sacrificed a lot for both her and my son. This isn't the first time she's acted like this with me, basically whenever I try to bring up something that is bothering me she switches to full attack mode. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to kick her out, because she's been so disrespectful with me, but I also feel bad because I told her she could stay here for six months. I'm also afraid that if I retaliate, she'll try to keep me from my son. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a post-divorce arrangement where the father allows the mother to live with him to have more time with his son. The mother is supposed to help around the house, find a job, and get back on her feet. However, she's not following through, partying, and being disrespectful when confronted.\n\nFirst, the father offered her a place to stay with specific conditions. She agreed. If she's not meeting those terms, he has a right to be upset. But he's also not the legal guardian anymore. The time-sharing agreement might be in place, so removing her could complicate his access to the child.\n\nHe mentions she's disrespectful and lies. That's a problem. But he also admits part of his motivation was to see his son more. Maybe his expectations were mixed. If he didn't formalize the living arrangement, it's hard to enforce. Also, if he kicks her out, she might use that as a reason to restrict his visitation. Custody issues can be legally tricky. The mother's behavior isn't good, but the father's actions could have consequences. So, he's not entirely in the wrong, but needs to consider legal implications. Maybe he's not AITA, but he should be cautious.\n"
