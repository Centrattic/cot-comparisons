      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author says they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned that even if the person was married, they wouldn't like it. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends were judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing their personal boundaries about their partner interacting with someone else of the opposite gender alone. This is a common issue in relationships where trust and comfort levels vary. The key points here are the author's personal beliefs versus societal norms or their friends' opinions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate if the author's stance is unreasonable. In many relationships, partners have different comfort levels regarding how their significant other interacts with others. The author's wife agrees with the same stance if the roles were reversed, which might indicate mutual agreement. However, friends disapproving suggests that the author's view might be seen as outdated or overprotective by others.\n\nI should also consider cultural and social norms. Some people believe that as long as there's no inappropriate behavior, friends of the opposite gender are fine. Others might have stricter boundaries. The author's position isn't necessarily illegal or harmful, but it's a personal preference. The question is whether being uncomfortable with such interactions makes someone the \"asshole.\" \n\nSince the author and their wife are on the same page, the disagreement is with friends. Friends not liking the author's opinion doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. However, if the author is imposing these views on others or making their partner feel restricted without mutual agreement, that could be problematic. But in this case, the wife agrees, so it's a mutual decision. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal boundaries in a relationship are valid. The author isn't doing anything wrong, but they might be seen as conservative. However, as long as both partners agree, it's their choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
