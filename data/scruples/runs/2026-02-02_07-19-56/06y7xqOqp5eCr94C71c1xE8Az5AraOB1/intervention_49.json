      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expressing that they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out alone with a single guy, even if the guy is married. The friends are upset, but the wife agrees if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance is about relationships and boundaries. They believe that being in a relationship means you shouldn't have one-on-one meetings with someone of the opposite gender who isn't in a relationship. The wife agrees, so there's mutual understanding in their relationship. But the friends are against this view, which is why the author is seeking judgment.\n\nOn one hand, the author's viewpoint could be seen as traditional or old-fashioned. Many modern relationships emphasize trust and open communication rather than strict boundaries about social interactions. If both partners agree on the boundaries, that's their choice. However, some might argue that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting their partner, which could be a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't necessarily enforcing this on their wife; they're sharing their own feelings. If the wife agrees, then their mutual understanding is valid. The issue here is whether it's acceptable for someone to have such preferences without being accused of being an asshole. The friends' reaction might be based on their own views on relationships and freedom, but the author isn't harming anyone by expressing their opinion unless it's imposing on others.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement between the couple, the author isn't forcing their wife to follow these rules, and the friends are just upset about the opinion. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for having their own beliefs as long as they respect their partner's autonomy. The friends might not agree, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
