      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one and they also wouldn't like it if he was married. The wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but the friends are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider perspectives. The author's stance is based on their own comfort as a partner. They might believe that such interactions could lead to problems or that it's inappropriate because one is in a relationship. But the friends disapprove, thinking maybe it's too controlling or not necessary. \n\nI should think about whether personal boundaries are valid. It's common for people in relationships to have certain boundaries to protect their relationship. But where's the line? If the wife agrees and both are comfortable, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, some might argue that it's not the partner's place to dictate how others interact, unless there's an explicit agreement. \n\nAlso, cultural and societal norms vary. In some cultures, close friendships across genders are normal, while in others, they might be viewed with suspicion. The author's friends might come from a more open perspective where such interactions are fine. \n\nThe author's reasoning could be seen as jealousy or insecurity, but if both partners agree, it's their choice. The friends might be reacting because they see it as unnecessary control. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author and their wife are on the same page, maybe the author isn't wrong, but their friends' judgment is just a difference in opinion. \n\nSo, the answer probably depends on whether the boundaries are mutual and agreed upon. Since the wife agrees with the same boundaries, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The friends' disapproval doesn't make the author wrong; it's their own relationship's dynamic. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
