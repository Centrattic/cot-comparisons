      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author stated they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one. They also mention that if the guy was married, they still wouldn't like it. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. However, their friends reacted negatively.\n\nI should consider cultural and personal values here. Some people might see this as a personal choice, especially if both partners agree. On the other hand, others might view it as controlling or distrustful. The key points are consent and mutual agreement. Since the author and their wife agree, it's a mutual decision. However, the friends' disapproval suggests that societal norms vary. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on context. If the author is being respectful of their wife's feelings and their boundaries are mutual, then it's their choice. However, if they're imposing restrictions without consent, that's different. Here, the wife agrees, so it's consensual. \n\nBut some might argue that even mutual boundaries can be problematic if they're based on insecurity or traditional views. The author's reasoning might be seen as outdated by some, leading friends to disapprove. However, the AITA format usually focuses on whether the action was wrong, not just if others disagree. Since there's no evidence of harm or coercion, and it's a mutual agreement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (No).\n"
