      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThe author says they're not okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. They also mention they wouldn't like it if she met someone who's married too. Their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing a personal boundary about their partner's interactions with others. It's about their own comfort in the relationship. The wife shares similar feelings, so it's a mutual agreement. But friends are upset by this stance.\n\nIn relationships, people have different boundaries. What's important is that both partners agree on these boundaries. Since the wife agrees, it's a mutual decision. The friends' reactions might be based on their own views, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. Jealousy or insecurity can play a role here. The author isn't doing anything harmful as long as their partner consents and they both are on the same page. The key here is mutual consent and agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries that both they and their partner agree with. Friends disapproving doesn't equate to being wrong in the situation. The answer should be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
