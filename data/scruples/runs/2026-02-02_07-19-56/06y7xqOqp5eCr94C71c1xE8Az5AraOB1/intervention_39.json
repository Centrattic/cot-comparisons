      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author said they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned that their wife agrees, but their friends reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. From the author's viewpoint, they're expressing a personal boundary. Maybe they feel uncomfortable with their partner being alone with someone else, even if that person is single. It's their personal comfort and maybe a cultural or traditional belief. They're not necessarily saying it's illegal or harmful, just that they don't think it's appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, many people advocate for individual freedom and trust in relationships. Friends might argue that as long as the boundaries are mutual and no one is cheating or leading on, it's none of their business. They could see the author's stance as controlling or based on outdated norms. The fact that the wife agrees adds a layer\u2014maybe it's their mutual agreement, which others might respect, but the friends still disapprove.\n\nI should also think about whether the author is imposing their views on others. If the author is in a relationship where both agree, then it's their choice. But if they're trying to make a general rule for everyone, that could be problematic. The key here is that the author is stating their opinion, not necessarily enforcing it on others. However, friends might feel that by expressing this, the author is being judgmental or not respecting others' autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, trust is important. The author's discomfort might stem from a lack of trust, which could be a red flag. But if both partners are comfortable with their own boundaries, maybe it's okay. The friends' reaction is about social norms versus personal choice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, it's subjective. They're not breaking any laws or harming anyone, just expressing a personal belief. However, in modern contexts, some might see this as restrictive. The answer depends on whether personal choice trumps personal discomfort. Since the author is not forcing anyone but stating their own view, maybe it's not their fault. But others might argue that promoting such views can contribute to controlling behaviors. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh these factors. The question is whether the author is wrong in their opinion. Since it's a personal boundary and they're not harming others, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the friends are objecting because it's seen as judgmental or controlling, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but the question forces a choice. Since the author is not acting on their opinion but just expressing it, and their wife agrees, it's their personal choice. However, friends might still disagree. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's their opinion and they have mutual agreement. So answer B.\n"
