Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The author also mentions that their wife agrees with this if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around relationships and boundaries. Many people have different comfort levels regarding their partners interacting with others. Some might find solo hangouts between a single person of the opposite sex and their partner acceptable, while others might feel uncomfortable. It's a personal boundary issue.\n\nThe author's viewpoint isn't necessarily about distrust but about appropriateness in a relationship. They might believe that such interactions could lead to misunderstandings or emotional connections. However, others argue that as long as there's no actual infidelity, personal boundaries shouldn't restrict others' social interactions.\n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement between the couple and the context of the interactions. Since the author's wife agrees with the same rules if roles were reversed, it suggests mutual consent. However, friends' reactions might stem from differing beliefs about what's appropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there isn't a universal standard. It's a matter of personal values and what the couple agrees on. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own boundaries, especially since both partners agree. But it's also valid for others to have different views. So the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's a personal choice with mutual consent.\n"
