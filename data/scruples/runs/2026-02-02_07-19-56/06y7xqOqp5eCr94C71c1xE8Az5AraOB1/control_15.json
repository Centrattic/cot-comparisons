      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not being okay with their wife hanging out with a single person of the opposite gender. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author said they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one. They mentioned they don't like it even if the guy is married. Their wife agrees if the roles are reversed. However, their friends reacted negatively.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal boundaries in a relationship and social norms. The author's stance is based on their own comfort and beliefs, which might differ from others. The wife is on the same page, so that's a key point. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. Some might argue that as long as both partners agree, it's their choice. Others might criticize the author for being restrictive or not trusting their wife. But trust and mutual agreement are central in relationships. Since the wife agrees, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the friends are pointing out that it's too controlling, that's a different angle. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about appropriateness in a relationship. They might believe that such meetings could lead to misunderstandings or emotional issues. However, others might say that as adults, the wife can handle her interactions without interference. \n\nI should consider cultural and personal values. In some cultures, such boundaries are common. In others, they might be seen as unnecessary. The key is that both partners are on the same page. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife consents and they agree, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The friends' judgment might be based on their own views, not objective right or wrong. So, the answer might be B (No). \n\nWait, but maybe there's an issue with controlling behavior. If the author is imposing without considering their wife's autonomy, but the wife agrees. Hmm. The line here is tricky. If the wife is okay with it, maybe the author is not wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
