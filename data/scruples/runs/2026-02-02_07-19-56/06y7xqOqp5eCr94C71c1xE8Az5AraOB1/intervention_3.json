      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expressing their view about someone in a relationship hanging out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one and even mentions they wouldn't like it if he was married. They note that their wife agrees if roles were reversed, but their friends criticized them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is making a statement about their personal boundaries in a relationship. They\u2019re not necessarily saying it's wrong for others to have such boundaries, but they\u2019re expressing their own discomfort. The friends' reaction is negative, which makes the author question their stance.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many couples do have varying comfort levels regarding interactions with others of the opposite gender. Some might see one-on-one meetings as a potential issue, especially if it's a close friend or ex, while others don't. The author isn't advocating for others to share their views, just stating their own. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether the author is wrong for having this opinion. The question isn't about whether their opinion is right or wrong in a moral sense but whether they're in the wrong for expressing it. Since personal boundaries vary, the author is not in the wrong for having their own stance. They\u2019re not imposing it on others, just sharing their feelings. The friends' judgment doesn't make the author wrong; it just means there's a difference in perspectives.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. The author mentions they wouldn't be okay even if the other person was married. That might imply a lack of consideration for the married person's situation, but the main point is about their own approval of their spouse's actions. The author is stating their personal preference, not making a judgment about others' relationships. \n\nIn relationships, communication about boundaries is important. Since the author's wife agrees with the mutual boundaries, that's a positive aspect. The friends' disapproval doesn't negate the author's right to hold their views. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their personal boundaries, even if others disagree.\n"
