      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author says they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned their friends disapproved, but their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and individual perspectives. Some people believe that even in a relationship, meeting someone of the opposite gender alone isn't inherently wrong, especially if there's no romantic intent. But others might see it as a potential issue, depending on the relationship's dynamics and trust levels.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's inappropriate, and they're okay with married people meeting singles alone. However, their friends disapprove, which is why they're seeking judgment. The key points here are the boundaries they set and the reactions from friends and their spouse.\n\nIn relationship advice, it's often emphasized that communication between partners about comfort levels is crucial. If both parties agree on certain boundaries, like not meeting others of the opposite gender alone, that's their mutual agreement. The author's wife agrees with the same rule when roles are reversed, so that's a point in their favor.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as long as there's no infidelity or deceit, meeting someone of the opposite gender alone isn't inherently wrong. The author's friends' disapproval could stem from differing views on personal freedom versus relationship boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have their partner's agreement and set boundaries they're comfortable with. It's a matter of personal choice and mutual consent between partners.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their stance is based on mutual agreement with their spouse, even though others might have different opinions.\n"
