      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking it's inappropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a guy alone, and they also don't like if he's married. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about social norms and personal boundaries in relationships. The author's stance is based on their own comfort level. They aren't saying it's against the law or anything, just their personal opinion. Their friends' reaction is negative, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. Everyone has different views on what's appropriate. The fact that their wife agrees in reverse roles suggests mutual understanding in their relationship. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a problem if this view leads to controlling behavior. If it's just a personal preference and not enforced as a rule, maybe it's okay. However, some people might argue that trusting your partner and allowing them independence is important. But the author isn't enforcing it; they're just stating their feelings. Friends disapproving could be because they see it as prudish or unnecessary. \n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't harming anyone, just expressing their opinion. Since they're in a relationship where both agree, it's their choice. The friends' judgment isn't a valid reason to say the author is wrong. So the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
