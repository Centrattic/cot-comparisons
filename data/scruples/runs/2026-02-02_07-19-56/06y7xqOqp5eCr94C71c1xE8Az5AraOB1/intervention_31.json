      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is wrong for thinking that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentions they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one and their friends disapprove.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal boundaries. In many relationships, trust and communication are key. The author's stance might stem from a place of wanting to avoid potential jealousy or misunderstandings. However, others might argue that as long as both partners are comfortable and there's no deceit, such interactions are normal and shouldn't be restricted. The author's wife agrees with the sentiment, which might reinforce their view, but friends seeing it as a problem suggests differing opinions.\n\nIt's important to note that relationship dynamics vary. What's acceptable in one relationship might not be in another. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having this belief, especially if it's a mutual agreement with their spouse. However, the friends' reaction highlights that not everyone shares this view. The author's perspective isn't inherently wrong, but it's also not universally right. The answer likely hinges on whether personal boundaries, mutual agreement, and lack of harm make the author's stance valid. Since there's no deceit or harm mentioned, and it's a personal choice between partners, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
