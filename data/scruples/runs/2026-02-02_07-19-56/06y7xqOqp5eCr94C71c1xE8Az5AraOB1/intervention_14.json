      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing discomfort about their spouse meeting someone of the opposite gender alone. The author mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, and their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of jealousy in relationships. It's common for people to feel uneasy about their partner spending time with someone else, especially if it's one-on-one. The author's stance might stem from a place of wanting to avoid any potential issues or misunderstandings. However, societal norms around relationships have evolved. Many people believe that as long as both partners are comfortable and there's no infidelity, meeting friends of the opposite sex is acceptable. \n\nThe author's wife agrees with the roles reversed, which suggests mutual understanding and agreement. That's a good point because it shows they're on the same page. But the friends' reaction indicates that some might view this as unnecessary or overly controlling. The key here is whether the author's stance is based on trust and communication or on possessiveness. If the author and their spouse have a mutual agreement and are both comfortable, then it's their choice. However, if the author is imposing this without the spouse's consent, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of autonomy in relationships. Partners should have the freedom to socialize unless there's a specific agreement against it. The author's discomfort might be personal, but it shouldn't infringe on their spouse's rights unless there's a mutual understanding. The friends' disapproval might be because they see this as restrictive, but it's also valid to have boundaries if both partners agree.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. In some cultures, meeting someone of the opposite gender alone might be frowned upon, while in others, it's perfectly acceptable. The author might be coming from a more conservative background. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just the cultural perspective. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author's stance is based on trust and mutual agreement, then it's not inherently wrong. But if it's based on insecurity or controlling behavior, that's a different matter. The fact that the author's wife agrees with the roles reversed suggests that there's mutual consent here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position isn't necessarily wrong if both partners are in agreement. However, the friends' disapproval might stem from a different perspective. The key factor is mutual agreement. If both the author and their spouse are okay with these boundaries, then it's their choice. The author isn't in the wrong for having those beliefs as long as they respect each other's autonomy and there's no coercion involved. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
