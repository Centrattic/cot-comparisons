I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing discomfort about their spouse hanging out alone with someone of the opposite gender who is single. The author's stance is that it's inappropriate for someone in a relationship to be alone with a single person of the opposite gender. Their wife agrees if roles were reversed, but their friends disapprove.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is sharing a personal opinion about boundaries in relationships. It's important to note that relationships and boundaries vary widely. What's acceptable in one relationship might not be in another. The author isn't making a claim about others' relationships but stating their own preferences. \n\nThe friends' reaction is based on their own views, perhaps perceiving the author's stance as judgmental or old-fashioned. However, the author isn't imposing their views on others; they're just expressing their personal feelings about their own relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for having these feelings. Personal preferences about relationship boundaries aren't inherently right or wrong. The author's stance isn't harmful unless it's enforced on others. Since they're only talking about their own relationship and their partner is in agreement, the author isn't violating any social norms or rights. \n\nAdditionally, societal norms around relationships have evolved, and some might view strict boundaries as unnecessary. However, individual relationships are private matters. The author isn't making a universal statement but sharing their personal comfort level. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their opinion, even if others disagree. The friends might have different views, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The main point is the author's own relationship dynamics, which are consensual between them and their spouse.\n"
