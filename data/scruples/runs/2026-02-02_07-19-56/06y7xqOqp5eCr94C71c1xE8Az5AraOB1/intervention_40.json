      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship and expressed their discomfort about their partner meeting someone else alone, regardless of the other person's relationship status. They mention their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm, relationships can vary a lot in terms of what's acceptable. Some people might feel jealous or insecure about their partner spending time with someone else, especially one-on-one. Others might see it as normal, as long as there's trust and no actual issues. The author's stance is based on their personal feelings, which is understandable. However, the friends' reaction suggests that some people view this as being controlling or lacking trust.\n\nI should consider cultural and personal norms here. In some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on monogamous relationships where any one-on-one time with someone else might be frowned upon. In others, it's seen as harmless unless there's a reason to be suspicious. The author's wife agrees with the same standard, so maybe they have mutual expectations. But the friends' disapproval might stem from a more open or trusting viewpoint where such interactions are normal.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the author and their wife are on the same page, maybe the issue isn't with the author's stance but with how they communicated it. If they set boundaries upfront and their wife is okay with it, then it's their choice. But if the author's reaction stems from jealousy without trust issues, that's different.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author mentions they would also disapprove if the person was married might indicate a general discomfort with opposite-sex interactions, which could signal a lack of trust. However, if they and their partner mutually agree on boundaries, that's their prerogative.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But many people might argue that unless there's infidelity or clear harm, wanting to control social interactions can be seen as controlling. However, if both partners agree, it's their choice. The friends' judgment isn't necessarily right either, but the question is about the author's position.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries in their relationship, especially if mutual. But others might see it as controlling. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's about personal boundaries within a consensual relationship.\n"
