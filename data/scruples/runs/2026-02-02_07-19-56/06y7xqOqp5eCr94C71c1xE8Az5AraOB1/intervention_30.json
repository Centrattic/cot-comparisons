I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship and shares their opinion that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out alone with someone of the opposite gender who's single. They mentioned their wife agrees if roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries in relationships. The author is expressing their own comfort level. The question is whether that stance is wrong. Opinions on this can vary. Some people believe that in a trusting relationship, such boundaries aren't necessary unless there's a specific reason. Others think it's about personal comfort and mutual agreement.\n\nSince the author and their spouse agree on this, it's their choice. The friends' disapproval might stem from different views on trust and autonomy. There's no universal right or wrong here; it's a matter of personal belief and what the couple is comfortable with. The author isn't harming anyone, just expressing their preference. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
