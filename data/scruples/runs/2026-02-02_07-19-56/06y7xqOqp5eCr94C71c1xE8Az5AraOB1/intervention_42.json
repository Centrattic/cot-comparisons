I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's friends disapproved, but their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. I need to decide if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, personal boundaries in relationships vary. Some people are uncomfortable with their partner spending time alone with someone of the opposite gender, even if they're single. It's about trust and what each couple agrees on. The author and their wife are on the same page, which is important. But friends might see it as controlling or unnecessary. However, the author isn't doing anything harmful; they're just expressing their feelings. So, it's a matter of differing opinions. Since the couple agrees, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue it's restrictive. Hmm, I think the answer hinges on whether the feelings are mutual and respectful. Since the wife agrees, it's their choice. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
