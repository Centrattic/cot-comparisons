      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author said they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender, and they also mentioned they wouldn't like it if she met someone who's married. Their friends disapproved, but their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms here. In some cultures, people in relationships might have strict boundaries about their partners interacting with others of the opposite gender, especially one-on-one. However, in more modern or liberal societies, this might be seen as controlling or unnecessary. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's inappropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the other gender. But wait, the person they're talking about is single. If the person is single, then the interaction isn't with someone who's in a relationship, so maybe the author is projecting their own insecurities. Also, the author's wife is okay with the reverse, but the author is imposing their own standards on her. That could be seen as unequal expectations.\n\nThe friends turning their noses up suggests that the author's view isn't the majority opinion. If the author is comfortable with their wife's perspective, but they're enforcing their own rules without considering her autonomy, that's a problem. Trust and communication are key in relationships. If the author is uncomfortable, they should discuss it with their wife rather than dictate her actions based on their own preferences.\n\nAnother angle: is the author being hypocritical? The author is in a relationship, so why should their wife have different rules? But the key point is that the other person is single, which might not be a valid reason for the author's disapproval. The author's stance might stem from jealousy rather than a mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their wife agrees with the same standards if roles were reversed. That's good, but it doesn't necessarily justify the author's stance. The fact that they both agree on mutual exclusivity is a positive, but the author's issue with a single person might be an overreach. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on context. If the author is being controlling or not trusting their wife, then yes. If they're setting boundaries based on mutual agreement and the wife is comfortable with those boundaries, then maybe not. But since the friends are disapproving, and the author's reasoning might be based on personal insecurity rather than a genuine need for trust, it's leaning towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They might be imposing their own insecurities on their wife without valid reasons, especially when the other person is single. Healthy relationships should have trust, and controlling behavior can erode that.\n"
