      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for disapproving of their spouse hanging out one-on-one with someone of the opposite gender, especially a single person. The author's wife agrees with this, but their friends are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, there's a traditional view that a spouse shouldn't be alone with someone of the opposite gender. The author is expressing their personal boundaries, which might be part of their relationship dynamics. However, modern perspectives often emphasize trust and independence in relationships. Friends might see this as controlling or outdated.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. Since the author's wife agrees with this boundary, it's a mutual decision between them. That's important because it's their relationship's rules. But friends might argue that it's unnecessary to restrict someone's social interactions unless there's a specific reason. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not liking it if the person was married either. That part might be more about jealousy or traditional views. If both partners agree on the boundaries, it's their choice. But friends might see it as restrictive. \n\nI need to decide if it's wrong. The answer depends on whether the author is respecting their spouse's autonomy and if it's causing harm. Since it's mutual and not harmful, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the friends' judgment is about personal freedom, which is a common point of contention. So the answer would be B (No), because it's a personal choice they've both agreed on.\n"
