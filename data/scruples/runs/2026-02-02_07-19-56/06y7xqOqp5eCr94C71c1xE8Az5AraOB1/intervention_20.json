      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing discomfort about their spouse spending time alone with a single person of the opposite sex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is in a relationship, and they stated they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, even if the guy is married. Their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed. But their friends reacted negatively.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I should consider different perspectives here. On one hand, relationships and trust are key. If both partners agree on boundaries and they're comfortable with each other, that's their choice. But if the author's stance is based on controlling behavior or lack of trust, that could be problematic. However, the author mentions it's not a serious matter and their wife agrees. So maybe it's more about personal preference rather than a controlling attitude.\n\nBut the friends disapprove, so maybe the author is being too restrictive. In many modern relationships, it's considered okay for partners to have individual friendships, especially if they're in a healthy, trusting relationship. The author's view might be seen as outdated or overly possessive. \n\nHowever, there's no absolute right or wrong here. It's more about personal and cultural norms. The key is whether the author's stance is causing harm or conflict in their relationship. Since they mention their wife agrees, it might not be an issue for them. But if the author is imposing their views without considering their partner's autonomy, that could be a problem. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they and their spouse are on the same page. But if they're enforcing this without mutual agreement or causing unnecessary jealousy, then maybe they are. The question is a bit ambiguous, but given the context that the wife agrees, maybe the author is not in the wrong. However, some might argue that such views can lead to controlling behavior. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. If the author is honest with their spouse and they both agree, then it's their choice. But the friends' reaction suggests it's a common point of contention. Still, the answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship. Since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is A or B. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
