I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy of the opposite gender, and they also mention they wouldn't like it if the guy was married. The friends disapproved, so the author wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance is about their personal boundaries in a relationship. They're sharing their own feelings, which they believe are valid. However, some might argue that this is a form of controlling behavior or jealousy, even if it's based on their own values.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author mentions their wife agrees with the reverse scenario, which suggests mutual understanding. That's a good point. But the friends' reaction could be because they see it as unnecessary restriction or judgment. \n\nIt's also important to note that what's acceptable varies culturally and individually. The author isn't harming anyone by stating their preferences, but imposing such views on others might not be appropriate. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong themselves, not the friends.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by expressing their opinion. They're setting boundaries for their own relationship, which is their right. The friends disapproving might be due to differing values, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Unless the author is being abusive, which there's no indication of here, their stance is personal and not inherently wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong; they're expressing their personal boundaries, which is valid as long as both partners agree.\n"
