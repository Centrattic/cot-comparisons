      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expressing discomfort with their spouse hanging out 1-on-1 with someone of the opposite gender who is single. They mention that even if the other person was married, they still wouldn't like it. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends are judgmental.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's main point is about their personal boundaries in a relationship. They're not saying their wife can't hang out with anyone, but specifically with single guys. They might be coming from a place of jealousy or wanting to set clear boundaries to prevent any potential issues. The wife agrees with the roles reversed, so maybe they have mutual understanding here.\n\nBut the friends are upset. Why? Well, some people might think that as long as there's no infidelity or explicit rule against it, a spouse can hang out with others. The author's stance could be seen as controlling or unnecessary, depending on the context. However, relationships are personal, and boundaries can vary. If both partners agree on these boundaries, that's their choice. The friends' judgment might be based on their own opinions, not necessarily right or wrong.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Legally, no. Morally or socially? It's more subjective. Some might argue that trusting your partner is important, and setting such boundaries could lead to distrust. Others might support the author for setting clear expectations. Since the wife agrees, it's a mutual decision. The friends' disapproval doesn't make the author wrong if both parties are okay with it. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
