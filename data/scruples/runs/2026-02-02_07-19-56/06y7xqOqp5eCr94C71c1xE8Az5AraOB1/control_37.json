      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author made this comment during a conversation with friends. They mentioned that they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, and even if the guy was married. The wife agrees with this sentiment if roles were reversed. However, the friends reacted negatively. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries. In relationships, it's common for partners to have preferences about how their significant other interacts with others. Some people might be more open, while others prefer stricter boundaries. The key here is that the author's stance is about their own relationship dynamics. Unless there's a specific rule or agreement that the author violated, expressing personal boundaries shouldn't be wrong. \n\nThe friends disapproving could be due to differing views on relationships. Some people might see one-on-one meetings between a person in a relationship and someone of the opposite gender as harmless, while others might see it as a potential issue. The author isn't forcing anyone; they're stating their own feelings. Their wife also agrees, which means there's mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the friends were in a position where they were judging based on their own beliefs, that's their perspective. But unless the author did something harmful or violated an agreement, their opinion is just that\u2014personal. It's about personal boundaries, not right or wrong in a universal sense.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing their own relationship boundaries, which are valid as long as both partners agree. The friends' disapproval doesn't make the author at fault here.\n"
