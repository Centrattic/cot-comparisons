      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author is male, and he said he wouldn't be okay with his wife meeting a single guy one-on-one. He also mentioned he wouldn't like it if the guy was married either. His friends disapprove, and he's seeking judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine whether his opinion is considered wrong. Opinions on relationships can vary a lot. The key here is whether his stance is a personal boundary or if it's an unreasonable restriction. \n\nIn many modern contexts, people value autonomy and trust in relationships. Friends might think that as long as there's no infidelity, hanging out with someone else isn't a problem. However, the author's perspective could stem from personal discomfort or jealousy, which is his prerogative. The fact that his wife agrees if the roles were reversed suggests mutual understanding, which might be acceptable.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's expressing his personal boundaries and his wife is okay with it, then he's not wrong in expressing those feelings. However, if he's enforcing this as a rule without mutual agreement, that could be an issue. But the scenario says his wife agrees, so it's mutual. \n\nSo the answer might be B, not in the wrong, since it's a personal boundary and he's upfront about it. Friends disapproving doesn't make it wrong; it's a difference in values. Unless there's a lack of communication or trust, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
