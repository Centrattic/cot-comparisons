      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their spouse spending one-on-one time with someone of the opposite gender who is single. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal boundaries. The author's perspective is based on their own discomfort, which they feel is valid. However, friends might see this as possessive or controlling. The key here is whether the author's stance is unreasonable.\n\nIn many modern relationships, personal boundaries can vary. Some people are okay with spouses spending time with others of the opposite gender, while others aren't. The author's wife agrees with the mutual exclusivity, which is a positive sign of shared values. But friends reacting negatively might indicate differing views on what's acceptable.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's stance is harmful or infringes on others' rights. The author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical. They're expressing their personal boundaries, which they've communicated to their spouse. If the spouse is okay with it and they're both on the same page, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the friends feel judged or think it's controlling, that's a different angle.\n\nBut the author isn't acting on it\u2014just expressing a preference. The friends are disapproving of the opinion, not any action. So the author isn't in the wrong for having that opinion, as long as it's mutual and doesn't force others to comply. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But some might argue that it's outdated or restrictive. However, as long as it's mutual consent, it's a matter of personal choice.\n"
