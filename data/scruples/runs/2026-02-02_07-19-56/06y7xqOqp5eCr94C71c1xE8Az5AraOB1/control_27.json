      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, even if he's married. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. But their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Opinions on relationships and boundaries vary. The author is expressing their personal feelings, which is valid. They're not forcing anyone to follow their views, just stating what they're uncomfortable with. Their wife shares the same opinion, so there's mutual agreement there. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in modern relationships, such restrictions could be seen as controlling or based on outdated gender norms. But the author isn't imposing these on others; they're just sharing their own stance. The friends' disapproval might stem from different values, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't acting on these beliefs in a harmful way. They're not confronting others or causing conflict. Their statement is about personal boundaries within their own relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their views are their own, and as long as they don't infringe on others' rights or cause harm, it's their prerogative. Different people have different comfort levels, and that's okay as long as it's consensual within their relationship.\n"
