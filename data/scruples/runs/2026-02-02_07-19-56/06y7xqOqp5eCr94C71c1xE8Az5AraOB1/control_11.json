      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author stating that they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, and even if the guy was married. The wife agrees with this sentiment, but the friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down. \n\nThe author's stance is about their personal boundary regarding their spouse interacting one-on-one with someone of the opposite gender who is single. They mention that their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. So, there's mutual consent in the relationship here. The friends are upset, but the key question is whether the author's opinion is objectively wrong, not whether it's socially acceptable.\n\nIn terms of morality, personal boundaries in relationships can vary. Some people might find it okay for a married person to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender, while others might not. The author is expressing their discomfort, which isn't inherently wrong. Unless the author's statement is based on something like racism, sexism, or another harmful bias, it's more about personal preference. \n\nThe author isn't making their wife do anything; they're just sharing their own feelings. The friends' disapproval might stem from a different perspective, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Relationships often involve mutual agreements on such matters. Since the wife agrees, there's no coercion here. \n\nHowever, if the author's stance is restrictive without valid reasons or if it's causing harm, that could tip the scale. But the scenario doesn't mention any harm beyond the friends' disapproval. The author's concern is about appropriateness, which is subjective. \n\nSo, unless there's a specific wrong action (like restricting someone's freedom without cause), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting personal boundaries within their relationship, which is their right. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
