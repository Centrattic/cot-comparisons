      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's wife agrees with this sentiment if roles were reversed. The friends disliked this stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's appropriate in relationships. In many relationships, boundaries about interactions with others can vary. Some partners might prefer their significant other not to be alone with someone of the opposite sex, especially if it's a close friend or someone they're not comfortable with. Others might see it as a personal choice and not something to judge.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author's opinion is based on their own comfort level, and their wife agrees. So there's mutual consent in their relationship.\n2. The friends disapproved, which is subjective. Just because others don't agree doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n3. The author isn't forcing their wife to follow this; they're sharing their personal boundary.\n\nHowever, promoting such views publicly might lead others to question the necessity of these boundaries, especially in cases where it's not about infidelity or trust issues. It's important that relationships respect each other's boundaries, but imposing one's beliefs on others or making others feel judged could be problematic.\n\nIn this case, the author isn't acting out of malice but personal preference, and since their wife is on board, it's their relationship's dynamic. The friends' reaction is about differing opinions, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
