I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for stating that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out alone with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentions they would be uncomfortable with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, even though their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. Their friends disapproved, and now they want to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. From a personal values standpoint, some people believe that in a relationship, there should be boundaries to prevent potential jealousy or insecurity. The author's stance might be rooted in wanting to avoid situations that could lead to misunderstandings or emotional infidelity. However, others might argue that this is an overreach, promoting possessiveness or distrust. \n\nCultural and societal norms also play a role. In some cultures, close friendships between opposite genders are viewed as acceptable, while others see it as problematic. The key here is that the author's wife agrees with the mutual boundaries, which shows both are comfortable with this arrangement. That mutual agreement is important because relationships are between two people, and their comfort levels matter more than others' opinions.\n\nThe friends' reaction is another angle. They might see the author's view as outdated or controlling. But if both partners are on the same page and there's no harm involved, the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. It's about personal and relational boundaries rather than a universal right or wrong. \n\nHowever, there's a line between healthy boundaries and unnecessary restrictions. If the author is imposing these rules without considering their wife's autonomy or if it leads to resentment, that could be problematic. But since the wife agrees, it's more about their shared values. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the decision is mutual and based on their relationship dynamics. The friends' disapproval might stem from different beliefs, but the core issue is about personal choice in a consensual relationship. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
