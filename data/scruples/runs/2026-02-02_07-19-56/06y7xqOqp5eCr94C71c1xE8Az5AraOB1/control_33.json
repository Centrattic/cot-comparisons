      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender, even if that person is married. The friends reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is stating their personal boundaries in a relationship. It's their opinion that such interactions aren't appropriate. They also mention that their wife agrees with the sentiment if roles were reversed. \n\nNow, the question is whether this view makes the author wrong. There's a lot to consider here. Relationship norms vary widely. What's acceptable in one culture or relationship might not be in another. The author isn't making a moral judgment on others but stating their own stance. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being hypocritical because they also mention disliking if their wife met a married man. But the key point is that the author is sharing their personal feelings, not dictating others' actions. The friends' disapproval might stem from different views on personal autonomy and trust in relationships. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for expressing their discomfort? Probably not. People have different comfort levels, and as long as it's within a consensual relationship and the partner agrees, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. The friends' judgment doesn't necessarily validate or invalidate the author's perspective. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because personal boundaries in relationships are subjective and valid unless they harm others.\n"
