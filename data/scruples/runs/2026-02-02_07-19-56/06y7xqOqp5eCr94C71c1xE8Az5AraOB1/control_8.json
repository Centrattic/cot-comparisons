      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship and has expressed this opinion to friends. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but the friends are upset. The key points here are the author's personal boundaries versus others' reactions.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal norms. In many cultures, there's a common belief that in a relationship, each partner should avoid close, isolated interactions with the opposite sex to prevent jealousy or potential issues. So the author's stance isn't unheard of. However, others might view this as controlling or unnecessary, especially if both partners are comfortable with it.\n\nThe fact that the wife agrees if roles were reversed is important. It shows mutual understanding in their relationship, which is good. But friends disapproving might be because they see it as restrictive or not a big deal. The question is whether the author's opinion is wrong.\n\nI should think about whether this is about personal choice. The author is sharing their feelings, not forcing their wife. If the wife agrees, it's their relationship's dynamic. Friends might have different views, but that doesn't make the author wrong unless their stance is harmful. There's no indication of controlling behavior here, just a personal boundary.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. It's about personal and relational boundaries, which can vary. Unless the author is being abusive, their opinion, though not popular with some friends, isn't inherently wrong.\n"
