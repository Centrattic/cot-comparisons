      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their spouse hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender if they were in a relationship. Their friends reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, people have strong beliefs about boundaries in relationships, especially regarding interactions with the opposite sex. The author's view might stem from a place of wanting to avoid potential jealousy or misunderstandings. They also mention their spouse agrees if roles were reversed, which shows mutual understanding between them. That's a key point because mutual agreement can be important in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that such views can be restrictive and based on outdated gender norms. Modern perspectives often emphasize trust and open communication over strict rules. If the friends turned their noses up, maybe they value personal freedom and autonomy more, believing that as long as both partners are comfortable, it's acceptable. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily enforcing this on their spouse; they're sharing their opinion. However, the friends' reaction might be because they see this as a controlling attitude. But the author's stance is personal and not imposed unless their spouse disagrees. Since the spouse agrees, it's a mutual decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If they respect their spouse's autonomy and there's mutual agreement, then maybe not. But in a society that values individual choice, some might see their view as old-fashioned. However, there's no harm done here since it's their own relationship's boundary. The friends' judgment is subjective. The answer hinges on whether personal beliefs about relationships are considered wrong if they don't harm others. In this case, since the spouse agrees and it's their own choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
