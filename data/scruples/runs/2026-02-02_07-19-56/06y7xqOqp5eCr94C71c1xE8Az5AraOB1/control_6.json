      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their spouse hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned that even if the other person was married, they wouldn't be okay with it. Their wife agrees if roles were reversed, but their friends criticized them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author believes that in a committed relationship, their spouse shouldn't have one-on-one interactions with someone of the opposite gender, regardless of the other person's relationship status. Their wife is on board with this, so that's a mutual agreement. The friends, however, think this is unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people do hold the belief that in a relationship, their partner should limit certain interactions with others, especially if it's one-on-one. This can be seen as a matter of trust and boundaries. However, others argue that this is controlling or not based on trust, which is essential in a healthy relationship. The key here is that the author and their spouse are in agreement. Since both partners have the same expectations, it's a consensual arrangement. \n\nFriendship and social norms might differ. The friends who criticized the author might come from a more liberal viewpoint where individual autonomy is prioritized, and such restrictions are seen as unnecessary. But if the author and spouse are comfortable with their boundaries, then it's their choice as long as it's mutual and not causing harm.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is consensual and both parties agree, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that even with mutual agreement, such restrictions could lead to insecurity or control. But since the scenario states that the wife agrees, it's more about differing opinions rather than wrongdoing. \n\nThe answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the boundaries are mutual and agreed upon by both partners. The friends' disapproval doesn't make the author wrong; it's more about differing values. The key here is mutual consent and agreement in the relationship. So, the answer is B.\n"
