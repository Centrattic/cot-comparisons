      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author states they're uncomfortable with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy of the opposite gender and even a married one. Their friends disapproved, so they're seeking judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's viewpoint is about what's appropriate in a relationship. They believe that a partner in a relationship shouldn't have one-on-one meetings with someone of the opposite gender, regardless of the other person's relationship status. Their wife agrees with the same stance if the roles were reversed. The friends, however, think this is too restrictive.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries can vary. Some couples are comfortable with partners meeting others one-on-one, while others prefer more restrictions. The key here is whether the author's stance is inherently wrong. The author isn't making a demand but expressing their personal opinion. However, the issue is that their friends disapproved, leading them to question their stance.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, such guidelines might be common, while in others, they're seen as controlling. The author's friends' reaction suggests that in their social circle, this view is unpopular. But that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; it's more about differing values.\n\nAnother angle: if the author's wife agrees, then they're on the same page, which might be important for their relationship. However, if the author's stance is based on jealousy or lack of trust, that could be problematic. The post says it's not a serious matter, so maybe it's just a preference.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If their opinion is a personal boundary that both they and their partner agree on, then it's their choice. But if they're applying pressure or making it a rule without considering their partner's perspective, that's different. The post mentions the wife agrees, so maybe it's mutual.\n\nJudging from the information given, the author isn't forcing anyone; they're sharing their view. Since the wife is okay with it too, the issue is the friends' disapproval. The author's perspective isn't necessarily wrong if it's a mutual agreement in their relationship. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue it's controlling. However, the key is that the author and their wife are aligned, so it's their personal choice.\n"
