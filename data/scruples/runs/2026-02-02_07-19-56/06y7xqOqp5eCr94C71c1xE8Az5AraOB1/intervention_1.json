      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender one-on-one. The author's wife agrees with this, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance might be based on jealousy or lack of trust, even if they're not in the relationship themselves. However, in many modern relationships, such interactions are considered acceptable unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. The friends' reaction could be because they see it as controlling or not trusting their partner. \n\nBut the author's wife agrees with the sentiment, which might mean they have mutual expectations. Still, the question is whether the author is wrong. It's a matter of personal belief and cultural norms. Some might say it's okay to have boundaries, others might think it's unnecessary. However, if the friends are in relationships themselves and this view could affect their own dynamics, maybe the author is imposing their beliefs without considering others. \n\nBut the author isn't in the situation where their opinion affects others' relationships, so maybe it's their personal belief. However, the friends turned their noses up, which could stem from differing values. The key here is whether the author's opinion is inherently wrong. Since personal views on relationships vary, but the author's stance might come off as judgmental or traditional, it's possible they are in the wrong for not respecting others' choices. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is just sharing their opinion without imposing it, maybe not. But given the context, the friends' disapproval suggests that the author's view is seen as outdated or controlling. I think the answer leans towards AITA meaning the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit torn. However, considering that mutual agreement between couples is important, but the author's friends might not share that, so the author's stance might be seen as imposing their views. So, Answer A.\n"
