I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, and they also wouldn't like it if the guy was married. Their wife agrees if roles were reversed. But their friends disapproved.\n\nHmm. First, relationships are pretty personal, right? What's acceptable varies a lot between couples. The author's stance is about their own comfort level. But the friends think it's wrong. So, is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author isn't forcing anyone. They're expressing their feelings. If their wife agrees with the same boundaries, then maybe it's their mutual decision. But some people might see it as being overly controlling or distrustful. The key here is whether the author's views are respecting their wife's autonomy. If there's mutual agreement and no harm, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But others might argue that it's setting up unnecessary restrictions. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. It's not inherently wrong to have personal boundaries, but if those boundaries are based on jealousy or lack of trust without cause, that could be an issue. Since the author mentions the wife agrees, it's their mutual choice. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
