      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author expressed discomfort with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender, even if that person is married. Their wife agrees with this sentiment if the roles were reversed, but their friends reacted negatively. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's stance is that being in a relationship means they don't want their partner to meet someone of the opposite gender alone. They mention they wouldn't like it even if the other person is married. The key points here are about personal boundaries in relationships and societal norms around jealousy or possessiveness.\n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If both partners agree on certain boundaries, like not being alone with someone of the opposite gender, that's their choice. However, the author's friends disapproved, which might stem from different perspectives. Some people might see this as controlling or unnecessary, especially if there's no history of infidelity or trust issues.\n\nThe author's wife agreeing to the same if roles were reversed suggests mutual agreement, which is important. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If both partners are comfortable with these boundaries, it's their prerogative. However, if these rules are based on insecurity or jealousy without a valid reason, it could be seen as possessive. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for couples to set their own boundaries. The problem arises when these boundaries infringe on a partner's autonomy without mutual consent. Since the wife agrees, it's mutual. But friends might judge because social norms often encourage more openness unless there's a specific reason. \n\nThe challenge here is balancing personal feelings with respecting one's partner's autonomy. If the author's stance is causing conflict or unnecessary stress for their friends, that's a different issue. The friends' reaction might be about differing values rather than the author being wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, if both partners are okay with the arrangement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if they're imposing these rules without considering their partner's autonomy or if it's causing unnecessary jealousy, that could be problematic. Since the wife agrees, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
