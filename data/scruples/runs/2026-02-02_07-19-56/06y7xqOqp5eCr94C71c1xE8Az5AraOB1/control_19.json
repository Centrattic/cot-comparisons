Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about someone saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out 1-on-1 with a single guy of the opposite gender. The person also mentions they wouldn't like it if the guy was married either. Their friends disapproved, and the person is seeking judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine whether the author's viewpoint is wrong. The key here is consent and mutual agreement. The wife agrees with the same boundaries if roles were reversed, so there's mutual understanding between the couple. The author's preference is about personal boundaries in a relationship, not necessarily being disrespectful to others. \n\nSome might argue that it's up to each couple to decide their own boundaries. As long as both partners agree, it's their choice. However, others might say that in modern relationships, single people of the opposite gender can hang out without issues, and the author's opinion could be seen as controlling or based on outdated norms. But since the wife agrees, it's a mutual decision.\n\nThe friends disapproving might be due to differing views on what's acceptable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since there's no coercion or harm mentioned, just a personal boundary that the couple agrees on, it's likely not the author's fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
