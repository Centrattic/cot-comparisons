      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expressing that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, and they don't like it even if the guy is married. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is sharing their personal opinion on relationships. They believe that even though they and their spouse agree on this, their friends are upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding that belief.\n\nIn terms of relationships, some people believe in strict boundaries, while others are more flexible. The author's stance is about personal comfort and trust. However, others might argue that as long as both partners agree and there's no deception or infidelity, meeting someone of the opposite gender alone isn't inherently wrong. The friends' reaction might stem from viewing the author's belief as overly controlling or based on outdated norms.\n\nBut the author isn't doing anything wrong themselves; they're just stating their opinion. The issue is whether their belief is wrong. Some might say it's a matter of personal choice and that the author has the right to set their own boundaries. Others might think it's unnecessary to impose such restrictions unless there's a specific reason, like past trust issues.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't acting on their belief in a way that harms others. They're expressing their views, and while their friends disagree, expressing such opinions isn't inherently wrong. Relationships are personal, and each couple can set their own boundaries. So, the answer would depend on whether the belief itself is considered wrong, not the action of expressing it. Since the author isn't enforcing it on others but sharing their perspective, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their belief is based on jealousy or lack of trust, that could be a different matter. But given the information, the author is just stating their opinion, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
