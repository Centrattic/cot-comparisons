      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person (AITA, or \"Am I the Asshole\") says they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. They mention that they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting and hanging out with a single guy one-on-one. They also added that they wouldn't like it even if the guy was married, but their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed. However, their friends disapproved, and they're asking for a judgment.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is expressing their personal feelings about their spouse interacting with someone of the opposite gender. They aren't necessarily saying it's wrong universally, but rather that they themselves wouldn't be okay with it. Their wife agrees with them, which is interesting. That mutual agreement might be a key point here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to think about societal norms, personal boundaries, and the dynamics of relationships.\n\nOn one hand, some people might argue that the author is oversteering. They might say that as long as their wife is comfortable and the interactions are appropriate, it's none of their business. They could see it as controlling or not trusting their partner. In modern relationships, many people value autonomy and trust, so this stance could be seen as restrictive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own feelings and boundaries. They're not forcing their spouse to do anything; rather, they're sharing their personal discomfort. Their wife agrees with them, which suggests mutual understanding. So, if both partners are on the same page, maybe the author isn't wrong. It's about their own comfort level in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the friends' reaction. The friends \"turned their noses up,\" which might indicate that the author's view is not the majority opinion. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong. People have different values and relationship styles. What's important is the consent and agreement between the partners involved, not societal judgment.\n\nI should also think about the part where the author says they wouldn't like their wife hanging out with a single guy but also a married guy. That part might be different. If they disapprove regardless of the guy's relationship status, it's more about gender boundaries. However, the focus here is on the author's personal feelings, not making a general rule.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author and their spouse are both comfortable with their boundaries, then it's their choice. The friends' disapproval doesn't mean the author is wrong unless there's a violation of agreed-upon norms. Since the wife agrees, it's a mutual decision, which is valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not necessarily wrong because they are expressing their personal boundaries within a consensual relationship. The friends' disapproval doesn't negate that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
