      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author expressed discomfort with their partner hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The friends reacted negatively, and the author is seeking judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship where their wife agrees with the sentiment if roles were reversed. So there's mutual understanding here. But the friends disapproved. The question is whether the author's stance is wrong.\n\nPersonal boundaries vary. Some people are okay with their partners having one-on-one interactions with others of the opposite gender, while others are not. It's a matter of individual preferences and cultural norms. There's no universal right or wrong here. The author is stating their opinion, which is valid unless it's causing harm or violating agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that their wife agrees, so it's a mutual agreement. That's important because it means both partners are on the same page. The issue arises when friends judge the author. But friends' opinions don't necessarily dictate right or wrong. The key is whether the author's rules are being imposed without consent. Since the wife agrees, there's no coercion. \n\nHowever, some might argue that this stance could be seen as controlling or a lack of trust. But if both partners have consented to these boundaries, it's their choice. The problem comes if one partner is pressured into agreeing. Since the post doesn't indicate that, it's hard to say the author is wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is respecting their partner's autonomy and if there's mutual consent. Since both agree, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
