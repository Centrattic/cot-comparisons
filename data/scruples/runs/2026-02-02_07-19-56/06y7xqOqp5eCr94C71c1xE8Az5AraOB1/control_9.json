      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their wife meeting a single person of the opposite gender one-on-one, even if that person is married. They mentioned that their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship and shares their opinion, which is a personal boundary. The question is whether this opinion makes them the \"wrong\" in the scenario. \n\nBoundaries in relationships can vary. Some people are more possessive or have specific comfort levels. The author isn't saying their wife can't meet other people; they just have a preference about the gender and relationship status of the person. However, in many modern relationships, friends of the opposite gender are common and not necessarily a red flag. \n\nThe author's stance might be seen as controlling or lacking trust. If the wife agrees, maybe it's a mutual boundary. But friends disapproving might be because they view this as unnecessary jealousy or a sign of insecurity. \n\nLegally or ethically, there's no right or wrong here. It's about personal values and relationship dynamics. The problem is whether the author's opinion is unreasonable. If both partners agree, it's their choice. However, the friends' reaction suggests that the author's view might be considered outdated or overly possessive by some standards. \n\nThe key points: The author's opinion is a personal boundary. As long as both partners agree, it's not inherently wrong. But if it's causing issues with friends or limiting the partner's social interactions without mutual consent, it could be problematic. Since the wife agrees, the author might not be in the wrong from their relationship's perspective, but socially, some might judge them for being too restrictive. \n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the boundaries are mutual and respectful. Since the wife agrees, and it's a personal choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But friends have the right to disapprove without it making the author wrong. The question is about the author's stance, not the friends' reactions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
