      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author said they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy, and they also wouldn't like it if he were married. Their wife agrees, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's opinion is objectively wrong. The key here is about personal boundaries in relationships. Jealousy or discomfort with a partner spending time alone with someone of the opposite gender isn't necessarily wrong, as long as it's mutual and consensual. The author's wife agrees with the same boundaries, so there's mutual consent here. That's important because relationships are built on mutual agreements. \n\nHowever, societal norms vary. Some people might view this as controlling or possessive, especially if it's not based on trust. But the author isn't forbidding their wife; they just express their own discomfort. The wife's agreement is crucial. If both partners are comfortable with the same boundaries, it's their choice. \n\nThe friends' reaction might stem from the idea that relationships should involve trust and that such boundaries could be seen as unnecessary. But again, unless there's a breach of trust or agreed-upon boundaries, it's a matter of personal preference. The author isn't doing anything harmful here. They're stating their feelings, which their wife shares. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether personal boundaries in a consensual relationship are considered wrong. Since the author and spouse are in agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. The friends' judgment is their own opinion, not a factual wrongness. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
