      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their spouse hanging out alone with someone of the opposite gender who is single. Their friends disapproved, but the author's wife agrees with them if roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many relationships, there are varying degrees of comfort regarding how partners interact with others. The author's stance is that it's inappropriate for a person in a relationship to have 1-on-1 meetings with someone of the opposite gender who's single. The author's wife shares this view when roles are reversed, so there's mutual agreement there.\n\nBut the friends are critical. That might reflect differing opinions. Some people believe that as long as there's no romantic involvement, such meetings are fine. Others, especially in more conservative or traditional settings, might agree with the author. The key here is whether the author's view is inherently wrong, regardless of others' opinions.\n\nLegally, there's no issue. The author isn't violating any laws. Morally or socially, it's subjective. The author isn't imposing this view on others but stating their personal belief. Since their spouse agrees, there's no conflict in the relationship. The friends' judgment doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong; it's about differing values.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for holding this belief as long as they're not forcing their views on others. Their stance is a personal preference and aligned with their own relationship dynamics. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
