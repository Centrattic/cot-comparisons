      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out alone with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's wife agrees with him, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance is based on their personal belief about relationships and boundaries. They mention that even if the person is married, they wouldn't like it, but the main point is about someone single. Their wife agrees, so that's a mutual agreement, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might think that as long as there's no infidelity or explicit flirting, two people from opposite genders can hang out without issues. The friends' reaction suggests that they have different views, possibly valuing personal freedom and autonomy in interactions.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't imposing their views on others but expressing their own preferences. Since their partner agrees, there's mutual consent in their relationship. However, the question is whether the author is wrong in expressing this opinion. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a shift towards more liberal views regarding relationships and personal interactions. But personal boundaries can vary. The author isn't forcing others to follow their rules; they're just stating their comfort level. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether expressing such a viewpoint is considered wrong. Since the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by having their opinion, even if others disagree, they're not necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that it could be seen as judgmental or outdated. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the context shows mutual agreement between them and their spouse, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, others might say that it's a restrictive view and thus A. \n\nI think the key points are mutual agreement in the relationship and the fact that they're expressing their own boundaries, not enforcing them on others. So, likely answer B.\n"
