      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for expressing their opinion that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, and they also don't like it if the guy was married. They say their wife agrees, but their friends disapproved. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's stance on relationships and boundaries. They're stating a personal belief about what's appropriate for their spouse. But the friends are reacting negatively. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for having this opinion. In relationships, boundaries can vary widely between couples. What's important is that both partners agree on these boundaries. The author says their wife agrees with the same stance if the roles were reversed. So, there's mutual agreement between the couple. \n\nHowever, the friends' disapproval might stem from different cultural or personal norms. Some people might think that being in a relationship doesn't preclude having close, non-romantic friendships with others of the opposite sex. But others might agree that it could lead to complications or jealousy. \n\nThe author isn't imposing their views on others but expressing their personal boundaries. Since there's mutual consent in their relationship, they're not violating any norms within their own partnership. The friends' judgment is about the author's personal views, not necessarily an action that harms others. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having their opinion, especially since their partner agrees. The friends' reaction is about differing opinions, not a clear moral right or wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
