      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing their opinion about their spouse hanging out with someone of the opposite gender. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, even if the guy is married. Their friends disapproved, but the spouse agrees if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries in relationships. Some people are more traditional or have specific comfort levels. The author's stance isn't about their own actions but their partner's. They mention it's not a big deal because both agree. But friends think it's inappropriate.\n\nNow, societal norms vary. In some cultures, close interactions between a married person and someone of the opposite gender might be frowned upon, especially alone. However, others might see it as a personal choice as long as there's no infidelity.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement. Since the author's wife agrees and they both have the same boundaries, maybe it's their personal choice. But the author is imposing their view on their partner, which isn't inherently wrong if it's consensual. However, friends might argue that it's controlling or outdated.\n\nAlso, the author admits they wouldn't like it even if the other person is married. That could be seen as judgmental or prying. But if the partner is okay with it, it's between them. However, the author is setting a boundary they feel comfortable with, which is their right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If both partners agree and it doesn't harm anyone, then the author isn't wrong in expressing their boundary. The friends' disapproval is about differing opinions, not necessarily the author being wrong. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
