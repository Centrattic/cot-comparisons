      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, even if he's married. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. But their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's view is that even if someone is single, a person in a relationship shouldn't have one-on-one meetings with someone of the opposite gender. They might be concerned about potential jealousy, misinterpretation, or wanting to avoid any situations that could lead to infidelity or emotional connections. The wife agrees with this, so maybe it's a mutual boundary they've set.\n\nOn the other hand, friends might think this is too restrictive. In many modern relationships, friends of the opposite sex are considered acceptable, as long as the person is single. The key here is whether there's a mutual agreement between the couple. If both partners agree on the boundaries, then it's their choice. The friends' judgment doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just if the friends are right.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that even if the single person was married, they wouldn't like it. That part might be more about not wanting friends to meet other people's spouses, which is a common boundary. But when the person is single, it's different. However, the author's stance is about someone in a relationship not meeting a single person, which could be seen as unnecessary if the single person isn't in a relationship. But again, if both partners agree, it's their choice.\n\nSo, the main points are: mutual agreement between the couple, cultural or personal norms, and whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the author and their wife agree, and it's their personal decision, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the friends' disapproval is based on the idea that it's unnecessary or too controlling, that's a different angle. However, without more context about the relationships involved, it's hard to say. But generally, if a couple sets boundaries and they're comfortable with them, others' opinions don't make them wrong. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
