      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author says they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender one-on-one. They mentioned that their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's stance is about personal boundaries in a relationship. Whether that's right or wrong can depend on cultural norms, the nature of the relationship, and mutual agreement. In the US, for example, some people might see this as possessive or controlling, while others might respect it as a personal choice. The key here is that both the author and their spouse agree on these boundaries. If both partners are comfortable with the same rules, that's a mutual agreement. However, the friends' disapproval suggests that this isn't a universal opinion.\n\nI should think about what's considered healthy in relationships. Open communication and mutual respect are important. If the author and their spouse have discussed and agreed on these boundaries, it's their choice. But if the author is imposing these rules without the spouse's consent, that could be an issue. However, the author mentions the spouse agrees. So, the problem might be that the author is projecting their personal preferences as a universal standard, hence the friends' disapproval.\n\nAnother angle: social norms vs. personal preferences. Some people might argue that as long as both parties in a relationship agree, their choices are valid. Others might see it as unnecessary to impose such restrictions. The author's friends likely fall into the latter group, thinking the author is being overly controlling. But the author's perspective is about maintaining trust and avoiding potential jealousy or discomfort.\n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural aspect. In some cultures, such boundaries are more common. But the question is more about personal relationships than cultural practices. The main point is whether the author is wrong for having these beliefs. If the author and spouse are okay with it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the author is making a universal statement without considering others' views, that could be problematic.\n\nThe user said they think the author is wrong, but maybe the answer isn't clear. The author's beliefs are their own, and as long as they and their partner agree, it's their choice. The friends' judgment is about differing opinions, not necessarily the author being \"in the wrong.\" However, if the author's stance is based on a belief that others should follow the same rules, that's where the conflict arises. The key is whether the author is enforcing their views on others or just setting personal boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is imposing their views on others vs. just stating their own preferences. Since the author is talking about their own relationship and spouse's agreement, they aren't wrong for having those boundaries. The friends' disapproval is about differing opinions, not an error on the author's part. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having these personal boundaries as long as they don't enforce them on others.\n"
