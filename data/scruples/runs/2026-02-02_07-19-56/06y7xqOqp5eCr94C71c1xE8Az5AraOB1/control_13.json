      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author believes it's inappropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's perspective is based on their personal boundaries in a relationship. Many people have different views on what's acceptable in relationships. The key here is whether the author's belief is objectively wrong, or just a personal preference.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author's stance might stem from a place of wanting to protect their relationship. However, some people argue that if the person is in a committed relationship, they have trust in their partner. The fact that the author's wife agrees if the roles were reversed suggests mutual understanding between them. \n\nFriends disapproving doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. It's more about differing opinions. The main question is if the author's belief is a valid personal choice or if it's unreasonable. Since the author isn't enforcing this on others but expressing their own view, it's more about their personal boundaries. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's their personal opinion and they have the right to set boundaries in their relationship.\n"
