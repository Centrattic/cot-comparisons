      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, even if the guy was married. Their friends disapproved, but the wife agrees if the situation were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal boundaries. Some people might see one-on-one time between two people of the opposite gender as normal, especially if they're just friends. But others, especially in more traditional or conservative settings, might view it as a potential problem, even if there's no explicit infidelity. The author's stance could stem from jealousy or a desire to maintain trust in the relationship. However, in many modern relationships, boundaries vary, and mutual trust is key. The wife agreeing to the same thing suggests they have a mutual understanding, which is good. The friends' reaction might be based on differing values. So, is the author wrong? It's subjective. If the couple is comfortable with their boundaries and both agree, then it's their choice. But if the author is imposing strict rules without considering their partner's perspective or the context, that could be an issue. However, since the wife agrees, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the friends' judgment is also part of the question. The answer depends on whether enforcing such a rule is fair. I think there's no absolute right or wrong here, but the author's perspective is valid if both partners are okay with it. So the answer might be B (No), as it's their personal choice and both agree.\n"
