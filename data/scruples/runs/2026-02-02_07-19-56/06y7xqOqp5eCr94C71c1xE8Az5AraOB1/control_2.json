      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. They said they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy of the opposite gender, even if the guy is married. Their wife agrees with them if the roles were reversed, but their friends are upset. \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of relationships and what's considered acceptable. In many relationships, especially in Western cultures, it's common for couples to have boundaries about meeting others of the opposite sex alone. But there's also a lot of variation based on individual trust, communication, and cultural norms.\n\nThe author's concern might stem from a place of wanting to maintain trust and avoid situations that could lead to jealousy or potential issues. If both partners agree on these boundaries, that's important. However, friends might view this as overly controlling or not trusting their partner, which could lead to judgment. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework usually looks at if the person's actions are unreasonable. The author is expressing a personal boundary, not necessarily dictating their wife's behavior. Since the wife agrees with them when roles are reversed, it suggests mutual understanding. Friends disapproving doesn't automatically make the author wrong, as personal boundaries are subjective. \n\nHowever, if the author is imposing these boundaries without considering their wife's feelings or if it's causing her distress, that could be problematic. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The key is whether the author's stance is about their own comfort and mutual agreement, which it seems to be. So, I think the answer is B (No), because personal boundaries in relationships are valid as long as they're mutual and not based on control or mistrust.\n"
