Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made the comment is in the wrong. The scenario is about the person expressing discomfort with their spouse hanging out one-on-one with a member of the opposite sex who's single. They mention that their wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In some cultures, there's a traditional view that partners should be cautious about alone time with others of the opposite sex. However, modern perspectives often emphasize trust and open communication between partners, suggesting that such outings aren't inherently wrong if both partners are comfortable.\n\nThe key here is that the author's spouse agrees with the same standard, which shows mutual understanding. The issue arises from the friends' disapproval. But friends' opinions don't necessarily define right or wrong. The main question is whether the author's stance is inherently wrong. Since there's no legal or ethical violation, just a personal boundary that both partners agree on, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's more about differing values and personal preferences. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
