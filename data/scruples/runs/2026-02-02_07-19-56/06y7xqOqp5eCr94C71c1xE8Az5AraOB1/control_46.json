      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship norms. Opinions on this can vary a lot. Some people believe in complete openness, while others have boundaries. The key here is that the author is expressing their own preference, not necessarily enforcing it on others. \n\nThe author mentions they wouldn't like their wife meeting a single guy alone. That's their personal boundary. The wife agrees, so it's mutual. Friends judging them might be because they have different views on relationships. \n\nIs the author wrong for having that belief? Not necessarily. Personal boundaries in relationships are subjective. As long as both partners agree, it's their choice. The friends' disapproval doesn't make the author wrong; it just shows differing perspectives.\n\nHowever, the author is making a judgment about others' actions. If they're telling others what's appropriate, that's different. But in this case, they're sharing their own stance and their wife's. So unless there's a specific wrongdoing, like controlling behavior, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
