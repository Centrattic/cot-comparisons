      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they're not okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's wife agrees with this, but their friends are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing a personal boundary about their spouse's interactions. They mention that even if the guy was married, they wouldn't like it. But the main issue is with a single person. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries can vary a lot. What's important here is that the author and their wife are on the same page. The friends' disapproval might be due to different views on relationships and autonomy. But the key point is mutual agreement between the couple. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, as long as both partners agree and there's no harm being done, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that being in a relationship doesn't mean you can't have friends of the opposite gender. But the author's stance is about personal comfort and boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's boundaries are reasonable and consensual. Since the wife agrees, it's a mutual decision, so the author isn't in the wrong. The friends' judgment is their own opinion, but the author isn't violating any universal moral rule here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
