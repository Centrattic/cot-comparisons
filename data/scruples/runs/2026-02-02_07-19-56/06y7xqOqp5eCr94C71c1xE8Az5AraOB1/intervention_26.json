I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's friends disapproved, and the wife agrees if roles were reversed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance is about boundaries in relationships. Some people might agree that it's a personal choice and that as long as everyone is comfortable, it's fine. On the other hand, others might think that setting such boundaries is reasonable to avoid jealousy or potential issues.\n\nBut the key here is that the author's wife agrees with the same rules if the situation were reversed. That mutual agreement might mean that their relationship has a shared understanding. However, friends not agreeing might be because they value individual freedom in friendships. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily being wrong, but it's a matter of differing opinions. Relationships can have various dynamics, and what's right can depend on the couple's comfort. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) since it's their mutual agreement and they're not harming anyone. But I need to check if there's a broader societal judgment here. Some might see it as controlling, but others as respecting boundaries. The question is subjective, but since the wife agrees, the author isn't in the wrong. So Answer B.\n"
