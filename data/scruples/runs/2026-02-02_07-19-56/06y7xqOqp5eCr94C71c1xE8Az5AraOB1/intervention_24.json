I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for expressing their opinion about relationships.\n\nThe author says they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out 1-on-1 with a single person of the opposite gender. They also mention that their friends disapproved, and they want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, opinions on relationship dynamics vary. Some people believe in strict boundaries, like no alone time with the opposite sex, while others think it's unnecessary. The author's wife agrees with them, which might mean they have mutual expectations. But friends turning their nose up suggests societal norms might be different.\n\nI need to consider if the author's stance is inherently wrong. Jealousy or possessiveness can be issues, but if both partners are comfortable, maybe it's their choice. However, the author's reasoning about \"appropriateness\" could be seen as controlling. The key is whether the opinion is harmful. Since the author's wife agrees, it's a mutual decision, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're enforcing this without considering their wife's autonomy, that's a problem. The friends' judgment is about social norms, not necessarily right or wrong. So, the answer might depend on personal boundaries and mutual agreement. The author isn't violating any laws, but their view might be seen as outdated. However, since both parties agree, it's not necessarily wrong. So answer B (No) because it's their choice as long as both consent.\n"
