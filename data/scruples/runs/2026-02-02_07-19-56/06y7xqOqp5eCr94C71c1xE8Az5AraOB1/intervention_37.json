      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out 1-on-1 with a single guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship and expressed discomfort about their partner meeting a single person of the opposite gender alone. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, in relationships, trust and communication are key. If both partners agree on boundaries, that's their choice. The author's wife agrees with the same standard, so maybe it's a mutual agreement. Some people might have boundaries about their partners spending time alone with others, especially of the opposite sex, to avoid potential issues. So from that angle, the author isn't necessarily wrong because it's about their own comfort and agreed-upon rules.\n\nOn the other hand, friends might see this as a form of jealousy or lack of trust. In many modern relationships, it's common to allow partners to have friends of the opposite sex, as long as it's respectful and doesn't cross into infidelity. The author's stance could be seen as controlling or not trusting their partner, which could be problematic. Also, the friends' negative reaction might stem from perceiving this as unnecessary restriction.\n\nBut since the author's wife agrees, it's a mutual decision. So maybe the author isn't wrong, but some might argue it's a conservative view. The answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs. However, since the author isn't forcing their wife to adhere to this and it's a mutual agreement, it's not inherently wrong. The friends' judgment is their opinion, but the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong if both parties consent.\n"
