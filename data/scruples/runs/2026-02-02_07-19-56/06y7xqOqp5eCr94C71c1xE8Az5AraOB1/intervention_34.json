I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author says they're uncomfortable with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy of the opposite gender. They also mention they wouldn't like it if their wife met someone else, even if that person was married. The author's wife agrees with this viewpoint if the roles were reversed. However, their friends reacted negatively to this opinion, and the author wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal boundaries. Some people believe that in a relationship, certain boundaries should exist regarding interactions with others of the opposite sex, especially one-on-one. Others might argue that such restrictions are outdated or unnecessary, promoting trust and autonomy.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's inappropriate, which they feel is their right. Their wife agrees, which means there's mutual consent in the relationship. However, friends disapprove, possibly viewing it as controlling or not trusting the wife. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners have the right to set boundaries as long as they're mutual and respectful. The key here is that the author and their wife are on the same page, so it's a mutual agreement. The issue arises only when others (friends) judge this. The author isn't harming anyone; it's their personal choice. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong unless their actions infringe on others' autonomy. \n\nHowever, if the author were to enforce this unilaterally without the wife's consent, that would be problematic. But in this case, the wife agrees. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's their shared boundary. Still, some might argue that such views can be seen as possessive or traditional, but that's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, since both partners agree and there's no harm, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
