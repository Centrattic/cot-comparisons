      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their wife meeting a single person of the opposite gender one-on-one, even if the other person is married. Their friends disapproved, but the wife agrees with the author's viewpoint if roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is unreasonable. The key here is the context of relationships and personal boundaries. Many relationships have different norms about interactions with others of the opposite sex. The author's perspective is about what they find appropriate, and their spouse shares a similar viewpoint. However, friends are criticizing them for this, leading to the question of whether the author is wrong.\n\nIn terms of general social norms, while some people might find one-on-one interactions between opposite genders inappropriate in a relationship, others might consider it harmless as long as there's no infidelity. The author isn't restricting their wife's actions but expressing discomfort. Since the wife agrees with the author's stance, there's mutual understanding in the relationship. Friends' disapproval doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong, especially if both partners are okay with the rules they've set.\n\nIt's important to note that relationship dynamics are personal. Unless there's an agreement to be exclusive, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The friends' judgment is their own opinion, but that doesn't make the author's feelings invalid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because personal boundaries vary, and mutual consent in the relationship is key.\n"
