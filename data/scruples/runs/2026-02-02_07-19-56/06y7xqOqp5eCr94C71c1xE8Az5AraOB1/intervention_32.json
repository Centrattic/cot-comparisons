I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out alone with a single guy. The author's friends criticized them, but their wife agrees with the sentiment if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship where both partners agree on this boundary. The question is whether having such a boundary makes the author wrong. \n\nSome might argue that in a healthy relationship, trust is key, and restricting social interactions based on gender could be seen as controlling or rooted in outdated gender norms. Others might say that everyone has their own boundaries, and as long as both partners agree, it's their choice. \n\nThe author isn't enforcing this on their wife; they're expressing their personal discomfort. However, the friends' reaction suggests that the author's view might not align with more modern perspectives on relationships where independence and friendship across genders are valued. \n\nBut the author's wife agrees, so it's a mutual decision. The key is whether having such a boundary is inherently wrong. It depends on the relationship dynamics. If it's causing no harm and both are comfortable, maybe not. However, the broader societal judgment is that such restrictions might not be necessary. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because their stance might be seen as restrictive or based on mistrust. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if personal boundaries are respected. \n\nGiven that the author's wife agrees, but friends disapprove, it's a matter of perspective. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and considering that many would argue for mutual trust and freedom in relationships, the author's stance might be considered outdated or controlling. So, probably answer A.\n"
