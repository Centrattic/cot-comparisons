      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentioned they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting a single guy one-on-one, even if that guy was married. Their wife agrees if the situation were reversed, but their friends are upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's viewpoint is based on their personal boundaries and trust in their relationship. They believe that even if the other person is single, it's inappropriate. However, others might argue that this is controlling or lacks trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If both partners agree on the same boundaries, like the author's wife agreeing with the rule if roles were reversed, then it's their mutual decision. But the friends' reaction suggests that they see this as an overreach, maybe because they believe adults should have the freedom to socialize without such restrictions unless there's a specific issue.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. Some people might find it acceptable for partners to have one-on-one interactions, while others might not. The author's stance could be seen as traditional or protective. However, if the wife is okay with it, then it's a matter of personal preference rather than right or wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their opinion. Since the author's wife agrees and they have a mutual understanding, the author isn't necessarily wrong in their own relationship. But if they were imposing this on others without their consent, that could be an issue. Since the scenario is about their own relationship and mutual agreement, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the friends' disapproval is about social judgment, but that doesn't make the author wrong if their relationship is healthy and consensual.\n"
