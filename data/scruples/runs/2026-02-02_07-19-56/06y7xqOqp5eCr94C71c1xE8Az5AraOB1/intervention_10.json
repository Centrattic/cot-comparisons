I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author expressed discomfort with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender, and their friends disapproved. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's stance is based on personal feelings about appropriateness in a relationship. They mentioned that their wife agrees if roles were reversed, which shows mutual agreement. However, the friends' reaction is negative.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. It's important to recognize that relationship norms can vary. What's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The author isn't imposing this on others but expressing their own views. Since their spouse agrees, there's mutual consent. The friends' disapproval doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; everyone has different boundaries. However, some might argue that single people hanging out with someone of the opposite gender isn't inherently wrong, and the author's view could be seen as overly restrictive without a valid reason. But the key point here is that the author and their spouse are on the same page, so their own relationship isn't at issue. The friends' judgment is their own, but the author isn't harming anyone by stating their opinion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because it's their personal boundary, and they're not forcing it on others.\n"
