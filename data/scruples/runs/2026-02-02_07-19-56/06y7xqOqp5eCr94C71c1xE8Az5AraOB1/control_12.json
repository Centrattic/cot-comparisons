      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario. The author states that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. They mentioned that they wouldn't be okay with their wife meeting and hanging out with a single guy one-on-one, even if the guy is married. The author's wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and personal boundaries. The author is expressing their personal discomfort with their spouse interacting with someone of the opposite gender in a one-on-one setting. This is about their own feelings and boundaries, not necessarily a universal rule. However, the friends are judgmental, which suggests differing opinions on what's acceptable in relationships.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to note that personal boundaries vary. What's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The author isn't imposing this on others but stating their own feelings. However, their stance might be seen as controlling or lacking trust in their spouse if taken to an extreme.\n\nBut since the author is in a consensual relationship where their spouse agrees with the same boundaries, it's a mutual understanding. The friends' disapproval doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's more about differing perspectives on relationships and trust. The key here is that both partners agree on the boundaries, which is crucial for a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, the answer likely is B (No), because the author isn't wrong if both they and their spouse agree on the boundaries. However, I should be cautious because some might argue that such views could lead to controlling behavior. But given the mutual agreement, it's within their right to set those boundaries.\n"
