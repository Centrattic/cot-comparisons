I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expressed discomfort with their wife spending time 1-on-1 with a single guy, and their friends reacted negatively. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship where both they and their wife agree on this boundary. So, their stance is mutual. Now, whether this makes them wrong depends on societal norms and personal beliefs. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being possessive or overly controlling, which could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, if both partners agree on these boundaries, it's about their mutual consent and comfort. Relationships often have such personal boundaries, and the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by setting them.\n\nThe friends' reaction is about differing opinions. Just because the friends disapprove doesn't mean the author is wrong. It's a matter of personal choice. However, the author should also consider if their stance is based on trust or insecurity. If it's the latter, that could be a red flag. But the post doesn't indicate that. \n\nIn many cultures, some people do prefer their partners to avoid solo meetings with the opposite sex. So, the author isn't alone in this view. The key point is that both partners are on the same page. The author isn't harming anyone else's relationship here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their friends' judgment is subjective, but the author's position is valid as long as it's consensual within their relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
