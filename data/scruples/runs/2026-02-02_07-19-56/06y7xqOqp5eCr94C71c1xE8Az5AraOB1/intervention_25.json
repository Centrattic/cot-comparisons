I feel as though its inoppropite being in a relationship. Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author says that they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single person of the opposite gender. They also mentioned that they wouldn't like it if the person was married either. Their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. But their friends disapprove. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal boundaries. Some people believe that in a relationship, certain boundaries are necessary for trust and comfort. The author's stance might be based on their own insecurities or cultural norms. However, others might see this as controlling or a lack of trust, especially if the single person is just a friend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's wife agrees with the same boundaries, but friends are critical. The author isn't forcing anyone; it's their personal opinion. However, if the friends are in a relationship, their reaction might be different. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their opinion, not for enforcing it.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about whether the author's views are unreasonable. If the author is not violating any agreements or causing harm, maybe they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that they're being overly controlling. But since the wife agrees, it's mutual. The friends' disapproval might stem from differing views on relationships and trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong for having these feelings, especially if it's a mutual agreement with their spouse. However, it could be seen as restrictive by others. So the answer might be B (No), because it's their personal choice as long as both partners agree. But some might say A (Yes) if they think it's unnecessary control. Hmm.\n"
