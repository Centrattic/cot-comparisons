      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out one-on-one with a single guy. They also mentioned that if the guy was married, they wouldn't like that either. Their wife agrees with them, but their friends are giving them a hard time.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author is in a relationship, and their opinion is about what they find appropriate for their partner to do. The key point here is about personal boundaries in a relationship. They're not saying it's okay for their wife to hang out with other guys, but they're specifically targeting single guys as well as married ones. So even if the guy is not in a relationship, the author still thinks it's inappropriate for their wife to meet him one-on-one.\n\nNow, the friends are judging them for this, and the author wants to know if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion.\n\nI need to think about common views on this. Many relationships have boundaries about how much partners can interact with others of the opposite sex, especially one-on-one. Some people are more open, while others are more restrictive. The author's stance isn't about cheating or infidelity directly, but about comfort with their partner spending time alone with someone else.\n\nThere are arguments both ways. Some might say that unless the partner is in a relationship with someone else, it's not a problem. Others might argue that any one-on-one interaction with someone of the opposite sex could lead to issues, depending on the couple's agreement. The fact that the wife agrees with the author is a point in their favor, as mutual agreement on boundaries is important in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's friends disapprove. Friends might have different perspectives, especially if they value individual freedom and see this as controlling or unnecessary. The question is whether the author's belief is unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a shift towards more individual autonomy and less restriction on social interactions unless there's a breach of trust or agreement. If the couple has agreed that this is a boundary they're both comfortable with, then it's their choice. But if the author is imposing this view without considering their partner's comfort or if it's causing unnecessary conflict with friends, that might be a problem.\n\nBut the scenario says the wife agrees, so that's a mutual boundary. The author isn't in the wrong in terms of their own relationship dynamics. However, the friends' judgment is about social norms. The author's friends might think that the author is being overly controlling or not trusting their partner. But the author's perspective is based on their own comfort, and as long as both partners agree, it's their business.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a matter of personal preference and relationship boundaries. Unless there's a specific harm or violation of agreed terms, it's not necessarily wrong. The author isn't forcing their wife to do anything; they're expressing their own discomfort. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
