      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying that someone in a relationship shouldn't hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author's reasoning is that it's inappropriate, and even though their spouse agrees with the sentiment if roles were reversed, their friends disapproved. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The situation is about personal boundaries in a relationship. The author is expressing their own feelings about what's acceptable regarding their partner's interactions with others. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and personal boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions that their wife agrees with the sentiment if the roles were reversed. That suggests both partners are on the same page regarding their boundaries. In that case, the author's stance isn't violating their partner's autonomy since they've discussed and agreed. So, from their mutual perspective, it's a consensual boundary.\n\nHowever, friends turning their noses up might indicate societal norms or different views on relationships. Some people might see such restrictions as controlling or unnecessary, especially if the interactions are platonic. But the question is whether the author is technically in the wrong, not whether their friends' opinions are valid.\n\nIn terms of ethics, unless the author is enforcing this unilaterally without the partner's consent or if the interactions are non-consensual or harmful, it's more about their mutual agreement. Since the author states that their wife agrees, it's within their relationship's dynamics. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting their mutual boundaries.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that such restrictions could lead to possessiveness or lack of trust. But without evidence of harm or coercion, it's their choice as a couple. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
