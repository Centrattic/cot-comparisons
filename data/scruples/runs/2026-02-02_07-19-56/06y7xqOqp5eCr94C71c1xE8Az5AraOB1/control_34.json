Its not too serious of a matter because my wife agrees (being the roles be reversed), but my friends turned their noses up at me and I wanted an  judgement. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out alone with a single guy. The author's wife agrees if the roles were reversed, but their friends disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing a personal boundary regarding their partner's interactions with someone of the opposite gender. They're not imposing this on others but sharing their own feelings. The wife agrees with the sentiment, so it's mutual in their relationship.\n\nNow, societal norms vary. Some people believe that in a relationship, partners should have boundaries about interacting with others of the opposite sex, while others see it as unnecessary and restrictive. The friends' disapproval might stem from a different perspective, maybe valuing individual freedom more.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance is inherently wrong. If the author and their wife are both comfortable with these boundaries, it's their choice. The issue is that the author is sharing their opinion and seeking validation, not enforcing it on others. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings. The friends' judgment is their own, but the author isn't violating any rights or norms by expressing their personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
