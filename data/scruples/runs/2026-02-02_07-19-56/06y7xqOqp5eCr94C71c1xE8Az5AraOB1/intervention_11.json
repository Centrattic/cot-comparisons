      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out with a single person of the opposite gender. The author mentioned this during a conversation with friends, and their wife agrees if roles were reversed. The friends disapproved, leading the author to seek judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's stance is about personal boundaries in a relationship. It's their opinion, and they're sharing it with friends. The key here is that the author isn't enforcing this on others but expressing their own views. However, friends turning their noses up suggests a clash in perspectives. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural or personal beliefs. In some cultures, such views might be traditional, while others see it as unnecessary. The question is about whether the author's opinion itself is wrong, not the friends' reaction. \n\nThe author isn't imposing rules on others; they're stating their own comfort level. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, personal opinions, even if they differ from others, aren't inherently wrong. The friends disapproving might have their own reasons, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that such views could be seen as controlling or rooted in gender stereotypes. The author's agreement with the wife's reciprocal stance might mitigate that, but it's still subjective. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's opinion is a personal boundary, and unless it's causing harm, it's not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
