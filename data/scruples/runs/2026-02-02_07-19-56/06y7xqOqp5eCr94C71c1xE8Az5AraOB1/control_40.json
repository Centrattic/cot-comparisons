      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for saying they wouldn't be okay with their wife hanging out alone with a single guy. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship and expressed that they don't think it's appropriate for someone in a relationship to hang out one-on-one with a person of the opposite gender who's single. They also mention that their wife agrees if the roles were reversed. But their friends disapproved.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's opinion is wrong. Well, it's their personal boundary, right? As long as both partners are on the same page, it's their choice. The author isn't imposing this on their wife; they just share their own feelings. Their friends' reaction is about differing views on relationships. Some people might think that being in a relationship doesn't mean you can't have friends of the opposite sex. But the author's stance is about their own comfort level. Since their wife agrees with the mutual exclusivity, there's no betrayal or harm. So the author isn't necessarily wrong for having those feelings. It's a personal preference within their relationship. Unless there's coercion, it's their decision. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
