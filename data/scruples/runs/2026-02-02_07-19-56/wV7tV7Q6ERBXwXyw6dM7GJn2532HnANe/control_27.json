This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on and needed to go to the bathroom. The first door was closed, but the light was off. They went to open the shower part and saw light and steam, then apologized and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in there. The author explained that in their family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. The roommate and the author's boyfriend thought the author was in the wrong for not understanding that closed doors mean occupied.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether closing the bathroom door for energy reasons is a socially accepted norm. The author's explanation is that in their household, doors were closed to save energy, which is a valid reason. However, in many other contexts, a closed door with the light off might be mistaken for unoccupied, but if the door is closed and the light is on, it's more obvious someone is inside. The author saw light and steam, which are indicators that someone is in there. But they still opened the door, assuming it's for energy efficiency. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasoning is a socially acceptable norm. In many places, a closed door with the light off might be less obvious, but the presence of steam and light from the bathroom would suggest someone is using it. The author made a mistake by opening the door despite those signs. However, their intention wasn't malicious\u2014they apologized quickly. The roommate, on the other hand, seems to be enforcing a strict norm that the author wasn't aware of. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did make a mistake by not recognizing the signs, but their reasoning comes from a different cultural or household norm. The roommate's reaction is also extreme, as the author apologized and learned from the mistake. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might not be fair if they don't consider the author's perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author made an error in judgment, it's partly due to differing social norms. The roommate overreacted, but the author isn't entirely blameless. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they intended no harm and corrected their mistake, maybe they aren't the asshole. But maybe they still did something wrong by not checking properly despite the signs. This is a bit tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mistake was unintentional and they apologized, but some might argue A. However, considering the context of different household norms, B makes sense.\n"
