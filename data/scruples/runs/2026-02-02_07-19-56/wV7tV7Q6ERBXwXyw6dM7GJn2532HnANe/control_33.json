This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off. They opened the shower door and saw light and steam. They apologized and left. The roommate exploded about it, saying doors being closed means someone is in there. The author explains their background of keeping doors closed for energy efficiency. The boyfriend and roommate side with him, saying she lost the argument.\n\nSo, the question is, is she wrong? From a general social norm perspective, if a door is closed, it's usually a sign someone is inside. Even if the light is off, opening it without checking (maybe knocking first?) could be seen as a breach of privacy. But the author's reasoning is that in her family, doors are closed for energy, not privacy. However, in most contexts, closed doors do indicate someone is using the room. \n\nThe key points here are: She made a mistake, apologized, and explained her reasoning. The roommate and boyfriend took it as a lack of courtesy, not understanding the social norm. The author didn't intend to intrude but did so because of a different upbringing. \n\nIn most societies, the norm is that a closed door means someone is inside. So even if she had good intentions, she violated that norm. But she did apologize and was sorry. However, the roommate's reaction is also a bit harsh, maybe overreacting. But the question is about the author's fault. Since she didn't mean to be rude but made a mistake that caused an issue, she might be partially at fault. But in some contexts, maybe she's not wrong because she followed her family's norms. \n\nBut generally, the standard social norm is that closed doors mean someone is in there. So even if she had a different background, she's in a new environment where people have different expectations. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't follow the common expectation, leading to an invasion of privacy. However, the fact that she apologized and didn't mean to be rude might mitigate it. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. In terms of social norms, she is. So the answer would be A.\n"
