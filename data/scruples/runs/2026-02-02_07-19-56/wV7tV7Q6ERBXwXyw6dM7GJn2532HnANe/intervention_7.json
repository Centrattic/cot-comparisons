This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation is about a cultural or social norm misunderstanding.\n\nSo the author had headphones on and had to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off. They opened the part leading to the shower, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate took offense, saying it's about common courtesy. The author explained that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone's inside. The boyfriend and roommate agreed the author was in the wrong, but the author is confused because they apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. In many places, a closed bathroom door with the light on usually means someone is in there. The author's explanation is about energy efficiency, which is valid, but the key point here is the roommate's experience. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be rude, the action still invaded the roommate's privacy. The author did see a light and steam, so maybe they should have realized someone was in there, but they didn't check. The apology was given, but the roommate felt disrespected. \n\nThe author's argument is that their background is different, but in a shared living situation, it's important to adapt to the house's norms. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the author did make a mistake by opening the door without confirming if it was occupied. Even if the initial door was closed with the light off, the shower area's door being closed with light and steam on the other side is a clear sign. The author might not have considered that their family's practices differ from standard social cues in shared spaces. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to be rude, the action was a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction is understandable because privacy is a big deal. The author's explanation is about their personal habits, but in this case, the social norm of respecting closed doors as a sign of occupation is more critical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to respect the roommate's privacy, even if unintentionally.\n"
