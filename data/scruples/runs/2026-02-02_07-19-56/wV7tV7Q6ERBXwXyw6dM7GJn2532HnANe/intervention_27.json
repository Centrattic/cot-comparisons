This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she accidentally walked into her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. She had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off. She went to open the shower part, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate got really upset about it, saying she was being rude because closed doors mean someone's in there. She explained that in her family and her own house, they close doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and her boyfriend think she's an asshole, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. In many places, a closed door with the light off might be assumed to be unoccupied. But in other situations, people might close doors for other reasons. The key point here is that the roommate interpreted the closed door as the opposite of occupied, which she didn't. So her mistake was opening the door, thinking it was unoccupied, but in reality, he was in the shower. \n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. She did apologize, but the roommate felt that her action was rude because she didn't respect the social norm of a closed door indicating someone is inside. However, she had a valid reason for closing doors (energy efficiency) which is common in her household. The problem is that social norms can vary. The roommate and her bf think that the closed door was a clear sign, so opening it was a breach of courtesy. But from her perspective, she wasn't aware of that norm. \n\nIs she the asshole? Well, she made a mistake, but she wasn't intentionally trying to be rude. She apologized. The roommate's reaction might be overblown, but she did enter without checking properly. The energy efficiency argument doesn't change the fact that in many cultures, a closed door is a signal not to enter. Even if she had a reason for closing doors, the roommate's expectation was that if the door is closed, someone is inside. Her action of opening it without checking (even if she thought the light being off meant it was unoccupied) led to an awkward situation. \n\nThe roommate and her bf think she's in the wrong because the social norm is more important than energy efficiency in this case. The author's mistake was not understanding that norm. But is that her fault? Maybe she just wasn't aware, which is a cultural difference. However, once she entered and saw someone in the shower, she immediately apologized. The main issue is whether the initial act of entering was a breach of courtesy. \n\nIn most social contexts, closing the door when using the bathroom indicates you don't want to be disturbed. So the author's action, while perhaps based on a different cultural norm, still resulted in an intrusion. The roommate's reaction might be harsh, but the act itself was a mistake. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't check properly and her action, regardless of intent, was a social faux pas. However, if the answer is B (No), it's because she didn't have malicious intent and had a valid reason for her behavior. \n\nBut given that social norms often prioritize respecting the privacy indicated by a closed door, even if other reasons exist for closing doors, the author did make the mistake. Therefore, she's in the wrong, but maybe not an asshole. The question is if she's the asshole. The roommate's reaction is intense, but the act itself is a mistake. Since the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework often looks at intent and the ability to see the other person's perspective, she might not be the asshole. Wait, but she did walk into someone in the shower, which is a privacy violation. So even if unintentional, it's a breach. But she apologized and didn't mean to. So maybe she's not the asshole, but the roommate overreacted. Hmm. \n\nThis is tricky. In some cases, accidental actions aren't considered asshole behavior if the person is sorry and didn't mean to. But walking into someone in the shower is a major privacy issue. The roommate's reaction is understandable. The author's own explanation is that she didn't know the norm, but the result was a privacy breach. So maybe she is in the wrong, but not an asshole. The question is phrased as \"Am I the Asshole?\" So the options are A (Yes) or B (No). The answer depends on whether the mistake is considered asshole behavior. In many cases, people who make mistakes without intent aren't considered assholes. However, the act of walking into someone's shower is a privacy violation, which is a big deal. So perhaps she's not the asshole because she didn't mean to, but the roommate's reaction is valid. However, the roommate's perspective is that she was intentionally rude by not respecting the closed door. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't check properly and her action led to a privacy violation, even if unintentional. But others might say B (No) because she had a valid reason and apologized. But given the standard norms, the act itself is a mistake, so A.\n"
