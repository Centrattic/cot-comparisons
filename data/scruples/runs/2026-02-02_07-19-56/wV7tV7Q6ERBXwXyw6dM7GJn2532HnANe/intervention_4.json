This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had headphones on, was in a hurry to use the bathroom. The bathroom door was shut but the light was off, so she assumed it was empty. Then she went to open the shower part and saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, arguing that closed doors with lights off indicate someone's in there. The author's reasoning was based on energy efficiency, coming from a large family where they kept doors closed for that reason. She apologized and was sorry, but the roommate and her boyfriend thought she was being rude.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author's mistake was significant enough to be considered in the wrong. The key factors here are intent, cultural norms, and the context of the situation. \n\nThe author didn't mean to invade privacy; she made an honest mistake. Her reasoning for keeping doors closed was practical (energy savings), which is a valid point. However, in many social contexts, especially in shared living spaces, a closed door with the light off might be interpreted as unoccupied. If someone has the door open or the light on, that's a more obvious sign someone is there. But in this case, the shower door was closed but the bathroom door was shut with the light off. \n\nBut wait, she opened the shower part. Maybe the roommate was in the shower, so the main bathroom door was closed, but the shower door was open? Or maybe the structure of the bathroom is such that you first enter the bathroom, then there's a shower area with a door. She opened the second door (the shower door) and saw light and steam. So maybe the bathroom door was closed, but the shower door was closed as well? Wait, the user said \"First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off.\" So the main bathroom door was closed and the light was off. Then she went to open the part to the shower. When she opened that, she saw light and steam. So perhaps inside the bathroom, the shower area had a door, and when she opened that, she saw the roommate in the shower. \n\nSo, she assumed the bathroom was empty because the main door was closed and the light was off. She went to open the shower door and saw the roommate. The roommate was in the shower, so maybe the main bathroom light was off, but the shower area had a light on? Or steam indicated someone was using the shower. \n\nThe roommate argues that closed doors and lights off mean someone is in there, but the author's background shows that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency. However, in shared living spaces, especially with roommates, social norms might prioritize privacy and assuming a closed door means someone is inside. \n\nThe author apologized and took responsibility for the mistake, but the roommate was upset about the invasion of privacy. Even if the mistake was unintentional, the outcome was a breach of privacy. So, while the author didn't intend to be rude, her action did lead to an invasion of the roommate's privacy. \n\nThe question is whether this makes her the asshole. The key points are: she made a mistake, apologized, and had a different cultural background. However, in most shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is a higher priority than energy efficiency. The roommate's reaction might be excessive, but the fact remains that the author's action led to an awkward and potentially uncomfortable situation for the roommate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author's reasoning is valid in her context, when living with others, it's important to adapt to their norms unless you can clearly explain and agree on different practices. The author tried to explain her reasoning, but the roommate and her boyfriend didn't accept it, thinking she was being rude. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to be rude and apologized, the action itself was a mistake that invaded someone's privacy. Therefore, she might be considered in the wrong because she failed to consider that in a shared space, the social norm is to assume a closed door with the light off is unoccupied. Wait, no, actually, maybe the opposite. If the bathroom door is closed, that usually means someone is inside. If the light is off, maybe the assumption is that it's unoccupied. But in some cases, people might leave the door closed even when they're not using it for privacy. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, the user said the bathroom door was shut but the light was off. She went to open the shower door and saw light and steam. So the bathroom light was off, but the shower area had a light on. Maybe the shower door was closed, but the steam indicated someone was in there. So even though the main bathroom light was off, the presence of steam and light in the shower area showed someone was using it. \n\nIn that case, the author might not have been entirely wrong to assume the bathroom was unoccupied because the main door was closed and the light was off. However, the roommate's perspective is that even if the main light is off, if the shower area is in use, the door should be closed to indicate someone is there. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. The author made a mistake, but she apologized and didn't intend to invade privacy. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the invasion of privacy did occur. \n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the user is often considered the asshole if they knowingly or recklessly caused discomfort. Here, it was an honest mistake. However, the author might have ignored the possibility that even if the bathroom door was closed and the light off, the shower could still be in use. \n\nBut the author had a valid reason (energy efficiency) for her actions, but in a shared space, respecting others' privacy is a higher priority. So even if her reasoning is valid in her context, in the context of the roommate's expectations, she might be in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while it was a mistake, in a shared living environment, respecting privacy norms is essential. The author's energy-saving habits conflicted with the roommate's expectation of privacy, leading to an invasion of privacy, even if unintentional.\n"
