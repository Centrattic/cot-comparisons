This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The situation is that the author had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light was off, so they opened the shower partition door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about common courtesy, saying that closed doors mean someone's in there. The author explains that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and boyfriend thought the author was rude.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author made a mistake. They did open the door without checking properly, which led to an awkward situation. However, their intention wasn't to invade privacy; they were just trying to save energy. The key points here are intent and societal norms. \n\nIn many cultures, a closed door usually signifies that someone is inside, especially in shared living spaces. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid, but their assumption that the door was closed for that reason might not align with the roommate's expectations. The author did apologize, which shows they recognized the mistake. The roommate's reaction seems overly harsh, but the author did make an error in judgment by not verifying if the room was occupied before entering.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the mistake was unintentional and they apologized, the action still caused an invasion of privacy. However, the roommate's interpretation of the situation as a major breach of courtesy might be more about personal sensitivity than the author's malice. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't completely negate the mistake. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author did act in a way that, while not malicious, was socially inappropriate according to common expectations. Therefore, the answer would be A, they are in the wrong, but with nuance.\n"
