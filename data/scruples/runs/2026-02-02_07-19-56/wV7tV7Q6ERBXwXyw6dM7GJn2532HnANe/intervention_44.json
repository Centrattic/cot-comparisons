This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door to the shower and seeing the roommate. The main issue here is whether the author misunderstood the social norms regarding bathroom doors.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they saw the bathroom door closed with the light off, so they assumed it was unoccupied. They opened the shower door and found the roommate in the shower. The roommate was upset, thinking that closed doors with the light off indicated someone was inside. The author comes from a large family where doors are kept closed for energy efficiency, not privacy. They apologized, but the roommate and the author's bf think the author was inconsiderate.\n\nNow, considering social norms: in most places, a closed bathroom door with the light on usually signals someone is using the bathroom. If the light is off, maybe it's unoccupied, but the shower might still be in use. However, the author didn't check if the door was locked or if there was a sign (like a \"do not disturb\" sign) which some people use. The author's mistake was opening the shower door without verifying if someone was inside. Even though their intention was to save energy, accidentally seeing someone in the shower is a privacy violation. \n\nThe roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the author did make an error in judgment. They didn't consider that the shower could be occupied even if the light was off. The main point is that the author failed to ensure the bathroom was unoccupied, leading to an invasion of privacy. While the author apologized, the initial action was a mistake. So, the answer is A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because they didn't take adequate steps to check if the bathroom was occupied, leading to a breach of privacy.\n"
