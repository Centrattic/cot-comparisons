This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The key points here are about the social norms regarding bathroom door usage.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. She noticed the first door was closed but the light was off, so she assumed the bathroom was unoccupied. Then she opened the part leading to the shower and saw light and steam. She apologized and left. The roommate took offense, saying that closed doors with the light off indicate someone is in there. The author explains that in her family of eight, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to signal occupation. Her BF and the roommate think she's in the wrong for not knowing the standard.\n\nNow, social norms can vary. In many places, especially in shared living situations, a closed door is a clear sign someone is using the bathroom. The light being off might be a red flag, but the author didn't check the light. However, she did see steam, which is another indicator. The roommate's main issue seems to be the lack of common courtesy, expecting the door to be left closed as a sign of privacy. The author's mistake was understandable but still a breach of privacy. She apologized, but the roommate felt it was a big deal. The author's reasoning is valid in her context, but in the roommate's context, the closed door was the norm. So, the question is whether the author's action, though accidental, was still a violation of expected behavior. \n\nThe BF and roommate's reaction might be based on their own social expectations. Even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the act of opening the door without checking (like knocking first or ensuring the light is on) is considered inconsiderate. The author's energy efficiency reasoning is a good point, but in shared spaces, respecting others' privacy is a higher priority. So, while the mistake was accidental, the standard here is about respecting the closed door as a privacy signal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't adhere to the common courtesy norms of the shared living situation, even though she had her own reasons.\n"
