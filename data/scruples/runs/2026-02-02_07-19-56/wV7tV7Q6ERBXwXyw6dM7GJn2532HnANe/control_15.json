This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So, the situation is she accidentally opened the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. She had headphones on, went to the bathroom first door which was closed but the light was off. Then she opened the shower door and saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying she was rude because people keep doors closed when occupied. She explained that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone's in there. She owns her house and pays her bills, so energy is a big deal for her. The roommate and her bf disagreed, said she was wrong for not understanding that two closed doors with a light off means someone's in there.\n\nHmm. The question is whether she's an asshole (A) or not (B). Let me break this down. First, did she do something wrong? Accidentally opening the door on someone in the shower is definitely an invasion of privacy. Even if it was a mistake, she did enter a space where someone was using it, which is a privacy issue. She did say sorry, so she acknowledged the mistake.\n\nNow, the roommate's reaction is that she was being rude because doors are closed when in use. She countered that in her household, doors were closed for energy efficiency. So, it's a cultural or situational norm difference. But in most contexts, especially in shared living spaces, people do close doors to maintain privacy. So even if she's used to a different reason for closing doors, in this case, the roommate expected that closed doors meant someone was in there. Her explanation is valid in her context, but the problem is that the roommate's expectation was violated. \n\nSo, she made a genuine mistake, but it's a mistake that led to privacy violation. The roommate's reaction is about respecting privacy, which is a valid concern. She apologized, but the roommate still felt hurt. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't intend to be rude, but her actions did invade privacy, maybe she is in the wrong. But some might argue that the roommate's expectations were different and she's just coming from a different background. But in shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is a common expectation. So even if her reasoning was energy efficiency, the result was an invasion of privacy. So maybe AITA? Or not?\n\nWait, but she didn't know the norm here. The problem is that in most places, closed doors do indicate someone is inside. So even if in her household it was for energy, the standard in many places is different. So she might be in the wrong because she should have been aware of the general norm. However, she might not be the asshole because she apologized and it was an accident. But the roommate felt disrespected. So the answer might depend on how strict the community's norms are. In some places, it's a big deal, in others less so. The question is whether she's in the wrong, not just if the roommate is being too sensitive. Since the roommate felt that doors indicate occupancy, and she didn't follow that norm, leading to the accident, she might be in the wrong. So answer A (yes, she's wrong). But maybe B if the mistake is excusable. Hmm. It's a tough one. I think the key is that in shared living situations, closed doors do usually mean someone's in there, so even if she had a different upbringing, she should have known that. So answer A.\n"
