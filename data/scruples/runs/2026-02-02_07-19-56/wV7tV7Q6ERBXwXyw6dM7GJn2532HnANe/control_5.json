This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she accidentally opened the door to her boyfriend's roommate's shower. She had headphones on, had to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, and then opened the shower door, saw light and steam, apologized, and walked off. The roommate made a big deal about common courtesy, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in there. She explained that in her family and because of energy efficiency, they keep doors closed even when not in use. The roommate and her boyfriend disagreed, and she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around bathroom door etiquette. In many cultures, a closed door with the light on usually means someone is inside. But the author's reasoning is that she was following energy-efficient practices, which is a valid point. However, the roommate's perspective is that the closed door with the light off might still indicate someone is in there, especially since the shower door was open and there was steam. The key here is that she opened the door without checking if someone was there. Even if her intention was energy efficiency, the act of opening the door without confirming if it's occupied is what caused the issue. \n\nShe did apologize, which is important, but the roommate felt disrespected. The question is whether her actions were wrong regardless of her intent. Some might say that regardless of reason, entering a room without confirming if someone is inside is a breach of privacy and common courtesy. Others might argue that she had a good reason and didn't intend to be rude. However, the roommate's reaction is based on his understanding of door etiquette. So, the author's mistake was not verifying the occupancy before entering. Even if the door was closed for energy reasons, she should have knocked or checked if someone was there before opening it. Therefore, she might be in the wrong because she didn't respect the roommate's expectations of privacy, even if her own intention was different. The answer would be A (Yes), she is in the wrong.\n"
