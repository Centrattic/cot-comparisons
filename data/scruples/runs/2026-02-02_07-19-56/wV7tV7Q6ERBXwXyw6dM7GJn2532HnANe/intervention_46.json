This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author opened the door to the bathroom and found their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. They had headphones on, were in a hurry to pee, and thought the door being closed but the light off meant the bathroom wasn't occupied. They opened the door, saw steam and a light, apologized, and closed the door. The roommate got upset, saying that closed doors and lights off don't indicate someone's in the bathroom. The author explained that in their large family, they locked doors for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. The roommate and the author's boyfriend thought the author was being rude and lacked common courtesy.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the understanding of social norms regarding bathroom doors and lights. The author believed that closed doors were for energy efficiency, while the roommate believed that closed doors (especially with the light off) indicated someone is inside. The author didn't mean to be rude and apologized, but the roommate took it as a violation of social etiquette.\n\nI need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The question is whether the author's understanding of the door's state was incorrect, leading to an accidental intrusion. The author's intention was innocent, but the action still caused discomfort. However, social norms can vary. In many places, a closed door with the light off does suggest someone is in the bathroom, but the author's explanation is that in their family, they used closed doors for energy reasons. So there's a cultural or upbringing difference here.\n\nThe roommate's reaction might be based on a different set of social norms. The author didn't check if the door was locked or if there was a sign (like a red dot or something) indicating someone is inside. Relying solely on the light being off might not be reliable. However, the author made a mistake but apologized. The roommate and boyfriend felt it was a breach of common courtesy.\n\nIn many Western cultures, it's common to assume that a closed bathroom door with the light off means someone is in there. So if the author didn't check for other signs (like a lock or a bathroom occupancy sign), they might be at fault for not following local norms. However, the author's explanation is that their family used closed doors for energy efficiency, which is a different context. But in most shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is a standard expectation, so maybe the author should have known better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent, apologized, and was trying to explain their reasoning. The roommate and boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the initial mistake was still a breach of privacy, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the author didn't mean to be rude, their action did invade the roommate's privacy, which is a breach of social norms in many contexts. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being aware of the local customs regarding bathroom door usage. However, the roommate's reaction could also be excessive. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because they made a mistake that caused discomfort, even if unintentionally.\n"
