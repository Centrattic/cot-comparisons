This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about accidentally opening the door to the shower when the roommate was in there. The author had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light off, then opened the shower door and found the roommate. They apologized, but the roommate was really upset about it, talking about common courtesy and door etiquette.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around door usage. In many places, a closed door typically means someone is using the bathroom, even if the light is off. Maybe the author's family had a different way of doing things, like keeping doors closed for energy efficiency. But in most social situations, a closed door is a sign to not enter, regardless of the light. So the author might be unaware of this norm, thinking it's just about energy, but the roommate and her boyfriend see it as a clear sign.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is good, but the roommate felt it was a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction is about personal space and privacy, which is a big deal. Even if it was a mistake, the act of opening the door without checking properly could have been avoided by knocking first or being more cautious. The author might not have intended to invade privacy, but the action still caused discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author explains their background and habits, which are valid. Energy efficiency is important, and their upbringing influenced their behavior. However, when living with others, adapting to their norms is usually necessary. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the principle of respecting others' privacy is a common standard that's hard to overlook.\n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to be rude, the action of entering without checking if someone's inside is a breach of social norms. The key here is that even if the reasoning is different, the impact on the roommate's privacy is significant. The author might not be the \"asshole,\" but they did make a mistake in not adhering to the expected social cues. The roommate's reaction is justified in terms of privacy, even if it's a cultural difference. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the implicit social signal of a closed door indicating someone is inside, despite their intentions.\n"
