This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author accidentally opened the door to their boyfriend's roommate's shower. The roommate was in there, and there was steam and light. The author said sorry and walked off. The roommate took it as a huge offense, talking about common courtesy and the doors being shut as an indication of occupation. The author explains that in their family, doors were kept shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone was using the bathroom. They live in a house where energy costs are a big deal. The roommate and boyfriend think the author is at fault because they didn't realize that two shut doors and a light off meant someone was in there. The author is confused and feels they apologized and that the issue is blown out of proportion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the cultural difference in interpreting door usage. The author comes from a background where doors are kept closed for energy reasons, not to signal occupancy. The roommate, however, assumes that closed doors mean someone is inside. The author made a mistake by opening the door without checking, even if they didn't realize the implications. But they did apologize and explain their reasoning.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intent and social norms. The author didn't have malicious intent, but they did make an error that affected someone else's privacy. However, their explanation shows a different background. The roommate's reaction seems harsh, but the author did acknowledge their mistake. Is the author at fault for not knowing a different social norm? Or is the roommate overreacting?\n\nIn many places, using the bathroom with the door closed is a common way to indicate it's occupied. The author's approach of closing doors for energy efficiency might not be as common elsewhere. However, even if the author didn't know, the act of opening the door without checking could be seen as a privacy violation. The author might be in the wrong for not being aware of the standard practice in their current environment, even if their own practice is different. But they did apologize, which is a positive step. The roommate's reaction is intense, but maybe they have a right to expect that doors are closed to mean occupied.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were considered disrespectful or just a misunderstanding. The author made a mistake but didn't intend harm. The roommate, however, felt their privacy was invaded. In social contexts, people often expect certain norms, even if they differ from what you're used to. So while the author isn't malicious, they might be in the wrong for not adhering to the local norm. But given the explanation and apology, maybe the roommate is overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the norm is that door closed = in use, then yes, they are at fault for not following that. But if the norm isn't universal, maybe they aren't. However, in shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is important. So the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
