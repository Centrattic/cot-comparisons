This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they went to check the shower part. They opened it and saw light and steam, realized the mistake, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about the intrusion, arguing that closed doors mean someone's in there. The author's reasoning is that in their family, doors are kept closed for energy efficiency, not privacy. The roommate and the boyfriend think the author was rude.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about differing social norms. The author's perspective is that closed doors aren't necessarily a sign that someone is inside (since they use them for energy), while the roommate's expectation is that a closed door means someone is using the space. The author's mistake was not recognizing that cultural norm in this particular context.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is a good step. But the key question is whether the author's actions were a violation of social etiquette in this scenario. In most cultures, a closed door, especially in a bathroom, is a strong indicator that someone is inside. The author's reasoning might be valid in their household, but when entering someone else's home, especially a roommate's situation, it's important to adapt to the local norms. The author might have been unaware of this cultural difference, but the consequence was a privacy breach, which the roommate found offensive.\n\nEven though the author didn't intend to be rude, the action did result in an invasion of privacy. The roommate's reaction is understandable because privacy is a significant concern for most people. The author's explanation about energy efficiency doesn't negate the social expectation that closed doors indicate occupancy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because they failed to respect the roommate's privacy by not recognizing the standard norm of closed doors meaning someone is in use.\n"
