This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, went to the shower area. When she opened it, there was light and steam, so she said sorry and left. The roommate was upset, saying she should have known that closed doors with light off don't mean someone's in there. The author explained that in her family, they kept doors shut for energy efficiency, hence the habit. The roommate and her boyfriend think she was rude because she didn't understand that two closed doors and a light off might not indicate occupation. \n\nHmm. So the main issue here is cultural or situational norms. The author grew up in a large household where keeping doors closed was for energy efficiency, so she didn't associate it with someone being in the room. The roommate, however, expected that if a door is closed and the light is off, it's occupied. That's a different interpretation of the same situation.\n\nThe author did apologize and admitted she was wrong to open the door. She didn't intend to be rude, just acted on her habit. The roommate, on the other hand, took it as a breach of common courtesy. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn most social contexts, a closed bathroom door would be considered a sign that someone is inside, especially if there's steam or light. But the author's background is different. However, she's living in a different environment now, sharing a space with people who have different expectations. Even if her intention was good, the result was an invasion of privacy. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't know the social norm in this new environment. But when you're in a shared living space, it's important to adapt to the norms of that space. The roommate's reaction is about maintaining privacy, which is a valid concern. The author's explanation is valid for her background, but she might need to adjust her behavior to fit the current living arrangements. \n\nSo, was she in the wrong? Well, she didn't mean to be rude, but she did invade someone's privacy. Even if it was a misunderstanding, the action was still a breach. So technically, she is in the wrong for opening the door without confirming it was unoccupied. However, the context of her background is a mitigating factor. But in the context of the shared living space, she should have been more cautious. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer leans towards A (Yes, she's in the wrong), because while her intent was not malicious, the action resulted in a privacy violation. The fact that she had a different upbringing doesn't absolve her of responsibility in the current situation where the norms are different. She could have knocked first or checked in another way. So yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
