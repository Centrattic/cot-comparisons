This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the bathroom door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The author apologizes and explains that in their family and due to energy efficiency, they keep doors closed even when not occupied. The roommate and the boyfriend think the author was rude and lacked common courtesy, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the cultural differences in door-closing habits and the immediate reaction. The author did apologize and admitted they were wrong, which is important. However, the roommate and the boyfriend argue that in their context, a closed door with the light off usually means someone is in the bathroom, so opening it was a breach of courtesy.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, many people do associate a closed bathroom door with someone being inside, even if the light is off. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid, but it's a situational norm. When living with others, especially in a shared space, it's important to adapt to the household's norms to avoid such incidents. The author did make a mistake and acknowledged it, but the roommate and boyfriend's reactions are based on their own expectations. \n\nThe author's explanation about their family's habits might explain their actions, but it doesn't negate the rudeness of the act itself. The roommate's reaction, while perhaps overly harsh, is rooted in the expectation of privacy. The author did invade that privacy accidentally, which is why the roommate was upset. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and take responsibility, which is a sign of good character. The question is whether the mistake itself is a significant enough error to be in the wrong. Since the author didn't intend to be rude and admitted fault, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But the act of opening the door without checking was a mistake, and the roommate's reaction is about respecting others' privacy, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn many social contexts, a closed bathroom door is a standard indicator of occupancy. The author might be from a different background where this isn't the norm, but in a shared living situation, adapting to local customs is necessary. So, even though the author was sorry, the action still caused an issue, making them partially at fault. But the question is if they are in the wrong. Since they didn't mean to be rude, maybe it's a B. But if the act itself is considered wrong regardless of intent, then A. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that the author made a mistake but took responsibility. The roommate's reaction is about privacy norms, which are important. The author's energy efficiency reason is valid but might not override the privacy expectation in a shared space. So the author might be in the wrong in the sense that they didn't follow the household's norms, but they apologized. However, in terms of being an asshole, maybe not. The answer might be B, but I'm a bit torn.\n"
