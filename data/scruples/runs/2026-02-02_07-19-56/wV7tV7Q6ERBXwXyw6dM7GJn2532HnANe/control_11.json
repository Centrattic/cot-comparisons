This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The key points here are the context and the interpretation of social norms.\n\nFirst, the person had headphones on, didn't mean to intrude, and thought the door being closed with the light off meant the bathroom was empty. They mentioned their family's practice of keeping doors closed for energy efficiency, which is a valid point. However, in many social norms, a closed door with the light on typically indicates someone is using the bathroom. The roommate felt it was a breach of privacy and rudeness, which is a common perspective. The person apologized, so intention wasn't malicious. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the person's actions did inadvertently invade privacy. The boyfriend and roommate's stance is that the person didn't follow the social standard, hence the conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. While their intention was innocent, the outcome did cause an invasion of privacy. Even if the reasoning for keeping doors closed differs, the social expectation in many contexts is that a closed bathroom door (especially with steam and light) is a private space. So, the person made a mistake, but it's a matter of differing social norms. However, the mistake was accidental and they apologized. The roommate's reaction is harsh, but the person's actions did lead to the situation. Therefore, the person isn't entirely in the wrong, but the roommate's perspective is valid. The answer here is B (No), because the person didn't act with malice and the misunderstanding comes from cultural differences in norms, not being inherently wrong.\n"
