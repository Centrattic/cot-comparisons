This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they accidentally opened the door to their boyfriend's roommate's shower. The author had headphones on, saw the bathroom door closed with the light off, then went to the shower part (maybe a separate door or a partition?), saw light and steam, and said sorry. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate someone is using the bathroom. The author's defense is that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. The roommate and boyfriend think the author was rude and lacked common courtesy.\n\nFirst, the key points: Did the author have a reasonable expectation of whether the door being closed meant someone was in there? The roommate's argument is that two closed doors and a light off mean someone is in the bathroom. But the author's experience was different. So maybe the cultural norm varies. The author didn't mean to be rude, just made a mistake based on their own habits.\n\nBut when in doubt, it's better to check if someone is in there. The author opened the door without confirming, which led to an awkward situation. Even if the reason for keeping doors closed was different, the action of opening the door without checking could be seen as a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the action itself was inappropriate regardless of intent. The author did apologize, which is good, but the question is whether they were wrong in the first place. Since the roommate's perspective is valid (in many places, a closed door implies someone is using it), the author's assumption might not be the norm in this new environment. So the author is at least partially at fault for not checking and assuming the door was closed for another reason. However, the roommate's response could be disproportionate. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Based on common social norms, entering a closed door without checking could be considered a breach of privacy, so the author is in the wrong, but the roommate's reaction might be too harsh. The answer is A (Yes), but with some nuance.\n"
