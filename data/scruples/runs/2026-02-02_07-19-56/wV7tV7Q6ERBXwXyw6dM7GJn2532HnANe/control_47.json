This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally walked into the boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The key points here are the sequence of events and cultural norms regarding bathroom door usage.\n\nThe author had headphones on, was in a rush to use the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light off, then opened the shower part and saw light and steam. She apologized but the roommate was upset. The main issue is whether closing the door with the light off is an indication that the bathroom is occupied. The author explains that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and her boyfriend argue that closed doors mean someone is in there, hence her being rude.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author made a mistake. Accidentally opening the door on someone in the shower is definitely a privacy breach, so she's at fault there. However, her reasoning is based on her upbringing and energy concerns. The roommate's expectation is different, interpreting closed doors as occupied. Both sides have valid points based on their experiences. But the main question is if the author is wrong. Since she admitted her mistake, apologized, and it was an accident, maybe she's not the asshole. But the act itself caused a privacy issue. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The roommate's perspective is valid too. Maybe the answer is A because she was wrong to open the door despite the intentions, but her explanation shows a lack of awareness of different norms. But in the end, she's not the asshole because it was an accident and she apologized. Wait, the AITA template usually considers intent. Since she didn't mean to intrude, maybe B. But the act itself is wrong regardless of intent. I'm a bit torn here. The roommate's reaction is harsh, but the author did make a mistake. I think the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't check properly, but maybe B because it was a cultural misunderstanding. Wait, the roommate's side says that two shut doors and light off mean someone is there. She opened the door even though the light was off. The first door was closed but light off, then she opened the shower part. If the light was off, maybe that's a sign it's not in use. But her reasoning is that they keep doors closed for energy, so the light being off doesn't mean empty. The roommate's expectation is different. So she didn't check if anyone was in there. She's in the wrong because she didn't ensure the room was empty before opening the door. So answer A.\n"
