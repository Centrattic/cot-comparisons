This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on, had to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but light off, went to the shower part (which was closed but had light and steam). They opened it, saw the roommate, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that if doors are closed and the light is off, it means the room is unoccupied. The author's reasoning is that in their family of eight, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone was in there. The roommate and the boyfriend think the author was rude and lacking common courtesy, hence the argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are about social norms versus personal habits. The author's action was a mistake because they didn't realize the cultural norm (closed door with light off might mean it's free, but in reality, people might close the door for privacy when using the bathroom). However, the author apologized and didn't mean to do it. The roommate, on the other hand, is taking it as a personal offense about common courtesy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of intent, the author didn't mean to invade privacy; they had a different habit. But in social situations, the norm is usually that a closed door with a light on or off could indicate someone is inside, especially if there's steam or light. The author's mistake was not recognizing that norm, but they did apologize. However, the mistake led to invading someone's privacy, which is a big deal. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They made an honest error in judgment based on their upbringing. However, privacy is a societal expectation, and even if you didn't mean to, opening a door without checking properly can be seen as a breach of that trust. The roommate's reaction is about feeling disrespected, and the boyfriend's support for the roommate suggests that the social norm is on the roommate's side.\n\nBut the author did apologize and explained their reasoning. The key here is whether the mistake was a one-time thing and whether the author is open to learning from it. The roommate's reaction seems harsh, but the act of opening the door on someone in the shower is a privacy violation, regardless of intent. However, if the author honestly didn't know the norm and apologized, it's not necessarily their fault, but they did cause an issue. \n\nIn many cultures, a closed bathroom door usually indicates that someone is inside, especially if there's steam or the light is on. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid, but in this specific scenario, they misinterpreted the social cues. So, while the author didn't mean to be rude, the action still violated the roommate's privacy. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not being aware of the standard social expectation in that situation, even if they had a different upbringing. The mistake was understandable, but the consequence was significant, so the author is in the wrong to some extent. However, since they apologized and explained their reasoning, the severity might be less. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer is a bit nuanced, but in terms of the scenario presented, the author made a mistake that caused privacy violation, so they are in the wrong.\n"
