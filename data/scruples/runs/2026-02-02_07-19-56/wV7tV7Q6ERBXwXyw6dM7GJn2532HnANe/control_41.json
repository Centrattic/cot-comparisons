This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who accidentally walked in on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower while using the bathroom is in the wrong. The person apologized, explained their reasoning about energy efficiency, and the roommate and boyfriend took it as a personal slight. \n\nFirst, the situation is an accidental intrusion. The person had headphones on, noticed the first bathroom door was closed with the light off, then went to the shower door which had light and steam. They opened it, realized the mistake, apologized, and left. The roommate, however, made a big deal about it, insisting that closed doors with lights off are a sign someone is inside. The person's defense is that in their family, doors are kept closed for energy efficiency, not privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and cultural norms. The person didn't mean to barge in; it was a mistake. They apologized immediately. The roommate's reaction seems harsh because the door was closed, but the light was on, which could be a more reliable indicator. However, the person's family trained them to close doors for energy, which is different from the norm in the roommate's perspective. \n\nNow, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. Since the action was accidental and they apologized, the mistake itself isn't malicious. However, the roommate's perspective is valid because in many places, a closed door with the light off might be taken as a sign someone is inside. The person's explanation about energy efficiency is a good point, but maybe they should have been more aware of the local norms, especially since they live together. \n\nBut the roommate's reaction seems over the top. The person admitted fault, apologized, and the mistake was unintentional. The roommate's insistence on \"common courtesy\" might be more about personal standards than actual wrongdoing. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might not fully understand the context of the person's upbringing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while closing doors for privacy is common, the person's energy-saving approach isn't inherently wrong. However, in shared living spaces, adapting to household norms is often necessary. The person might have been too rigid in their habits, but the mistake was minor and addressed immediately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong because the action was accidental and they took responsibility. The roommate's reaction is more about differing expectations than actual malice from the person. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
