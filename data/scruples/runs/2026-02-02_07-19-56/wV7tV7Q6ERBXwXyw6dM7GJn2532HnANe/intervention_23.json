This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The situation is that the author had headphones on, went to the bathroom, noticed the first door was shut but the light was off, and then opened the shower door. She saw light and steam and apologized. The roommate was upset, arguing that doors being closed mean someone is in there, and he felt she was being rude. The author's defense is that in her family, doors were kept closed for energy efficiency, not as a sign of being occupied. Her boyfriend and his roommate thought she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, a closed bathroom door is generally interpreted as a sign that someone is inside, especially if there's steam or light showing. The author's reasoning is about energy efficiency, which is a valid point, but maybe not the social norm. The roommate's reaction is based on the expectation that closed doors mean someone is in there. The author might not have known that, but it's a common enough understanding that she might be expected to follow it.\n\nThe author did apologize, so she took responsibility. However, the mistake was about not understanding the social cue. The question is whether not knowing this norm makes her at fault. In some cases, people can be ignorant of local customs, but basic etiquette like this is pretty standard. So maybe she is at least partially in the wrong. But then again, if her background is different, maybe she's not. The roommate's reaction seems a bit overblown, but his perspective is that it's about common courtesy. The key point is whether the author should have known that a closed door indicates someone is in the bathroom. If that's a widely accepted norm, then she is in the wrong. If it's a regional or cultural difference, maybe not. The author's explanation is valid, but the outcome is that the roommate felt violated. So the answer might hinge on whether the norm is universal enough. I think in most cases, a closed bathroom door is a standard indicator, so the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
