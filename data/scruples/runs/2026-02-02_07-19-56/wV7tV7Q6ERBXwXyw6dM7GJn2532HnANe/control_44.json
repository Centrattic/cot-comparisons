This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accidentally opened their boyfriend's roommate's door while he was in the shower. The key points here are the context and the reactions.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. The first door was shut but the light was off, so they assumed it was safe to open the shower door. They saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is using the bathroom. The author explained that in their family, doors are kept closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend and roommate agreed the author was wrong, but the author feels it's a cultural difference.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let me break it down. The roommates had a different expectation: closed doors mean someone is in there. The author's practice was based on energy efficiency, which led to a misunderstanding. The author apologized and didn't mean to be rude. The roommate, however, felt disrespected because the norm in their experience was different.\n\nIn terms of social norms, in many places, a closed door (especially with light on) does signal that someone is using the bathroom. The author's approach might be less common in shared living situations where privacy is a concern. But the author's intention wasn't malicious, just a habit from their upbringing. The roommate's reaction is about privacy, which is valid. However, the author didn't intend to intrude, just made a mistake.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? They did make an error in judgment based on different habits, but they apologized and acknowledged the mistake. The roommate's reaction is about differing expectations. The author isn't being inconsiderate if it's a genuine misunderstanding and they're open to changing their habits. However, the act of opening the door without checking, even accidentally, could be seen as a breach of privacy. In shared spaces, following the group's norms is usually expected once you're aware of them. The author might not be in the wrong if they're adapting, but there's a balance between personal habits and respecting others' expectations.\n\nGiven that the author is now aware of the roommate's norms and is willing to adjust, maybe the answer leans towards B (not at fault). But the initial action did invade privacy, so some might say A. Hmm. This is tricky. The key is the intent vs. the impact. The author didn't intend to be rude, but the action had an impact. But since they apologized and are trying to understand, maybe it's not their fault. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific living agreement. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the author apologized and is making an effort to adjust, the answer is B.\n"
