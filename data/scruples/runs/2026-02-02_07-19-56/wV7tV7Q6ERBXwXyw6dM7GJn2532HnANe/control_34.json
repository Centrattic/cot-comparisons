This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower.\n\nSo the situation is that the author heard she had to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, and went to the shower part. The bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so she assumed the shower room might not be occupied. When she opened the door, she saw steam and light and apologized and left. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying that closed doors mean someone is using the bathroom, and she was being rude by not respecting that. She explained that in her family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone's inside. Her boyfriend agreed with the roommate, and she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the expectations around bathroom door usage. In many households, especially in the US, people often keep bathroom doors closed when using the toilet or shower for privacy. The idea is that if the door is closed, someone is inside. However, in some cases, especially in older homes or certain cultures, doors might be left open. But the key here is that the person entering the bathroom should check if someone is inside. The author closed the bathroom door but the light was off. However, the shower room is a separate part, and she didn't check that the shower was unoccupied. She just assumed because the main bathroom door was closed but light was off, the shower part was okay. That's where the mistake happened.\n\nThe roommate's point is that the closed door (and maybe the shower door) would indicate someone is using it. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency is a different cultural norm. But in most places, when you enter a bathroom, you check if someone is inside. Closing the door is both for privacy and to prevent others from entering. The fact that she opened the shower door without checking if someone was there is the issue. Even if her intention was to save energy, the consequence was invading someone's privacy. \n\nShe did apologize, which is good, but the roommate might feel that the action itself was a breach of privacy, regardless of intent. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might be because he's in the same cultural context where closed doors indicate someone is using the bathroom. So the author's actions, while perhaps unintentional, still caused an invasion of privacy, making her at least partially responsible. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the roommate overreacted, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. If the cultural norm in the roommate's context is that closed doors mean someone is in there, then the author not following that norm could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she didn't check the shower door specifically is a mistake. So the answer might lean towards AITA, making her the asshole. But some might argue that it's a misunderstanding of cultural norms. However, since the roommate's perspective is valid, the author's action, while not malicious, was still a breach of privacy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
