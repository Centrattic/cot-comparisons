This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The person says they had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, then opened the shower part and saw light and steam. They apologized and left, but the roommate was upset about common courtesy, saying closed doors indicate someone is in there. The person argues that in their large family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and the boyfriend both think they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about assumptions and cultural norms. The person's background is in a big household where closing doors was for energy efficiency, so they didn't associate closed doors with someone using the bathroom. But the roommate's expectation was that closed doors mean someone is inside. The person made a mistake by opening the door, but they apologized. The question is whether that makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nIn terms of social norms, in many places, a closed door with the light on usually indicates someone is in the room. However, the person had a different upbringing. The mistake was accidental, but they did correct their action by apologizing. The roommate, on the other hand, escalated the situation by making a big deal out of it. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might be influenced by the roommate's perspective. \n\nBut the person did make an error, albeit unintentionally. Even if their reasoning is valid, the action led to an invasion of privacy. The roommate's reaction is about respecting boundaries, which is valid. However, the person's explanation shows they weren't being malicious. The main issue is whether the mistake, despite good intentions, makes them at fault. Since they apologized and took responsibility, maybe the roommate overreacted. But the act itself was a privacy violation, so the person is partly at fault. However, considering the context of different upbringings, maybe not entirely. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The person wasn't trying to be rude, but they did accidentally invade privacy. The roommate's reaction is about respecting boundaries, which is important. However, the person's explanation shows a lack of awareness of a common norm. So, is the person in the wrong? Maybe partially, but not entirely. The answer depends on whether you prioritize intent or the consequence. Since they apologized and admitted fault, maybe they aren't the asshole. But the action itself was a mistake. So leaning towards answer B (not in the wrong) because the mistake was accidental and they took responsibility, but the context of different norms plays a role. However, there's a counterargument that they should have known better. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the person's intention wasn't malicious and they corrected their mistake, so they aren't the asshole. The roommate's overreaction is part of the issue. So answer B.\n"
