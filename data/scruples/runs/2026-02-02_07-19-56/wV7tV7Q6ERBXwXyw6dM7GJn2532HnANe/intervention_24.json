This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The key points here are the context and the reactions.\n\nFirst, the author had to use the bathroom, noticed the first door was shut with the light off, and proceeded to open the shower door. They saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, thinking that closed doors with lights off indicate the room is occupied. The author's explanation is that in their family of eight, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and the author's boyfriend disagreed, saying that common courtesy dictates closed doors mean someone is in there.\n\nSo, the core issue is differing cultural or social norms. The author's background led them to close doors for energy reasons, but the roommate interpreted it as a sign the room was in use. The author did apologize and acknowledged the mistake, but the roommate still felt it was a breach of courtesy.\n\nIn many social contexts, a closed door with the light on might indicate someone is inside, but there's no universal rule. The roommate's perspective is based on his own understanding, while the author's is shaped by their upbringing. The author didn't mean to be rude and corrected their mistake immediately. However, the roommate's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is valid in his eyes. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? They made an honest mistake, apologized, and took responsibility. The problem arises from differing expectations. In such cases, it's about perspective. While the author's intention wasn't malicious, the action did cause discomfort. The roommate's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a matter of differing norms. \n\nHowever, in most social standards, a closed door with someone inside (even if the light is off) is expected to be respected. The author opened the door without checking if the room was occupied, which is a standard practice. Even if the door was closed for energy reasons, once in the room, the author assumed it was empty and proceeded to open another door, leading to the incident. \n\nSo, while the author's explanation is valid, the action itself\u2014entering a room without confirming if someone is inside\u2014is where the mistake lies. The author should have checked for occupancy signs beyond the door's position. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just whether their explanation is valid. Given that they did enter the room and caused an issue, even if unintentionally, they might share some responsibility.\n"
