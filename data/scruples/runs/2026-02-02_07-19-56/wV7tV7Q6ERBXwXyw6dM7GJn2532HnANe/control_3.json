This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author accidentally opened the door to their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. They had headphones on, the bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they assumed it was okay to open the door. When they saw light and steam, they apologized and left. The roommate, however, was upset and made a big deal about it, saying that closed doors with the light off indicate someone is in there. The author explained that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, and they were sorry. The roommate and the boyfriend agreed that the author was in the wrong and that they \"lost\" the argument. The author is confused and thinks maybe they're just ignorant of a different standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, a closed door with the light off might not necessarily mean someone is in the bathroom. However, in some contexts, people might leave the door closed but the light on when in use. The author's explanation is that their family kept doors closed for energy reasons, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and boyfriend argue that the author should have known better. \n\nThe key points here are intent and common expectations. The author didn't mean to be rude, apologized, and acknowledged their mistake. However, the situation involved invading someone's privacy, even if accidentally. The roommate's reaction might be about privacy concerns. In most social settings, people expect that if they're in the bathroom, others would knock or check if someone's in there. The author didn't do that, leading to an accidental invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, their action did result in a privacy breach. The roommate's reaction, while possibly over the top, is about respecting personal space. The author's explanation about energy efficiency might not be a widely accepted norm in all contexts, so maybe the author is out of step with common practices in this situation. \n\nTherefore, the author is partially at fault for not being aware of the standard expectation that a closed door with the light off might not be an indicator, and perhaps not knocking before entering. However, it's a common mistake. The main issue is the privacy aspect, so the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer would be A (Yes) because the author's actions, while not intentional, did result in a breach of privacy and they didn't take the necessary precautions, even if they apologized.\n"
