This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally walking in on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, and thought the door was closed but the light was off. They opened the shower door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in the bathroom. The author explained that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. The roommate and the boyfriend took it as a lack of common courtesy, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual social norms. Typically, a closed door with the light off might be taken as a sign that the bathroom is occupied. If the light is on, people might assume someone is using the bathroom. But the author saw the light off, so maybe they didn't realize that the light being off doesn't always mean it's empty. However, the roommate was in the shower, so the light would likely be on inside the bathroom, even if the main room's light is off. Wait, the author mentions that the first door (to the bathroom) was shut but the light was off. Then they opened the shower door and saw light and steam. So maybe the bathroom door was closed, but the bathroom light was off, but the shower area had a light on. Hmm, maybe the bathroom has two doors? Like one to the main bathroom and then another to the shower? Not sure about the setup here.\n\nThe key point is about understanding social cues. The roommate expected that if a door is closed, especially the bathroom door, it's occupied. The author's explanation is that they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, which is a valid reason, but in this case, the roommate interpreted it as the bathroom being empty. The author's mistake was not recognizing that the closed door (even with the light off) might indicate someone is inside. The roommate's reaction is about privacy, which is a common concern in shared living spaces. The author did apologize and didn't mean to intrude, but the action was still a mistake. However, the roommate's overreaction might stem from a misunderstanding of the author's intention. The author wasn't being rude on purpose, but they made an error in judgment. The question is whether this makes them the asshole. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally expect that closed doors mean the room is occupied, especially in shared spaces. Even if the light is off, it's possible that someone is still using the bathroom (e.g., in the shower, so the light is off in the main bathroom but the shower area has light). The author's approach of checking the door's status (closed vs. open) and the light is a common method. But in this case, the author misread the signs. However, the roommate's reaction might be overly harsh, especially since the author immediately apologized and didn't act out of malice. The boyfriend's agreement with the roommate suggests that the author's action was indeed a mistake, but the roommate's response might be excessive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a mistake, but not out of ill intent. The roommate's reaction is about privacy, which is valid. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a reasonable practice, but it doesn't override the social norm of using closed doors to indicate occupancy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the mistake, but the roommate might have overreacted. However, according to the question, we need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Since they did make a mistake that invaded someone's privacy, even accidentally, the answer would be A (Yes). But some might argue that it's a social norm misunderstanding, not malicious intent, so maybe B (No). But usually, in such cases, the person who accidentally invades privacy is considered at fault, even if unintentional. So the answer is A.\n"
