This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had headphones on and was in a hurry to pee. They noticed the bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they opened the shower part and saw light and steam. They said sorry and left. The roommate was upset, insisting that closed doors (with the light off) indicate someone is in there. The author explained their family's energy-saving practices involved keeping doors closed even when not in use. The boyfriend and roommate agreed she was wrong, but she felt it's a cultural difference.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she did open the door without checking if someone was in the shower. But the reason was because of her energy habits. However, the main issue is that she didn't realize the closed door with the light off might signal that the bathroom is occupied. While her intention wasn't to be rude, the action did invade someone's privacy. Even if her reasoning was about energy efficiency, the standard in many places is that a closed door with the light on means someone is inside. She didn't check the light or the door to see if it was occupied. The key here is that she made an assumption based on her personal habits, which led to a breach of privacy. So, even though she apologized and had good intentions, the action itself was a mistake. The roommate's reaction is about privacy expectations, which are common in many social contexts. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't follow the usual social cues indicating someone was in the bathroom.\n"
