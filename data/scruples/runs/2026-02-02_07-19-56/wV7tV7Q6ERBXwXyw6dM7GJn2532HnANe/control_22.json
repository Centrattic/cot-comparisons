This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The situation is that the author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, went to the shower door (which was closed), and when she opened it, saw light and steam. She apologized and left. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate someone's in there. The author explains that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, and that's why she didn't realize the closed door meant someone was in there. Her boyfriend and the roommate agreed she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the common understanding of door etiquette. In many cultures, a closed bathroom door typically means someone is inside. However, the author's defense is that in her household, doors were closed for energy reasons, not to indicate someone's presence. That might be a cultural or household-specific norm. The problem arises when she misinterpreted the closed door (with the light off) as not being occupied, leading to an accidental intrusion.\n\nThe key points here are intention and understanding. The author didn't mean to be rude, apologized, and learned from the mistake. However, the roommate and her boyfriend argue that the standard expectation is that a closed bathroom door means someone is inside. The author's explanation is valid in her context, but she was in a different household with different norms.\n\nIn most social settings, people assume that a closed bathroom door with the light off is unoccupied, but that's not universally true. However, there's also a general expectation that one checks if a room is occupied before entering, especially for bathroom doors. The fact that she opened the shower door without checking if someone was inside (even if the bathroom door was closed) might be seen as an oversight. But the roommate's reaction seems harsh, especially since she apologized immediately and there was no malicious intent.\n\nThe author admitted fault and took responsibility, which is important. The roommate's insistence on the argument might be more about the principle than the actual incident. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate could indicate that he's prioritizing his roommate's feelings over her explanation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while there can be variations, the majority of people do interpret closed bathroom doors as occupied. The author's energy-saving rationale is a personal household norm, but when moving into a shared space, adapting to local norms is usually expected. However, the mistake was accidental, and she took immediate corrective action. The roommate's reaction being overly harsh could be a factor here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make an error in judgment by not checking if someone was in the shower, given the norm in most places. But her intent was not malicious, and she apologized. The roommate's overreaction might be part of the issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she did accidentally intrude, even if unintentionally, she is technically in the wrong, but maybe not in a malicious way. The answer might lean towards A (she is in the wrong) but with context that the mistake was minor and there was no ill intent. However, the social norm here is that a closed bathroom door (especially with a light off) is unoccupied, but the shower door being closed might be a different consideration. Wait, the author opened the shower door, which was closed, but the bathroom door was closed. So maybe the roommate was in the shower, and the bathroom door was closed, but the shower was inside. The author opened the shower door, which was closed but the bathroom door was closed. Hmm, maybe the confusion is because the bathroom door being closed and the light off made her think the bathroom was unoccupied, but the shower was still in use. So, perhaps the roommate was in the shower, but the bathroom door was closed (light off), leading the author to think the bathroom was empty. She then opened the shower door, which was closed, but the shower was occupied. In that case, the author's mistake was in assuming the bathroom was unoccupied because the light was off, not because the shower door was closed. So the norm about closed bathroom doors indicating occupancy might not be as clear as the roommate thinks. Different people might have different practices. The author's approach is based on energy efficiency, which is a valid reason, but in a shared space, maybe the norm is different. However, the author didn't know that ahead of time. So the mistake was in not checking the bathroom's occupancy before entering, even if she thought the door was closed for energy reasons. The key is that she didn't check if someone was in the shower despite the closed door. So, she is in the wrong for not verifying, but it's a minor mistake. The roommate's reaction being extreme might be part of the problem, but the author did make an error in judgment. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but with context that the mistake was minor and unintentional.\n"
