This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about accidentally opening the bathroom door and seeing the boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The author has headphones on, the bathroom door was shut but the light was off, so she assumed it was empty. When she opened the door, she saw steam and light, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with the light off indicate someone is in there, and the boyfriend agreed with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around bathroom door etiquette. In many shared living situations, people do use the state of the door (open or closed) and the light to determine if the bathroom is occupied. If the door is closed but the light is off, some might think it's unoccupied, especially if they're used to locking doors for other reasons like energy efficiency. However, others might interpret a closed door and light as a sign someone is inside, using the light to signal occupancy. The author's explanation is that in her family of eight, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate use. \n\nNow, the roommate and the boyfriend's reaction is about common courtesy, suggesting that assuming a closed door (with the light off) is unoccupied is rude because it's a standard sign that someone is in there. The author apologized but the roommate continued to be upset, leading to the question of whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the key points here are about differing standards and expectations. The author didn't intend to be rude and did apologize, but the roommate took it as a violation of a norm he expected. The question is whether the author's action was indeed a breach of common etiquette or if the roommate was being overly sensitive. \n\nIn many places, especially in Western cultures, it's common to knock on a closed door before entering, regardless of the light, because a closed door often signifies privacy. However, the light being off might make someone think it's not in use. But the roommate might have left the light off for a different reason, like saving energy or the lightbulb was out. The author's assumption might be based on her past experience where doors were closed for energy efficiency, but in a different context, people use the door's state as a privacy indicator.\n\nSo, the author made a mistake by not checking if the door was locked or knocking first. Even if the light was off, a closed door could still mean someone is in there. While her intention wasn't to be rude, the action did result in an invasion of privacy, which is a valid concern for the roommate. The roommate's reaction is about respecting privacy, which is generally a higher priority than energy efficiency. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't follow the usual etiquette of checking if the door is locked or knocking. However, it's also a matter of differing expectations. But in most shared living situations, respecting privacy by not entering a closed door without checking is standard. So the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong, but maybe not as an asshole, just a mistake in etiquette.\n"
