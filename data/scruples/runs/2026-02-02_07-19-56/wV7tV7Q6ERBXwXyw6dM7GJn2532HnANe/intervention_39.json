This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door to find their boyfriend's roommate in the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had headphones on and needed to go to the bathroom. The first door was closed and the light was off, so they assumed the bathroom was empty. But the shower door was closed, and maybe they didn't realize that the main bathroom door was closed while the shower door was. When they opened the door, they saw light and steam and immediately apologized. The roommate was upset, thinking that closed doors and the light off usually indicate the bathroom is unoccupied. The author comes from a big family where doors were kept closed for energy efficiency, so they didn't associate closed doors with someone being inside. The boyfriend and roommate both thought the author was being rude and the author lost the argument, even though they were just trying to explain their reasoning.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about assumptions and social norms. In most places, especially in a shared living situation, people might expect that a closed door with the light on means someone is in there. But the author's background was different\u2014locking doors for energy efficiency, not privacy. The roommate and boyfriend are upset because the author didn't follow what they consider a common courtesy. The author apologized and admitted they were wrong in opening the door, but their reasoning was based on their upbringing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Accidentally walking in is not malicious, but they did make a mistake in the assumption. The question is whether that assumption is a reasonable one. In many cultures, closed doors with the light on do suggest someone is inside, so the author's approach of keeping doors closed regardless of occupation might not align with typical expectations. However, the author's intention was not to be intrusive. The roommate overreacted by making a big deal out of an accident, but the author's action did invade privacy unintentionally. \n\nThe author is from a different background where the purpose of closing doors was different. This could be a cultural or generational difference. Even so, in a shared space, it's important to adapt to the norms of that environment. The author's habit of closing doors for energy reasons might be confusing to others who use door status as a privacy indicator. So, while the author didn't mean to be rude, their action still caused an invasion of privacy, even if accidental. The roommate and boyfriend's reaction is about the norm in their current living situation, so the author's mistake might be a result of not adapting to those norms. \n\nTherefore, the author is not entirely in the wrong because it was an accident, and they apologized. However, in the context of shared living, they might be expected to follow the prevailing norms. But the main issue is whether the door's state (closed with light off) is a standard indicator. The author's explanation is valid, but if the roommates have a different understanding, the author could be seen as having a misunderstanding of the social cues here. \n\nWait, the author said the first door was closed, but the light was off. Maybe the bathroom has two doors: the main entrance and the shower area. If the main door is closed and the light is off, the author thought it was unoccupied. But the roommate was in the shower, which is a private space. So perhaps the author didn't check properly or made a wrong assumption. Even if the habit was for energy efficiency, the social norm in this case is that closed doors with light off might still be occupied (like in a shower with steam). The author's mistake was not verifying if the bathroom was in use, possibly by knocking or checking the door. So the author is in the wrong because their action, though accidental, didn't account for possible privacy indicators. The roommate's reaction is about the breach of privacy, which is a valid concern. The author's explanation isn't an excuse but an explanation. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, and the question is to determine if that's the case. The answer would be A, but I need to be sure. The main issue is the expectation of privacy. If the bathroom's doors (main and shower) are closed, but the light is off, maybe the steam and light inside the shower area could be a sign. However, if the main light is off, maybe the author thought the room was unoccupied. But in reality, the shower area might have a separate light. The key is that the author didn't confirm whether the bathroom was in use, so regardless of the reason, they made a privacy error. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). The roommate's reaction is justified because privacy in shared spaces is important, and the author's explanation doesn't negate the breach.\n"
