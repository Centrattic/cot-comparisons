This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author had their headphones on and needed to go to the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they opened the part leading to the shower. They saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate then made a big deal about common courtesy, saying that if a door is closed, it's an indication that someone's inside. The author explained that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not because someone was using the room. The author apologized, but the roommate and her boyfriend didn't accept it, thinking she's rude and that she lost the argument. The author is confused because they didn't mean to be rude and think it's not as common a standard as they claim.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about cultural norms and assumptions. The author's background is in a large family where closing doors was for energy efficiency and not necessarily to indicate privacy. The roommate, on the other hand, assumes that a closed door and a light off means the room is unoccupied, so when the author opened the shower door without checking, it led to an awkward situation.\n\nFirst, did the author do something wrong? Well, the roommate clearly felt that the author violated a norm by not respecting the closed door as a sign that the bathroom was occupied. In many cultures and living situations, a closed door (especially if the light is on or there's steam) is a clear indicator that someone is in there. The author might not have been aware of this, but the roommate and her bf likely see it as a breach of privacy and courtesy.\n\nThe author's defense is based on their upbringing, where doors were closed for energy reasons. However, the roommate's experience is that a closed door signifies privacy. The problem here is the clash of different cultural norms. The author's action, while unintentional, still caused an invasion of privacy. The roommate's reaction is understandable because they expected the door to be a sign of being in use, and the author didn't check. The author did apologize, but the roommate might feel that the explanation is after the fact and doesn't mitigate the mistake.\n\nThe author's boyfriend agreeing with the roommate's view suggests that the author's reasoning isn't widely accepted in the current context. The author might be right that not everyone follows this norm, but in shared living spaces, respecting the roommate's expectations is important. The author should have knocked or checked if someone was in the bathroom, regardless of their personal habits. So even if the action was accidental, the lack of checking could be seen as a failure to respect the roommate's privacy, making the author at least partially at fault.\n"
