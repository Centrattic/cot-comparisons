This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for accidentally opening the door to their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The key points are: they had headphones on, the bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they opened the door to the shower, saw light and steam, and apologized.\n\nThe roommate took offense, saying that closed doors with the light off indicate someone is in the shower. The author explains that in their family, doors were kept closed for energy efficiency, not privacy, and that they lock doors for that reason. The roommate and boyfriend thought the author was being rude and lacked common courtesy.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, accidentally opening the door to someone in the shower is definitely a privacy issue. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the action violated the roommate's privacy. Apologizing is important, but the initial mistake was unintentional. However, the author's explanation about energy efficiency might be valid in their context, but in many places, especially in shared living situations, a closed door with the light on is a clear sign someone is using the bathroom. The author's reasoning for keeping doors closed might not align with others' expectations of privacy signals.\n\nThe roommate and boyfriend's reactions are based on common social norms where a closed door with the light on means someone is inside. The author's approach of closing doors for energy reasons might not be as common or understood by others, leading to misunderstandings. Even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the action still caused an invasion of privacy, so there might be some accountability there. However, the author did apologize and was sincere, which shows they recognize the mistake. The debate is whether the mistake was due to ignorance of social norms or a genuine difference in upbringing. \n\nIn shared spaces, it's generally expected that closed doors with the light on indicate someone is inside. The author's explanation is valid in their family context, but in a different environment, social norms can vary. The key is whether the author should have been aware of the roommate's expectations. Since they were in a shared living situation, they might be expected to follow the norms of that environment rather than their own. So, the author's mistake was not following the social cue that a closed door with the light on means someone is using the bathroom. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they disregarded the social norm, even if unintentionally. But there's also a cultural or contextual aspect where the author's habits are based on energy efficiency. However, in most shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is a fundamental expectation, so the author might have overstepped despite their intentions.\n"
