This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author accidentally walked into their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The key points here are the context and what each person expects.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they had headphones on and were in a hurry to pee. They saw the bathroom door closed but the light was off, so they assumed it wasn't occupied. Then they opened the shower part and saw light and steam, realized the mistake, apologized, and left. The roommate, however, was upset and thought the author was being rude by locking doors to save energy, implying that closed doors (even with lights off) mean someone is in there. The author's BF and the roommate agreed that the author was wrong for not knowing this social norm.\n\nSo, the main issue is about conflicting expectations. In some households, closed doors are for privacy, and if the light is off, maybe it's not occupied. But in others, even if the light is off, a closed door means someone is in there. The author's explanation is that in their family of eight, they closed doors for energy efficiency, especially in cold weather. They own a house and pay their own bills, so energy efficiency is important to them. The roommate and BF think the author should have known that closed doors indicate occupation, hence common courtesy.\n\nNow, considering common social norms: typically, a closed door with the light on or steam (as in a shower) might indicate someone is inside. However, if the light is off, maybe people might check? But the author didn't check, just went in. However, the author claims they didn't realize the door closed means someone is in there. The roommate, on the other hand, thinks that's a basic understanding. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author did apologize and acknowledged their mistake. The issue is more about differing cultural norms. In some places, closed doors for privacy are the norm, while in others, it's for energy. The roommate and BF see the author as rude for not adhering to the privacy norm. But the author is following their own learned behavior from their family. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they made a mistake by not checking if the room was occupied, but they had a valid reason based on their upbringing. The roommate and BF might be right in their perspective, but the author isn't malicious. The key is whether the mistake was a failure to understand a social norm. Since the author didn't intend to be rude and apologized, maybe they aren't the asshole. However, in the roommate's view, the norm is different, so the author is at fault for not knowing. \n\nIn some cases, when entering a bathroom, you might knock or check if there's steam or light. The author saw steam and light when they opened the door, so maybe they realized quickly. But they didn't check the door first. The roommate's point is that closed doors with lights off could still mean someone is in there. So the author didn't follow the social cue properly. \n\nBut the author's explanation is that in their household, doors were closed for energy, not privacy. So it's a cultural difference. The roommate and BF might not accept that as a valid excuse. However, the author did apologize and admit fault. \n\nThe answer might be that the author isn't the asshole because they made an honest mistake based on different norms and apologized. The roommate and BF might be overreacting, but the author isn't wrong because they weren't intentionally rude. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
