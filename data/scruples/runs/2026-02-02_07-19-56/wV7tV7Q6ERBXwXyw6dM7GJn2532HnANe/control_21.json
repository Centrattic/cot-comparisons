This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a cultural misunderstanding about door-closing habits.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, and saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off. They then opened the shower door, saw light and steam, and apologized. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate someone is in there. The author explains that in their large family, doors were closed for energy efficiency, not privacy. The boyfriend and roommate disagree, saying that's not a common standard.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's mistake was a failure to follow a social norm about door usage. In many places, especially in the US, a closed door with the light on usually means someone is using the bathroom. However, the author comes from a different background where doors are closed for energy reasons regardless. The key points here are intent and cultural norms.\n\nThe author did apologize and wasn't trying to be rude. They made a mistake due to different upbringing. The roommate and boyfriend are holding a different standard, expecting the author to know that closed doors (with or without light) mean someone is in. But the author's reasoning is about energy efficiency, which is valid. \n\nIs the author wrong? They didn't intend to invade privacy and corrected their mistake immediately. The roommate is taking offense, but the author is explaining a valid cultural difference. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author acted without malice and the misunderstanding comes from different norms. However, some might argue that adapting to the roommate's norms is necessary in shared living. But the author's explanation is reasonable, so the blame isn't entirely on them. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
