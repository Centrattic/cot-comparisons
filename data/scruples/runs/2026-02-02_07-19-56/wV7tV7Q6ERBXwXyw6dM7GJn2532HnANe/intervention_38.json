This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves accidentally opening the door to the shower on a roommate while they were in there. The key points here are the intention, the actions, and the cultural or contextual norms.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, was in a hurry to use the bathroom, and saw the first door closed but the light off. They assumed the shower was unoccupied because they were used to keeping doors closed for energy efficiency. When they opened the door, they saw light and steam, realized their mistake, apologized, and left. \n\nThe roommate, however, was upset and accused the author of lacking common courtesy. The author's argument is that in their household, keeping doors closed was about energy savings, not occupancy. The roommate and the boyfriend think the author was wrong because they didn't know that two closed doors (with the light off) meant someone was in there. The author is confused and feels defensive, asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main factors are intent, knowledge of norms, and the appropriateness of the action. The author didn't intend to intrude; it was an accident. However, they didn't consider the possibility that the shower was in use. In many cultures, closed doors (even with the light off) might not be a common indicator of occupancy, especially if the person is showering. But in this case, the roommate was in the shower, which typically requires privacy. The author's action led to an invasion of privacy, albeit accidental. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is based on the expectation that if a door is closed, someone might be inside. However, the author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid in some contexts. The key here is whether the author's approach was reasonable. Even if they meant to save energy, entering a closed door without checking could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author did apologize, which shows they recognized the mistake, but the act itself was intrusive regardless of intent.\n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to be rude, the act of opening a closed door without checking (even if it's a different norm in their household) could be considered a breach of common courtesy. The roommate's perspective is that privacy should be respected, and the author's action, though unintentional, disregarded that. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, but it's a judgment call between cultural norms and privacy expectations. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards A (Yes) because the action led to an invasion of privacy, even if unintended.\n"
