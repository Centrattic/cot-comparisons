This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a misunderstanding about door-closing customs.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on and needed to use the bathroom. She noticed the first door was closed but the light was off. She opened the shower part (maybe a second door?) and saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about it, arguing that closed doors indicate someone is inside. The author explained her family's habit of closing doors for energy efficiency, which she continues in her own home. The roommate and her boyfriend disagreed, thinking she was rude for not knowing that closed doors mean someone is using the bathroom.\n\nHmm. In many places, especially in Western cultures, a closed bathroom door usually signals that someone is inside. So maybe the author's assumption that a closed door doesn't mean it's occupied is a cultural or regional difference. The problem here is that the author didn't consider the roommate's perspective, even though she apologized. The roommate felt disrespected because he interpreted the closed door as a privacy signal, which he was entitled to expect. \n\nThe author might not have intended to be rude, but her action did invade the roommate's privacy. Even if she had a good reason for closing doors for energy efficiency, the standard social norm in this context is that a closed door means someone is in there. So even though it was a mistake, she was wrong in not considering that the closed door might indicate the room was occupied. Her explanation is valid, but the action still breached the roommate's privacy, making her at least partially responsible. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the initial mistake was hers. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
