This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author opening a door on their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The author claims it was an accident because they thought the door being closed with the light off meant the bathroom wasn't occupied. The roommate was upset because he thought the closed door with the light off meant someone was using the bathroom. The author explained it was due to energy efficiency in their household, but the roommate and boyfriend disagreed, saying the author lacked common courtesy.\n\nHmm. So, the core issue here is about interpreting the state of a bathroom door. In many places, a closed door with the light off might suggest it's not in use, but others might argue that the door being closed could still mean someone's inside, especially if they're showering. The author's reasoning is that in their household, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, so that's not an indicator of occupation. However, the roommate and boyfriend disagree, thinking that the standard is that closed doors mean someone is using it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did open the door without checking properly, leading to an awkward situation. But they apologized immediately. The key points are whether the author made a reasonable mistake or if they should have known better. The author thought the light being off meant it was free, but that might not be a universal rule. In some homes, people might leave the door closed even if they're not using it for privacy or other reasons. The roommate's perspective is that a closed door with a light on (which was the case here) would indicate someone is inside, but the author saw a light and steam, so maybe they were confused. Wait, the user mentioned that the first door to the bathroom was closed but the light was off, then the shower door was closed. When they opened the shower door, they saw a light and steam. Wait, the user might have written that the bathroom door was closed with the light off, but the shower door's situation? Let me check the original post again.\n\nOriginal post says: \"First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off.\" Wait, so the bathroom door was closed but the light was off. The user opened the shower door, which might be a separate door? Or maybe it's a single bathroom with a shower, and the user thought the bathroom wasn't occupied because the light was off, but then the shower door was closed. But when they opened it, there was light and steam. So perhaps the main bathroom light was off, but the shower area's light was on, leading to confusion. The roommate is upset because he thought that closed doors (both the bathroom and shower doors?) indicated someone was inside. The author's explanation is about energy efficiency, but the roommate felt it was a lack of courtesy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, typically, a closed bathroom door does indicate that someone is using it. However, in some contexts, people might close doors for other reasons. The author's mistake was not checking if someone was inside, but they did apologize. The roommate's reaction is about perception and expectations. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did make a mistake in not verifying if the room was occupied, leading to an invasion of privacy. But in their defense, they had different household norms. However, in most social contexts, a closed bathroom door is a sign that someone is using it. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they should have known better, even if their household had different practices. But then again, if they had checked and the door was closed but no one was inside, maybe they wouldn't have entered. However, in this case, the author did open the door and saw someone. The main issue is whether the author's reasoning is a valid social norm. Since the majority of people would consider a closed bathroom door as occupied, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to that standard, even if they had a different upbringing. The apology is important, but the initial action caused an invasion of privacy. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, some might argue that it's a misunderstanding, and the author isn't the asshole. The key is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. Since they apologized and it was an accident, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Hmm. This is a tough one. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, according to the question, the answer should be A or B. Considering that in most social settings, a closed bathroom door implies someone is inside, the author's mistake was not adhering to that norm, leading to an invasion of privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
