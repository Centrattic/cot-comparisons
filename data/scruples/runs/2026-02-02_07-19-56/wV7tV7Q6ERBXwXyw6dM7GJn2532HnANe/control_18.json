This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the shower door on their bf's roommate, who was in the shower. The author explains that in their large family, they used to lock doors for energy efficiency, not because someone was in there. The roommate and bf are upset, saying that two closed doors and a light off meant someone was using the bathroom. They think the author was rude for not knowing this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author made a mistake. They did open the door by accident, but it's important to consider cultural or household norms. The author's reasoning is based on their upbringing where doors were kept closed for energy reasons, which is a valid point. However, in many places, a closed door with the light on might indicate someone is using the bathroom. But in this case, the light was off. The author went to the first door (bathroom) which was closed but light off, then the shower door. They saw a light and steam, realized their mistake, and left. \n\nThe roommate took it as a personal offense, implying the author was rude on purpose. The author apologized and tried to explain their background. The key here is that the author didn't intend to be rude and corrected their mistake immediately. The roommate's reaction seems overly harsh, especially since the author was apologetic. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, norms can vary. In some places, people might leave the door ajar or use a sign to indicate occupancy, but in others, a closed door might just mean it's closed regardless of use. The energy efficiency argument is also a practical reason. However, the author's mistake was understandable given their background. They didn't ignore the roommate's feelings after the fact; they apologized. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made an accidental mistake and apologized, but the roommate reacted excessively, it's more about misunderstanding norms rather than being in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), because the author acted without malice and took responsibility, while the roommate's reaction is disproportionate given the explanation.\n"
