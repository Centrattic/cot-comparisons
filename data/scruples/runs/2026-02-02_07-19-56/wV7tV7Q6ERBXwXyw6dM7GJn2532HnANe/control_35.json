This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally walking in on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author was in a hurry to pee, had headphones on, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, and then opened the shower door, which was also closed but had steam and light. She immediately apologized and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with the light off mean someone is inside. The author's reasoning is that in her large family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. She owns a house and is conscious about energy costs.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about social norms and expectations regarding bathroom doors. In many cultures, a closed bathroom door typically signals that someone is inside, especially if the light is on or there's steam. However, the author's background is different; she closed doors for energy reasons. She made a mistake, apologized, and didn't intend to be rude. The roommate, on the other hand, felt his privacy was invaded, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend also sided with the roommate, which might influence the perception.\n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. She didn't mean to invade privacy, but she did enter when she shouldn't have. However, her reasoning is based on different cultural norms. The mistake was accidental, and she took responsibility. The roommate's reaction might be overly harsh given that it was a simple accident and she apologized. But from the roommate's perspective, privacy is important, so entering when the door is closed (even if light is off) is a breach.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author's intention wasn't to be rude, the action did breach an expected norm of respecting closed doors as a sign of occupancy. However, her misunderstanding comes from a different family context. So, while she's not in the wrong in a malicious sense, she did make a mistake by not following the assumed social cue. But since it was a genuine accident and she apologized, the severity of her wrongness might be less. The roommate's reaction is also a factor\u2014being overly harsh when the person is apologetic and the mistake wasn't intentional.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made an error in judgment based on different norms, but the intention wasn't malicious. However, she did breach an expectation of privacy. So, maybe she's partially at fault, but not entirely. But the system requires choosing A or B. Given that she didn't mean to be rude and took responsibility, but did enter when she shouldn't have, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the mistake was accidental and she apologized. However, if the norm is to consider closed doors as occupied, then she's in the wrong (A). It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the key is that she didn't intend to invade privacy, so B might be the better choice.\n"
