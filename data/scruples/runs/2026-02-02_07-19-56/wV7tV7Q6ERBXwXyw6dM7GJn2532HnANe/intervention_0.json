This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The situation is a bit nuanced, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, needed to pee, and the bathroom door was closed with the light off. They went to open the shower part, saw a light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset about common courtesy, saying closed doors with the light off indicate someone is in there. The author's reasoning is that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. They own a house and are conscious of energy costs. The roommate and boyfriend disagreed, thinking the author was rude.\n\nSo, the core issue is about differing norms. In many places, especially in shared living situations, a closed door with the light on or steam might be a sign someone is using the bathroom. However, the author's background is in a large household where doors were closed for energy reasons, not to indicate use. The author apologized and admitted fault, but the roommate took it as a lack of common courtesy.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author violate a social norm? The author's intention wasn't to be rude, but their action did cause an invasion of privacy. Even if the norm isn't universal, in the context of the roommate's perspective, the closed door with the light off was a sign. The author's energy efficiency reason is valid, but when in a shared space, respecting others' expectations is important. The author made a mistake but not with malice. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the author did cause an awkward situation. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The answer might be A (yes) because they didn't follow the social cue, but B (no) because it was a misunderstanding and they apologized. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to decide based on norms. In many places, a closed door with light/steam is a sign. The author's explanation is valid, but they should have checked or asked. So maybe A.\n"
