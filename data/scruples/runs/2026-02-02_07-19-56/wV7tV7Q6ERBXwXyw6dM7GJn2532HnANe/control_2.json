This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is the asshole (AITA) for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a misunderstanding about bathroom door etiquette.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, was in a hurry to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they opened the second door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that keeping the first door closed and the light off is a sign someone is in the shower. The author explains that in their family of eight, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and the boyfriend dismissed her explanation, suggesting she's in the wrong. \n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are about cultural norms and expectations. In many households, especially in urban settings, a closed door with the light on might signal someone is inside. The author's family had a different practice for energy reasons, which is a valid point. However, the roommate's expectation was that a closed door with the light off means it's not in use. The author opened the second door without checking if the first was closed, leading to the accidental intrusion.\n\nThe author did apologize and admitted the mistake. But the question is whether they were in the wrong. Even if the intention wasn't to be rude, the action was a privacy violation. The roommate's reaction is about the breach of privacy, not just the method. The author might not be aware that the closed door (with light off) was the roommate's way to indicate it's in use. The boyfriend's agreement suggests that maybe there's a cultural divide here. \n\nSo, while the author's intention wasn't malicious, the action was a mistake. But the roommate's setup (using a closed door with light off as a sign) might not be a universal standard. However, the author should have double-checked, especially since there were signs of use (steam and light). The main issue is the accidental intrusion, not the reason behind the door closing. Even if energy efficiency is a good reason, the author didn't consider the roommate's specific expectations. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong because they didn't respect the roommate's signal, even if it was a cultural difference. But maybe the roommate is also at fault for not communicating the rules better. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the roommate's standard is different and the author's action led to a privacy violation, the answer would be A.\n"
