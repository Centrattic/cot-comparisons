This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author accidentally walked into the roommate's shower. They had headphones on and went to the bathroom because they needed to pee. The first door was closed and the light was off, so they assumed the bathroom wasn't occupied. They opened the shower door and saw light and steam, said sorry, and left.\n\nThe roommate was upset, saying that closed doors and lights off don't mean the bathroom is free, especially in their household. The author's argument is that in their large family, they locked doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone's inside. The roommate and the author's boyfriend took it as a lack of courtesy, but the author didn't mean to be rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are about cultural norms and assumptions. The author's background is different; they were taught to keep doors closed for energy reasons, not as a sign of occupancy. The roommate, however, expected that if the door is closed and the light is on, someone is in there. The author's mistake was based on a different set of learned behaviors.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the roommate's perspective is that closing the door and having the light on is a clear sign someone is using the bathroom. The author misinterpreted this due to their upbringing. While the author didn't intend to be rude and apologized, the situation still caused distress to the roommate. The roommate's reaction might be strong, but the author's action, though accidental, did invade the roommate's privacy, albeit briefly.\n\nThe author could have taken more steps to ensure the bathroom was unoccupied, like knocking or waiting a moment. However, the main issue here is a misunderstanding of social cues. The author's reasoning is valid given their background, but in most places, especially in shared living situations, people use the door being closed and the light on as an indicator of occupancy. So, while the author didn't mean to be rude, their action was a mistake that disregarded the roommate's expectation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
