This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is the asshole (AITA). The scenario is about accidentally opening the door to the shower when the roommate was using it. The author explains that she had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, so she opened the shower door part. She saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate then made a big deal about it, saying she was rude and that closed doors (with the light off) indicate someone's in there. The author's reasoning is based on her family's energy-efficient habits of keeping doors closed, which she continues in her own home.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's wrong. Let's break it down. First, she made a mistake by opening the door without checking properly. She acknowledges that and apologized. The roommate, however, is upset because he believed that a closed door with the light off doesn't mean the room is unoccupied. The author's argument is that in her household, doors are closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. \n\nNow, cultural or household norms can vary. In some places, closed doors might mean someone is inside, while in others, it's just for privacy or energy. The roommate's expectation might be based on his own background. The author's mistake was not knowing his norm, but she did apologize. However, the issue is whether her actions were wrong regardless of intent.\n\nThe key points: Did she intend to be rude? She didn't. But regardless of intent, she entered a private space without checking, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction is about the violation of privacy, not just politeness. Even if her reason was energy efficiency, opening the door without checking could lead to such a situation. So, even if her intention was innocent, the action might still be considered wrong because it invaded someone's privacy. The roommate has a right to expect privacy when using the bathroom. The author's explanation about her family's habits might not excuse the action in this context, especially since she's living in a shared space where others might have different expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend agreeing with the roommate suggests that in their social circle, the norm is that closed doors indicate occupancy. The author's argument is that it's not a universal standard, but in a shared living situation, respecting the roommate's expectations is important. So, while she didn't mean to be rude, her action did invade privacy, making her at least partially at fault. But is she the asshole? The roommate's overreaction might be part of it, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she did make a mistake that led to a privacy breach, even if unintentional, she's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
