This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author had headphones on, was in a hurry to pee, saw the bathroom door closed with the light off, then opened the shower door and saw there was someone there. They said sorry and left. The roommate was upset, saying that shut doors are a sign someone is in there, and the boyfriend and the roommate agreed the author was wrong. The author is confused because in their experience (from a big family and now owning a house), they keep doors shut for energy efficiency, not necessarily to indicate someone is inside.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, closed doors are typically taken as a sign that a room is occupied, especially in shared spaces like bathrooms. Even if the light is off, people might still assume someone is inside, maybe using a towel or something. So, the author might have misread the situation. However, the author's reasoning for closing doors is energy-related, which is a valid point. But in most social contexts, the expectation is that a closed door means someone is in there. \n\nThe author did apologize, which is important. They didn't intend to be rude and were sorry. The roommate, on the other hand, felt invaded and might have a right to be upset. The question is whether the author was wrong to open the door even if it was an accident. The author's mistake was not recognizing the social cue that a closed door usually means someone is using the bathroom. Even if their intention was energy efficiency, the action still caused an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut there's also a cultural or contextual aspect here. The author grew up in a large family where doors were closed for energy reasons, which might have been different from how the roommate was raised. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong in their own context, but in this new situation with the roommate, the social norm clashed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did make a mistake. Even if it was an accident, they should have been more cautious. Maybe checking if there's someone inside before opening the door, even if the door is closed. The roommate's reaction is about privacy, which is a valid concern. So, while the author might not be an asshole for apologizing and being sorry, the action itself was a mistake. \n\nBut is it the author's fault entirely? Maybe the roommate could have been more understanding of different practices. However, the standard expectation in most places is that a closed door means someone is in there. So the author's action, though not malicious, was incorrect in this context. They should have knocked or checked more thoroughly. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
