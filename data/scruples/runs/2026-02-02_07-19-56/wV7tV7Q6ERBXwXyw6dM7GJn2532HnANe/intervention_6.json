This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The author is confused because she thought keeping doors shut for energy efficiency was normal, but the roommate took offense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. She noticed the first door was closed but the light was off, so she opened the shower part. When she saw light and steam, she apologized and left. The roommate was upset about privacy and common courtesy, while the author's reasoning is based on energy efficiency from her family's habits.\n\nNow, the key points here are intentions and cultural norms. The author didn't intend to be rude, but she made a mistake by opening the door without confirming if the bathroom was occupied. The roommate, on the other hand, expected that if a door is closed and the light is off, it might not be a sign of use, but in his culture, closed doors with light on or steam would indicate someone is inside. \n\nThe author did apologize and acknowledged her mistake. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. While her intention wasn't malicious, the action did invade someone else's privacy. Even if it was a mistake, the roommate's reaction is valid because privacy is a common expectation in shared living spaces. \n\nBut maybe the author's cultural background plays a role. She's from a large family where doors were kept closed for energy reasons, so she might not have been aware of the privacy norms. However, in most shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is a standard expectation. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to be rude, her action did violate the roommate's privacy. She should have taken more steps to ensure the bathroom was unoccupied, like knocking or checking for other signs. The roommate's frustration is understandable because the mistake could lead to an invasion of privacy, which is a serious issue.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong, not because she was intentionally rude, but because she failed to respect the roommate's reasonable expectation of privacy. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
