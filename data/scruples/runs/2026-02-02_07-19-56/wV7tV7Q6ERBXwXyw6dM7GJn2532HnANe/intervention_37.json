This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the door to their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. The first door to the bathroom was closed but the light was off, so they assumed it was okay. When they opened the shower part, they saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors mean someone is in there, not that the door is closed for energy efficiency. The author explained their family's habit of keeping doors closed for energy reasons, but the roommate and boyfriend thought the author was being rude.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about cultural norms versus personal habits. The author's background is in a house with eight people, so maybe they're used to different privacy expectations. They mention that in their family, doors are closed mainly for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. That's a valid reason, especially if they're conscious about energy costs. However, in many places, especially in shared living situations, a closed door (with the light on or off) might still be interpreted as someone using the space, especially the shower area, which people usually want privacy for. \n\nThe author did apologize and admitted they were wrong to open the door, but the roommate took it as a personal slight. The question is whether the author's intention and explanation matter, or if the action itself is considered rude regardless. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action was intentional or not. The author didn't mean to invade privacy; they were just following a habit from their upbringing. But in this context, the roommate's expectation was different. Even if the author's reasoning is valid, the result was that someone's privacy was invaded accidentally. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the author did make a mistake in not checking properly. The main issue here is about respecting the roommate's privacy, which is a common expectation. So, even though the author had a good reason, they didn't consider that in the shared space, the roommate would expect the door to indicate occupancy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of not respecting the roommate's privacy, even if it was a mistake based on different habits. But maybe the roommate is also being overly sensitive. \n\nWait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes, B for no. Considering that the author made an accidental intrusion into someone's private moment (showering), even if it was a misunderstanding, the standard social expectation is that a closed door (especially with steam and light) indicates someone is in there. The author's explanation might explain the reasoning, but the action still violated the roommate's privacy. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the standard expectation of privacy when someone is in the shower, regardless of their energy-saving habits. However, if the roommate was using the bathroom in a way that the door was closed but the light was off, maybe that's part of the confusion. But generally, when someone is in the shower, they might have the bathroom door closed, and the shower door closed as well. The author opening the shower door part (assuming that's a separate door) without checking properly could be seen as their mistake. So, in terms of social norms, the author's action was a privacy violation, even if unintentional. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the roommate's privacy, even if their reasoning was based on different habits.\n"
