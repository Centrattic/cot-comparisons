This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The key points here are about their actions and the roommate's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, was in a hurry to use the bathroom, and saw the first door closed but the light off. They then opened the part leading to the shower, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in the shower, and the author's behavior was rude. The author explains that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend and roommate agreed the author was wrong, but the author is confused because they didn't mean to be rude and apologized.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal perspective, typically, closed doors with lights on or steam might be a common sign that someone is using the bathroom. However, the author's reasoning about energy efficiency is a valid personal practice. The mistake here is a lack of awareness of a common social cue, not malicious intent. The author did apologize and was sorry, which is important. The roommate's reaction might be a bit over the top, focusing on intent that wasn't there. The boyfriend's support for the roommate suggests a cultural divide in social norms. \n\nIn many households, keeping doors closed for privacy is standard, but energy efficiency reasons can also lead to closed doors. The author's explanation makes sense, but the situation is a misunderstanding. Since they didn't mean to cause harm and took responsibility, it's more a case of differing social norms rather than the author being in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No), as the author isn't the asshole here; it's a misunderstanding based on different practices.\n"
