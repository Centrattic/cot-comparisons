This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The situation seems to involve a cultural or generational difference in how people interpret door-closing habits.\n\nFirst, the author explains that she had headphones on, heard she needed to pee, and saw the bathroom door closed with the light off. She opened the door to the shower, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about the \"common courtesy\" of doors being shut. The author mentions that in her family of 8, they kept doors shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. She's confused because she apologized and thought the doors being closed wasn't a sign someone was inside. The roommate and her boyfriend think she's rude, but she didn't mean to be.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she didn't mean to intrude, she apologized, and she had a different understanding of door habits. The roommate, on the other hand, felt that closed doors (especially two doors) with the light off indicated occupation. But the author's reasoning was about energy efficiency. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nIn most social norms, a closed door typically indicates privacy, especially in a bathroom. Even if her family didn't use that as a signal, stepping into someone's shower area without checking is generally considered a privacy violation. However, she had a misunderstanding and was apologetic. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the act of opening the door without knowing the person's presence could still be seen as a mistake, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, considering that privacy norms are pretty standardized in most Western societies, even if the author's family had different practices, she should learn to adapt to the roommate's environment. The author made a mistake by not checking properly, even if her intent wasn't malicious. But the roommate's reaction seems harsh and possibly hypocritical if the door was closed but the light off. Maybe the roommate was in the shower with the main door closed but the light off, which the author misread.\n\nIn the end, while the author's intentions were good and she apologized, the action itself did invade the roommate's privacy due to a misjudgment of social cues. Therefore, she might be in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, given the norms of privacy, the answer leaning towards A (Yes) makes sense.\n"
