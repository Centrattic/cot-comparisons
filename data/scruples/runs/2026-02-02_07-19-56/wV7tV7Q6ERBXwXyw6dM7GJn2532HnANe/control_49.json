This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author had headphones on and didn't realize the door was shut, thinking the unlit bathroom was empty. They opened the door to the shower, saw steam and light, apologized, and left. The roommate then made a big deal about common courtesy, saying that closed doors (even if the light is off) mean someone is in there. The author's explanation was that in their family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. The boyfriend and the roommate both thought the author lost the argument, implying they were at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author made a mistake. Accidentally opening the door when the person is in the shower is a privacy violation. Even if the author's intention was not to be rude, the action itself was inappropriate. The roommate's point is that a closed door should be respected as a sign someone is using the bathroom, regardless of the light. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency might not be the standard in all households, especially if the roommate and boyfriend have a different understanding.\n\nIn most modern homes, a closed door to the bathroom typically signals that someone is inside, even if the light is off. The author's habit might be practical for energy, but it's not a common understanding. The key here is that the author didn't check if the door was locked or if someone was in there before entering. The fact that the roommate was in the shower adds to the sensitivity of the situation. While the author apologized, the mistake was still a breach of privacy. However, the roommate's reaction might be over the top, expecting a different standard without considering the author's background. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The action was accidental, but the responsibility lies in respecting others' privacy. The author might not have known the local custom, but in a shared living space, it's reasonable to assume that closed doors mean someone is inside. So, the author's mistake was in not being aware of that and not checking if the room was occupied. The roommate's reaction, while maybe harsh, is about privacy. The author should have been more cautious, even if their intention wasn't to be rude. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A because the author, despite their intentions, violated the roommate's privacy by not respecting the closed door, which is a common courtesy in shared living situations.\n"
