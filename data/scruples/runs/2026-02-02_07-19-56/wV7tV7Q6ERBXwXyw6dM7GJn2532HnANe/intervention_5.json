This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door to their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a cultural or social norm misunderstanding about door-closing habits.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had headphones on, was in a hurry to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off. They opened the shower part, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate got angry, saying closed doors with lights off indicate someone's in there. The author argues that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not privacy. The boyfriend and roommate think she was rude, hence the conflict.\n\nNow, considering social norms. In many cultures, if a bathroom door is closed, even with the light off, it's often assumed someone is inside. But the author's explanation is that in their household, doors were closed for energy reasons. However, when you're in someone else's home, adapting to their norms is usually expected. Even if it's a cultural difference, the mistake was in opening the door despite the roommate's privacy. \n\nThe author did apologize, which is important. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong. The roommate's perspective is that a closed door with the light off isn't a reliable indicator, and in their experience, that's how it's done. The author's argument is about energy efficiency, but that's not about privacy. So, the author's action, while unintentional, still invaded the roommate's privacy. \n\nThe boyfriend and roommate's reaction might be harsh, but the core issue is that the author didn't follow the roommate's expectations for privacy. Even if it was a mistake, the outcome was a privacy violation. So, the author is in the wrong because they should have known that a closed bathroom door implies privacy, regardless of their family's habits. The answer is A.\n"
