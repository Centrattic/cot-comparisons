This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for accidentally walking in on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The situation is that she had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off. She opened the door to the shower, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying she was rude and that closed doors mean someone's in there. The author explains that in her family of eight, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. Her boyfriend and the roommate agreed she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she was in the wrong. The key points here are about social norms versus personal habits. In many cultures, a closed door with the light on typically signals someone is inside. However, the author's upbringing taught her to close doors for energy reasons, not to indicate occupancy. She did apologize and didn't intend to be rude. \n\nBut the problem is that her actions led to invading someone's privacy. Even if it was a misunderstanding, the result was that she walked in on someone in the shower. The roommate's reaction is about privacy, which is a significant issue. The author's reasoning is based on her past, but in a shared living situation, it's important to adapt to the norms of that environment. While she apologized, the fact remains that she entered a private space unintentionally but still caused discomfort. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a social perspective, using a closed door with the light on as an indicator is common. If she was in a new living situation, she should have been aware of that norm. However, she had a valid reason based on her upbringing. But the outcome is that someone's privacy was violated. So even if it was accidental, the act of entering without checking properly (like knocking or using a shower occupied sign if available) could be seen as a mistake. \n\nThe boyfriend and roommate's reactions might be overblown, but the author's actions led to a privacy breach. She's not intentionally rude, but she did make an error in judgment based on her habits. So, while she's not an asshole, she was wrong in how she handled it. But maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because it was an accident and she apologized. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the mistake was her fault. Since she didn't check properly and relied on her past habits in a new situation, maybe she's at fault. But again, it was an accident. Hmm. The question is asking if she's in the wrong. In social norms, entering someone's bathroom when the door is closed (even if light is off) might be seen as wrong. The author's reasoning is understandable, but the outcome is that she violated privacy. So the answer could be A, she's in the wrong, because she didn't follow the social norm of the new environment, even if it was due to her upbringing. Or B, because it was an accident and she apologized. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) standard is about whether the person is an asshole. Since she apologized and didn't mean to be rude, maybe not. But the actions still caused a problem. The community often considers intent. Since she didn't intend to be rude, maybe she's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
