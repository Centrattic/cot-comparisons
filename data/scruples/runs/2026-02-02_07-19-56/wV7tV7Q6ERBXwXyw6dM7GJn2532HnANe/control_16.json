This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a cultural misunderstanding about door-closing habits.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, was in a hurry, and assumed the door was closed for energy efficiency. She saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate, however, felt that closing the door meant someone was in there, leading to a conflict. The author's background includes a large family where doors were closed for energy reasons, not privacy. Her boyfriend and the roommate disagreed, saying she lacked common courtesy.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author act with intent to invade privacy? She apologized immediately, didn't linger, and was unaware of the local norm. However, the roommate's perspective is that closed doors mean someone is using the space. The author's explanation is valid, but in many contexts, especially in shared living, people might interpret closed doors as occupied. \n\nWhile the author didn't mean to be rude, her actions led to an invasion of privacy, even if unintentional. The roommate's reaction is about personal boundaries. The author's energy efficiency reasoning is a cultural factor, but in shared spaces, respecting others' privacy norms is important. The boyfriend and roommate's agreement suggests the author's actions were seen as a breach of trust or privacy, which is a valid concern. So, technically, the author might be in the wrong because her actions, though not malicious, disregarded the roommate's expectations of privacy.\n"
