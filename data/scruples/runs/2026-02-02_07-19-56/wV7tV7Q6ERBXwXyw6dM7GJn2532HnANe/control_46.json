This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accidentally walked into the boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. She had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door closed with the light off, then opened the shower door and saw light and steam. She apologized and left, but the roommate was really upset, saying it was a matter of common courtesy. The author explains that in her family and her own home, they keep doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate if someone's inside. The roommate and her boyfriend think she was wrong, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about differing social norms. In some places, a closed door with the light off might mean someone's in the bathroom, while in others, people close doors for other reasons. The author made a mistake by opening the door without checking if someone was in, but she didn't intend to be rude. The roommate, however, felt violated and was upset. \n\nFrom a general perspective, most people might consider that a closed bathroom door with a light on (or steam) is a sign someone's in there. The author might not have been aware of that norm, but the mistake still caused an invasion of privacy. Even if it was accidental, the fact that she opened the door without verifying if it was occupied could be seen as a lack of consideration. However, the roommate's reaction might be over the top, and the author did apologize. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she made an error in judgment, but she didn't have malicious intent. On the other, the roommate's perspective is valid because privacy is expected in such situations. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a valid reason for closing doors, but it doesn't negate the fact that the action led to an invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since she admitted fault, apologized, and learned from the mistake, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But the action itself did violate the roommate's expectation of privacy. The key here is that the roommate felt disrespected, and the author's actions, while unintentional, contributed to that. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the situation, even if it was unintentional.\n"
