This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The main points are about whether closing doors and turning off lights indicate someone is in the bathroom.\n\nThe author mentions that in their family of eight, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. They own their house and care about energy costs. When the roommate got upset, the author apologized but explained their reasoning. The roommate and the boyfriend disagreed, saying that closed doors and lights off mean someone is in there, so opening the door was rude. The author is confused and thinks maybe they're just not aware of a common standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, especially in Western households, a closed bathroom door often signals that someone is inside, even if the light is off. But the author's background is different\u2014energy efficiency is their main reason. So the conflict is between different norms.\n\nIs the author wrong for not knowing this? Well, they apologized and didn't intend to be rude. They explained their reasoning. The roommate took offense, but the author's mistake was unintentional. The key here is intent. The author didn't mean to be inconsiderate; they had a different understanding. However, in the roommate's perspective, the action was disrespectful because a closed door is a social norm. \n\nBut maybe the roommate overreacted. The author didn't have malicious intent, and the explanation makes sense. However, in the context of roommates, respecting each other's privacy is important. The roommates might have different habits, and the author's action, while accidental, was a breach of privacy. Even if unintentional, the result was invading someone's privacy. So there's a balance between different habits and respecting others' expectations in shared living.\n\nThe author did apologize, so they took responsibility. The roommate's reaction was harsh, but the action still caused discomfort. So in terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't mean to be rude, but the action did have consequences. However, considering the explanation and the apology, maybe they aren't the asshole. But the roommate's perspective is valid too. \n\nI think the key is whether the author's action was wrong. Accidentally opening the door isn't malicious, but they should have been more aware of the social norms of the house they're staying in. Since they were in a shared space, adapting to the roommates' expectations might be necessary. However, the author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid in their own context. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have been more considerate. However, the question is if they are the asshole. The answer would depend on whether the mistake was inconsiderate despite the explanation. Since they apologized and didn't mean to, maybe the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the roommate's reaction is valid, the author might be partially in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
