This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. They had headphones on and were in a hurry to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they went to the second door, which was also closed. They thought the doors were closed for energy efficiency, not because someone was in there. They apologized and explained their reasoning, but the roommate and the boyfriend took offense, saying it was a matter of common courtesy to understand that closed doors with the light off indicate someone is using the bathroom.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the person didn't intend to intrude, they made a mistake, apologized, and there was a cultural difference in their upbringing about door etiquette. The roommate, however, felt it was a serious breach of courtesy. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal norms versus the author's intent and apology.\n\nIn many places, especially in Western cultures, closed doors with the light off in bathrooms do often signal that someone is inside. However, the author comes from a background where doors are closed for energy efficiency. The mistake was accidental, and they did apologize. The roommate's reaction seems harsh, but the author's actions were unintentional. The boyfriend supporting the roommate might be due to differing expectations, but the author isn't malicious.\n\nSo, the author made an honest mistake, took responsibility, and learned from it. The roommate's response is more about cultural assumptions. Since the author didn't act with malice and corrected the mistake, they might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that they should have been more aware of the roommate's expectations. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being the asshole since their intentions were good and they apologized.\n"
