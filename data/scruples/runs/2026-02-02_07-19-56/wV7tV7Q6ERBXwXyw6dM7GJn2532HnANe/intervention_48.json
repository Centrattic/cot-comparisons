This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the door to the roommate's shower. The author had headphones on, thought the bathroom was empty because the light was off, and opened the door, seeing steam and light. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with lights off mean someone's in there. The author explained that in their large family, they used to shut doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate they were using the space. The roommate and the author's boyfriend both said the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author made a mistake by opening the door without checking if the bathroom was occupied. They had headphones on, so maybe their attention was elsewhere. They thought the door was closed because the light was off, but they didn't check for other signs like steam or hearing water. However, the roommate's argument is that closed doors with lights off (even if off) might not be the only indicator. Wait, the author saw steam and light when they opened the door. Wait, the situation says the first door to the bathroom was shut, but the light was off. Then they opened the part to the shower and saw light and steam. Wait, maybe the shower room is a separate door. So the main bathroom door was closed with the light off, but the shower room inside was in use. So the author went into the shower area, which was lit and had steam. So maybe the main bathroom light was off, but the shower was in use. So the author's mistake was assuming the bathroom wasn't in use just because the main light was off. But the roommate's point is that when doors are closed, you should assume someone is in there. The author's reasoning was based on energy efficiency, but the roommate and others think that closed doors indicate occupancy.\n\nSo, in most shared living situations, the norm is that a closed door with light on means someone is in there. If the light is off, maybe not. But the author assumed that even with the light off, if the door is closed, it's for energy, not occupancy. However, in reality, people usually leave the light on if they're using the bathroom. If the light is off, maybe the room is empty. But in this case, the author went into the shower part, which had light and steam. So maybe the roommate was in the shower and the main bathroom light was off, but the shower area had light. The author didn't check if the main bathroom was occupied, just assumed. But in their family, they closed doors for energy, so they thought the door being closed didn't mean someone was inside. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's assumption was reasonable. In most places, a closed door with the light on (or steam) would indicate someone is in there. But the author didn't check. They just opened the door. So even if they thought they were saving energy, it's a social norm that you don't open doors without checking if someone is in there. The roommate's reaction is based on that norm. The author's mistake was not checking properly, leading to an intrusion. Even if they apologized, the action was a breach of privacy. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't follow the social norm of checking if the bathroom was occupied. The roommate's reaction, while possibly harsh, is based on that norm. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a valid reason for closing doors, but it doesn't excuse not checking if someone is actually in there. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
