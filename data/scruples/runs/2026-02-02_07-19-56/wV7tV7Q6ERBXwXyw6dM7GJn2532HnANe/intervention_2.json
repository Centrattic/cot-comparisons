This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally walking into her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The situation is that the author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, then opened the shower door and found the roommate in there. She apologized and explained her reasoning about energy efficiency, but the roommate and her boyfriend took it as a personal offense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, closed doors, especially in shared spaces, are expected to mean someone is in the room. Even if the light is off, opening the door without checking could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency is valid, but in many cultures, closed doors in bathrooms are also about privacy, not just energy. The roommate's reaction is about privacy being violated, which is a common concern. The author did apologize, so intent matters. She didn't mean to be rude, but the action did invade someone's privacy. The key point is whether the action (opening the door without checking) was wrong regardless of intent. \n\nIn most social contexts, entering a closed bathroom door is considered a serious breach of privacy. Even if the light was off, people might still be in the shower, as shown here. The author's explanation about her family's practices doesn't negate the social norm here. The roommate's reaction, while possibly over the top, is based on the violation of privacy. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate suggests that the social norm is on their side. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was not malicious. She made a mistake in judgment. The question is whether the mistake makes her the asshole. The AITA forums often consider intent and whether the person acknowledged their mistake. The author did apologize and tried to explain, but the social norm violation is significant. So, even though she didn't mean to be rude, the action still caused a privacy issue. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. But given the norms, the answer is probably A.\n"
