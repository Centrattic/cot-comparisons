This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about opening the door to the bathroom where the boyfriend's roommate is in the shower. The author had headphones on, noticed the first bathroom door was closed with the light off, then opened what they thought was the shower part. They saw steam and a light, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset about it, saying it's a common courtesy thing where closed doors with the light on mean someone's in there. The author argues that in their experience, closed doors are for energy efficiency, not necessarily occupation.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the author misread the situation and thus was at fault. The author did apologize, but the roommate was really upset. The author's own reasoning is based on their background and energy-saving habits. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they were in a hurry, had headphones on, and made a mistake based on their upbringing. They didn't intend to be rude and apologized. But from the roommate's perspective, they expected that if a door is closed and the light is on, someone is using the bathroom. The author closed the first door but the light was off, then opened another part leading to the shower. The roommate felt disrespected because they thought the door being closed with the light on (maybe the shower room?) indicated someone was in there. Wait, the author said the first door's light was off. Then they opened the shower part and saw a light and steam. Maybe the shower room is a separate area? Maybe the main bathroom door was closed with the light off, but the shower room inside was in use. So the author didn't check properly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, in most places, if a door is closed and there's steam and light, it's a sign someone is in there. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency might not be as widely recognized as a reason to leave doors closed. Even if that's their practice, others might not follow it, so the author might not have considered that. The roommate's reaction is about privacy and courtesy, which is a common concern. The author's mistake was not checking properly, even though they thought they were saving energy. The key point is that the author's action led to a privacy invasion, which is a big deal. Even if they apologized, the fact that they didn't understand the social cue could make them at fault. The roommate's perspective is valid because maintaining privacy is important in shared living spaces. The author might not have been malicious, but they did overlook a common expectation. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong. But some might argue that it's a misunderstanding, not intentional. However, the question is whether they're the asshole. The roommate and the boyfriend agreed that the author lost the argument. The author's actions were a mistake, but the roommate's reaction is about a valid privacy concern. So I lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a mistake that violated someone else's privacy, even if unintentionally. The author's explanation might be valid in their context, but in this situation, respecting others' privacy is a more critical social norm.\n"
