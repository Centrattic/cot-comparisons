This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The situation is a bit confusing because the author is from a big family where they used to lock doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. Now, the roommate is upset, saying that closed doors and a light off mean someone is in there. The author apologized, but the roommate keeps bringing up common courtesy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had headphones on and didn't notice the first bathroom door was closed. They went into the shower area, saw light and steam, and quickly apologized. The roommate is making a big deal about it, implying the author was rude and lacked common courtesy. The author's defense is that in their family, closed doors were for energy efficiency, not to signal if someone was inside. The boyfriend agreed with the roommate, so the author is feeling like they lost the argument.\n\nThe main issue here is the cultural or situational norm difference. In the author's background, it was normal to keep doors closed for energy, whereas the roommate interprets closed doors as a sign that someone is using the bathroom. The question is whether the author was wrong to not follow the roommate's expectation. \n\nIn many places, especially in smaller living situations, people do use the bathroom door's state (open/closed, light on/off) to indicate if it's occupied. The author's approach might not be common in the roommate's environment. Even though the author had a good intention and apologized, the act of opening the door without confirming if it's occupied is a privacy issue. The roommate's reaction is about the violation of personal space, which is a valid concern. However, the author's explanation provides context for their behavior, which might not be malicious but a misunderstanding of norms.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they made a mistake by not checking properly, but they didn't do it intentionally. The roommate's perspective is about respecting privacy, which is important. The author's argument is about a different upbringing and habits. The answer might depend on whether the mistake was due to negligence or a genuine misunderstanding. Since the author was in a hurry and had headphones on, their attention might have been impaired. However, even in a big family, learning to check if a bathroom is occupied is a basic courtesy. Maybe the author is not entirely wrong, but they did overlook the local norm. The roommate's reaction is harsh, but the author's action did intrude on privacy. \n\nSo considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take the standard practice into account. But their reasoning is valid as a mitigating factor. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. In such cases, even if there's a good reason, the act itself is an invasion of privacy, so maybe the answer is A, yes. But others might argue that the roommate is being too rigid. I need to decide based on the context provided.\n"
