This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The writer explains that they had their headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off, then opened the shower door. There was a light and steam, so they said sorry and left. The roommate got upset about common courtesy, saying doors that are shut mean someone's in there. The writer's family and friends keep doors shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend and roommate agreed she was wrong, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are: the writer made a mistake but didn't intend to invade privacy. They apologized and explained their reasoning. The roommate felt it was a violation of common courtesy. The writer's background is in a large family where doors are closed for energy, not to signify someone's inside. Now, in a shared living situation, norms can vary. The roommate's expectation is that closed doors mean someone's in there, which is a common standard in many places. However, the writer's explanation is about energy efficiency, which is valid but perhaps not widely known in this context.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The author did make a mistake by opening the door when the roommate was in the shower. Even if the reasoning is about energy, the action led to an invasion of privacy. However, the writer apologized and acknowledged the mistake. The roommate's reaction is about the expectation of privacy, which is understandable. In many social contexts, closing a door is indeed a sign that someone is using the room. The writer might not have known this norm, but in a shared living situation, it's reasonable to expect that residents follow local customs. The boyfriend's agreement with the roommate suggests that the norm in their area is different from the writer's past experience.\n\nSo, while the writer didn't intend to be rude and apologized, the action did breach the roommate's privacy. The mistake is understandable given their background, but in this situation, the standard is that closed doors indicate occupancy. Therefore, the writer is at fault for not adhering to that norm, even if it's due to a cultural difference. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
