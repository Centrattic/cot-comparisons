This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. \n\nFirst, the situation: She had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, and opened the shower door (assuming it was empty because of the energy-saving habit from her large family). When she opened it, she saw steam and light, realized someone was in there, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone's in there. She explained her reasoning about energy efficiency, but he and her bf disagreed, making her feel like an asshole.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether her actions were rude or inconsiderate. She claims it was a mistake based on her habits. The roommate and bf believe that closed doors (and lights on) mean someone's in there. She apologizes, but they see her as lacking common courtesy.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and communication. In some households, people might leave doors open when they're not in use to save energy. But in other contexts, closing the door is standard even when you're not in the room. The author's reasoning is about energy efficiency, which is a valid concern, but the key point is whether closing the door is a social norm that indicates someone is inside.\n\nThe problem is that the roommate expected that if a door is closed, especially with the shower area, it's likely occupied. The author didn't check in another way, like knocking or listening for sounds. She assumed the light being off meant the room was empty, but the steam and light from the shower indicated otherwise. \n\nHer intention was to save energy, but the outcome was invading someone's privacy. Even if unintentional, she did cause an awkward situation. While she did apologize, the fact that she made a mistake in judgment about the door's status could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. However, she didn't mean to be rude, so it's an accident. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the norm in the shared living space is that closed doors mean someone's there, then she should follow that. Her explanation about energy is valid, but she should have adapted to the local norms. Maybe she didn't consider that the roommate's presence in the shower would be indicated by a closed door. \n\nSo, while her actions were accidental, she might be at fault for not being aware of the social cues in the shared space. The roommate's reaction is about respecting boundaries, which is important. The author's energy-saving habit might not align with the roommate's expectations. Therefore, she's partly in the wrong for not adhering to the social norm of the house, even if her intention was good.\n"
