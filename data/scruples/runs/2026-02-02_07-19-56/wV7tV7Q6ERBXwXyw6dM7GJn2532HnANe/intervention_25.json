This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me try to parse this out.\n\nThe situation is that the author accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. They noticed the first door was closed but the light was off, so they went to the shower part, opened that door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about it, saying that closed doors (with light off) indicate someone is in there. The author explained that in their family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and boyfriend thought the author was being rude, but the author didn't mean to. They're now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, accidental vs. intentional. The author didn't intentionally open the door. They made a mistake in interpreting the door's status. The roommate might have had a different expectation. In many cultures, closed doors (with light on) are seen as occupied. If the author didn't consider that, maybe they overlooked a common courtesy. But the author had a different reason, energy efficiency. That's valid, but maybe they should have knocked or checked more carefully.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a reasonable expectation that the door was unoccupied? The first door was closed but the light was off. However, the shower door was open, and the author went to open it. Even if they thought the first door was closed for energy, they should have checked the shower door's status. Maybe they didn't consider that someone might be in the shower even if the first door was closed. The author's explanation is that they thought doors are closed for energy, but in reality, people often close doors for privacy. So there's a cultural norm difference here.\n\nThe author did apologize and was sorry, which is good. But the roommate felt violated, which is a valid reaction. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could be if they ignored a common social cue. However, if the author genuinely didn't know the standard, it's a misunderstanding rather than being in the wrong. The roommate's reaction is extreme, but it's about privacy. The author's mistake was opening the door without checking, even if it was accidental.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author had a good reason, they should have been more cautious. The correct answer might depend on whether the author should have known the standard. Since they were in a shared living space, they should be aware that doors might be closed for privacy. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering that and not double-checking.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on their upbringing. So there's a clash of norms. The roommate's privacy was invaded, even if accidentally. The author is not malicious, but maybe they didn't take necessary precautions. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have known the standard in a shared space. Alternatively, if the standard wasn't clear, maybe not. But typically, closed doors in a bathroom indicate privacy. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
