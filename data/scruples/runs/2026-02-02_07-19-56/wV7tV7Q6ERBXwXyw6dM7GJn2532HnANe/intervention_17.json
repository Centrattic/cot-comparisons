This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower.\n\nFirst, the situation: She had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed with the light off. She went to the shower part, opened it, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicated someone was in there. She explained that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not privacy, and she was sorry. The roommate and her boyfriend thought she was rude and that she didn't have common courtesy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's analyze. The key points are the expectations of privacy vs. energy efficiency. In many cultures, closed doors in bathrooms are a privacy indicator. However, the author's background is different, emphasizing energy savings. The mistake was accidental, and she apologized immediately. The roommate, however, took it as intentional rudeness. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. While she made a mistake, she didn't intend to intrude. She took responsibility and explained her reasoning. The roommate's reaction might be based on his own cultural norms, but the author's explanation shows her perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't act with malice. The mistake was unintentional, and she took steps to address it. The roommate's reaction is more about differing standards. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as the error was accidental and she showed remorse. However, some might argue that she should have been aware of the privacy norm, but since her background is different, it's a cultural misunderstanding. The main issue is the roommate's overreaction. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
