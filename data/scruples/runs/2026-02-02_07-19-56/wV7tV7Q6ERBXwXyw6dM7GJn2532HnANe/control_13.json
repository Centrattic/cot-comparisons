This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they assumed the bathroom was empty. They opened the shower part, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, claiming that closed doors indicate someone is in there. The author explained their family's habit of closing doors for energy efficiency, and the roommate dismissed that, saying only rude people close doors. The boyfriend sided with the roommate.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Generally, in many cultures, a closed door with the light on usually means someone is inside. However, the author's reasoning is that they're used to a household where doors are closed to save energy, not to indicate privacy. The key points here are intent and cultural context. The author didn't mean to invade privacy, but their assumption was different from the roommate's expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong? On one hand, they made a mistake by not confirming if the bathroom was occupied. But their mistake stemmed from a different understanding of door-closing practices. They did apologize immediately. On the other hand, the roommate's expectation that closed doors always mean someone's inside is valid in many contexts. So there's a clash in social norms here.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite their intentions. Since the roommate felt violated, even accidentally, the author might be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily an asshole. The argument here is about differing standards. The author isn't malicious; they just have a different upbringing. So, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely at fault, but they could have been more cautious.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, people often get upset when someone enters a bathroom without checking properly. However, the author's explanation about energy efficiency adds nuance. The roommate's reaction is harsh, but the author did apologize. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might be influenced by his own social norms.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a mistake, their intent wasn't to be rude. The roommate's reaction is justified to some extent, but the author isn't the asshole. They're not in the wrong because it was an accident based on different family practices, and they apologized immediately. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
