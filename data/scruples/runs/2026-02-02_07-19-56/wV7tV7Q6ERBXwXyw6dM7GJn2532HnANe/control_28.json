This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, and saw the first door closed but the light off. They assumed the bathroom wasn't occupied because in their family, closed doors were for energy efficiency. They opened the shower door, saw steam and light, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying it was a matter of common courtesy that closed doors indicate someone is in there. The author's boyfriend sided with the roommate, making the author feel like they lost the argument.\n\nNow, the key points. The author didn't intend to be rude and did apologize. However, the issue is whether the action was wrong regardless of intent. The main question is about societal norms versus the author's personal habits. In many places, a closed bathroom door with the light on usually signals someone is inside. If the author's assumption led to an accident, did they make a mistake?\n\nThe roommate's perspective is that closed doors mean occupied, so opening it without checking was a breach of privacy. The author's defense is about energy efficiency and different family norms. But even if their family does it differently, when entering someone else's home, adapting to their norms might be expected. The author might not have known the roommate's expectations, but the consequences (walking in on someone showering) are significant. The apology was given, but the roommate felt violated. \n\nIs the author the asshole? Well, the action was a mistake, but the roommate is within their right to be upset. The author's explanation might show they didn't intend harm, but the action still invaded privacy. In public or shared spaces, respecting others' privacy is a common standard. The author's reasoning is valid in their context, but in this situation, the mistake was made. The roommate's reaction is about privacy boundaries. So, while the author isn't malicious, they are in the wrong because they didn't respect the roommate's expectation of privacy, even if unintentionally. So, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
