This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong after accidentally opening the door to their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light was off, so they opened the shower door. When they did, they saw light and steam and immediately apologized. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is inside, and that the person was being rude. The author explained that in their family, they close doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend agreed with the roommate, making the author question if they're the asshole here.\n\nNow, considering social norms, typically closed doors are assumed to mean someone is inside. However, the author has a different background where doors are closed for other reasons. The key points are: Did the author act intentionally? They said they made a mistake, not on purpose. They apologized immediately. The roommate's reaction seems harsh, but the author's reasoning is valid in their context. However, in most social settings, a closed door with no light might be ambiguous, but adding steam and light from inside would usually signal someone is there. The author might not have been aware of this cue. \n\nThe author's explanation about their family's habits is a valid reason, but in this situation, the immediate context (steam and light) should have been a clearer indicator. Even if their intention wasn't to be rude, the action did invade the roommate's privacy, which is a valid concern. The roommate's reaction is extreme, but the author's mistake is understandable given their background. Since they apologized and it was an accident, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the roommate's perspective is that it's about common courtesy, which the author might have overlooked. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the social cues, even if it was a mistake. But also, their explanation shows a different standard. The answer is a bit nuanced, but since they did apologize and it was an accident, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the roommate's privacy was invaded, which is a valid point. The decision would be A or B based on whether the mistake counts as being in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it was a genuine mistake and they apologized, but some might argue A because they didn't notice the cues. However, given the context of their upbringing, B makes sense.\n"
