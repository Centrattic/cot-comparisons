This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door to the roommate's shower. The situation is that the author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, and then opened the shower door. When they saw the roommate in the shower, they apologized and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone's in there, and the author defended their actions by mentioning their family's practice of keeping doors shut for energy efficiency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were indeed wrong. The key points here are about social norms versus the author's personal habits. In many cultures, a closed door with the light off might be assumed to be unoccupied, but in others, especially in shared living situations, a closed door might still mean someone is inside. The roommate's reaction suggests that he expected the closed door to mean he was using the bathroom, which the author didn't consider. However, the author did apologize and didn't intend to be rude, so intent matters here.\n\nEnergy efficiency might be a valid reason for their family's habits, but in a shared space, it's important to adjust to the norms of that environment. The author might not have been aware that in this particular setting, a closed door with the light off isn't a common indicator of absence. However, they did make a mistake, even if accidental. The roommate's reaction is about respecting privacy and boundaries, which is a valid concern. The author's explanation is reasonable, but the mistake still caused discomfort. \n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to be rude and did apologize, the mistake was in not adapting to the shared living situation's norms. The roommate's perspective is about respecting personal space, which is a social norm in many places. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the expected unspoken rules of that environment, even if their intent was innocent. But some might argue that it's a misunderstanding rather than willful disregard. The answer isn't black and white, but in terms of typical social expectations, the author likely made an error in judgment.\n"
