This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the door to the bathroom where her boyfriend's roommate was in the shower. She had headphones on, saw the first door was shut but the light was off, and then opened the next door. She apologized, but the roommate was upset, saying she was rude and lacked common courtesy. The author's defense is that in her family, they kept doors shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone was using the room.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the author was wrong in opening the door. The roommate's perspective is that when doors are shut and the light is off, it's a sign that the room is occupied. The author, however, comes from a different background where doors are kept shut for energy reasons, not to signal occupancy. She didn't mean to be rude, but the roommate saw it as a lack of common courtesy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In most Western cultures, a closed door with the light off usually means someone is in the bathroom. If you're in a shared living space, it's generally expected that people use common courtesies, like checking if a door is closed or if there's a \"do not disturb\" sign. The author's argument is that her intention was different, but the action still caused an invasion of privacy. Even if she didn't mean to be rude, the result was that the roommate was caught off guard and felt disrespected.\n\nThe author did apologize, which is a good step. However, the mistake was made because she didn't follow the local customs or the expected norms of the house. The roommate's reaction, while possibly a bit harsh, is based on the assumption that a closed door means the room is occupied. The author's energy-saving practice is a personal choice, but in a shared space, respecting others' privacy and adapting to their norms is important.\n\nSo, technically, the author made a mistake by not recognizing the standard signs of occupancy. She was in a shared living space, so she should have been aware of the common courtesies expected there. Even if her family had different practices, moving into a new environment often requires adjusting to the local norms. The fact that she didn't realize that a closed door with the light off (or on?) indicates someone is inside shows a lack of awareness of social cues in that setting. Therefore, she's at least partially in the wrong for not being attentive to the standard indicators of whether someone is in the bathroom. However, she did apologize and was sorry, which mitigates some responsibility. But the mistake was hers to make, so the answer would be A.\n"
