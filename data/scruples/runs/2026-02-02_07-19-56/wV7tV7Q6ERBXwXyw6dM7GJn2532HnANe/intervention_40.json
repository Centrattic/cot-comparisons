This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person opened the shower door without knowing someone was in there. They had headphones on, the bathroom door was closed but the light was off. They went to open the shower part, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset, saying doors being closed are a sign someone's in there. The author's reasoning was about energy efficiency, which they grew up with and still practice.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong. They made a mistake, but it was an accident. They apologized. The roommate was offended and thought it was a clear sign the bathroom was occupied. The author's argument is that in their experience, closed doors don't always mean someone's inside, especially for energy reasons.\n\nNow, societal norms typically consider closed doors as a sign of privacy or occupancy. Even if the light is off, some people might leave the door closed for other reasons. However, the author's intention wasn't to be rude; it was a genuine mistake. The roommate's reaction is about common courtesy and expectations. But the author's background influenced their actions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. They did accidentally intrude, but it was unintentional. They apologized. The roommate expected a different standard. Cultural differences in household norms can exist. However, in most contexts, entering a closed bathroom door, regardless of the reason, is seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the author's reasoning is valid, the action was a mistake. So, technically, the author might be at fault for not checking properly, even if it was an accident. But the roommate's overreaction might also be part of the problem. \n\nBut the key is whether the author is wrong. Since they made a mistake in judgment and caused an intrusion, even if unintentional, they could be considered in the wrong. However, if the mistake was due to genuine misunderstanding of the norms, maybe not. But in most situations, people are expected to check if someone is in the bathroom. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they entered without confirming the bathroom was empty, even if it was an accident. But B (No) could argue that it was a cultural misunderstanding and not intentional. The line between the two is thin. The author's explanation is valid, but the action still caused an issue. So, leaning towards A.\n"
