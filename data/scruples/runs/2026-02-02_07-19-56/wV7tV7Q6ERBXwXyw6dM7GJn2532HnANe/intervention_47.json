This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The author had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light off, then opened the shower door and saw steam and light, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about it, saying it was a matter of common courtesy that closed doors mean someone's in there.\n\nSo first, did the author make a mistake? Well, she did open a door without checking properly, leading to a privacy issue. But she apologized and didn't mean to be rude. The roommate took it as a deliberate act of rudeness. The author's reasoning is that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate someone's using it. Now, in most places, a closed bathroom door with the light on usually signals someone is inside. So the author might not be aware of this social norm. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. She made a mistake, but it was accidental. She apologized and acknowledged the error. However, the roommate felt disrespected, which is valid. The key here is whether the mistake was her fault. Since she was in a hurry, had headphones on, and didn't realize the door closure meant someone was in, maybe she's not at fault. But if the standard norm is that closed doors mean occupied, then maybe she should have known. But she grew up in a different environment where doors were closed for other reasons. So the clash is between her energy-efficient habit and the social norm of privacy indicators.\n\nThe boyfriend and roommate think she's in the wrong because she didn't check properly. However, the author's intention wasn't to be rude. So is intent the main factor here? Or the impact? In many cases, social norms prioritize the impact over intent, but in this situation, the author didn't have malicious intent. However, she did cause an invasion of privacy, even if unintended. So maybe she's in the wrong because she failed to check adequately, even if it was a mistake. But if she's genuinely unaware of the social cues, is that on her? \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural expectations. If in her background, doors are closed for energy, then she might not have learned the social signal. However, in most shared living situations, it's expected that people understand that closed doors with lights on mean someone's inside. So even if she's from a different background, once she's in a new environment, she should adapt to local norms. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not making an effort to understand the social cues of her current living situation. But the mistake was accidental, and she apologized. So maybe she's not the asshole, but she made a mistake. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong. Even though it was accidental, she didn't check properly. The standard is that people expect closed doors to mean occupied, so she should have known to knock or check if someone's in there. Her excuse is that she didn't know, but once in a shared space, adapting to local norms is expected. So the answer is A.\n"
