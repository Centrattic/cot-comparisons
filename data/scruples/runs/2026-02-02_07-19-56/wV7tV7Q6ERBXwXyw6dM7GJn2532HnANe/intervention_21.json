This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves accidentally opening the bathroom door on her boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. \n\nFirst, the author had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. She noticed the first door was closed but the light was off. She assumed the bathroom wasn't occupied and proceeded to open the shower door. When she saw steam and light, she apologized and left. The roommate, however, was upset and accused her of lacking common courtesy. The author argues that in her family, closing doors for energy efficiency was standard, so it wasn't a sign people were using the bathroom. The boyfriend and roommate disagree, saying that two closed doors (with the light off) indicate someone is in there.\n\nSo, the key points here are the cultural norms versus personal habits. The author's family and background have a different interpretation of door-closing practices (energy efficiency vs. occupancy indication). The roommate and boyfriend hold a different standard where closed doors mean someone is inside. The author apologized and acknowledged her mistake, but the conflict arises from differing expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she made an honest mistake, but she did open the door without checking properly. However, her reasoning is based on her upbringing and energy concerns. The roommate's reaction is about a social norm that the author didn't know. In most social contexts, closed doors with lights off can indicate someone is inside, especially in shared living spaces. The fact that she had to open the shower door after the first door was closed might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have knocked first or waited to confirm. But since she apologized and didn't intend to be rude, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. However, the norm in most places is to assume that closed doors are occupied, so she might be in the wrong because she didn't check properly. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to consider if the mistake was due to ignorance of a common standard.\n"
