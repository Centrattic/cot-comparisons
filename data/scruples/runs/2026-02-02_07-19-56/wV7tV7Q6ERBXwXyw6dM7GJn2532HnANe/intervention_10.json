This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she accidentally opened the door to her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The key points here are her intentions, the situation, and the reactions from the roommate and her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, she had headphones on and was in a hurry to use the bathroom. She saw the bathroom door closed but the light was off. So she assumed it was empty and went to open the shower part. When she opened it, there was light and steam, so she immediately apologized and left. The roommate, however, took it as a big issue about common courtesy, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate someone is using the bathroom. The author explained that in her family and due to energy efficiency, they keep doors closed even when not in use. The roommate and her boyfriend felt she was being rude and that she \"lost\" the argument.\n\nNow, considering social norms, in many places, a closed door with the light on or off isn't a standard indicator of occupancy. However, common practice is that a closed door with the light on might suggest someone is inside. But the author's reasoning was based on energy efficiency, which is a valid point. However, she did make a mistake by not checking properly. Even if energy efficiency is a reason to keep doors closed, if someone is using the bathroom, the usual signs (like light or sound) would indicate that. She might have misinterpreted the closed door without light as unoccupied, but opening the shower door without checking further could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if accidental.\n\nThe roommate's reaction is about respect for privacy. Even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the act of opening the door when someone is in the shower is a violation of privacy, regardless of the reason. The fact that she had to be the one to explain her reasoning after the fact doesn't negate the immediate breach. The author did apologize, but the damage was done. The roommate's frustration is about the principle of privacy and respect for personal space. So, while the author's mistake was accidental, she is still in the wrong because she failed to check properly and caused an invasion of privacy, even if unintended. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate might indicate that in their social circle, this is a significant issue. \n\nHowever, the argument that the author is just ignorant of a common standard might be valid in her perspective, but social norms can vary. In many households, a closed door with the light on does indicate someone is inside. The author's explanation about energy efficiency might be a cultural or family-specific practice, but when moving into a shared living situation, adapting to the norms of that space is usually expected. The main issue is respecting the roommate's privacy, which the author compromised, even if unintentionally.\n"
