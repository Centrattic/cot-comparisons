This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she accidentally opened the door to her boyfriend's roommate's shower. She had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the door closed but light off, then opened it and saw light and steam. She apologized but the roommate was upset about common courtesy. She explained her family's habits with doors for energy efficiency, but they thought she was rude.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's at fault. The key points are: she opened a door that was closed but the light was off. Normally, if someone is in the shower, the door would be closed and the light on. But she thought closing doors was for energy efficiency. She didn't check if someone was inside, just assumed based on light. However, she immediately apologized and didn't mean to intrude. The roommate and boyfriend took it as a lack of courtesy.\n\nSo, the question is whether her action was wrong. She made a mistake in judgment about the door's status, but it was accidental. She apologized and didn't intend to be rude. However, in many social contexts, a closed door with a light on usually means someone is inside. If the light was off, maybe she should have knocked or waited. But in her case, she didn't know that norm. The roommate's reaction is about cultural differences in social norms. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, she did open the door without knowing if someone was in there. Even if the light was off, she didn't check. So perhaps she should have been more cautious. However, she didn't have malicious intent. The roommate's reaction might be overblown, but she did make a mistake. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she opened the door without confirming the room was empty. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because it was an accident and she apologized. Need to weigh both sides. In social norms, a closed door with light on usually indicates someone is there. If the light was off, maybe the room was unoccupied. But she saw light and steam after opening, which suggests the light was on. Wait, she said the first door to the bathroom was closed but light was off. Then she opened the shower door. The confusion was that the main bathroom door was closed with light off, but the shower door was open? Wait, the user wrote: \"First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam...\" So the main bathroom door was closed but light was off. She opened the shower part, saw a light (on) and steam. So the shower was in use. She might have assumed the bathroom was empty because the main light was off. But in some places, people might leave the main light off when using the shower, so the shower light is on. So she didn't check if the shower was occupied. She made an error in judgment. Her explanation about energy efficiency might not be the standard in that context. So, she's not malicious, but she did make a mistake. The roommate's reaction is about social norms. So, the answer might be A because she's in the wrong for not checking if the shower was occupied. But since it was an accident and she apologized, maybe B. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In terms of the situation, she did open the door without ensuring the room was empty. So even if accidental, it's a mistake. Therefore, she's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
