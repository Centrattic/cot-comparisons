This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The situation involves a misunderstanding about door etiquette.\n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, and saw the first door closed with the light off. She then opened the shower part, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, claiming that closed doors indicate someone is inside, especially with the light on. The author explains that in her household, doors are kept closed for energy efficiency, not necessarily to signal occupancy. Her boyfriend and the roommate agreed she was in the wrong, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are cultural/educational differences in door-closing practices. In many places, especially in the US, a closed bathroom door with the light on typically indicates someone is inside. The author's background, with a large family and energy-conscious habits, led her to close doors for efficiency, not privacy. However, when entering a shared space, especially someone else's home, following local norms is usually expected. Even if her intention was good, the outcome was an invasion of privacy, albeit accidental. The roommate's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is based on a common social norm. The author did apologize, which is good, but the initial action still breached privacy. So, while not malicious, the action was a mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't adhere to the social norm in that specific context, leading to an invasion of privacy. The answer would be A.\n"
