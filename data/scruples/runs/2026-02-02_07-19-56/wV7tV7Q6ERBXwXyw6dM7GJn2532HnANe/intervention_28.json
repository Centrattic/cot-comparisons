This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for accidentally walking into their boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The person is confused because they thought closed doors were for energy efficiency, not necessarily to indicate someone's in the bathroom. The roommate got really upset about it, calling it a lack of common courtesy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, closed doors, especially in bathrooms, are a sign that someone is inside. Even if the light is off, a closed door might still signal that it's occupied. The author mentioned that in their family, they closed doors for energy reasons, which makes sense, but maybe they didn't consider that others might interpret closed doors differently. \n\nThe roommate's reaction seems intense, but it's his personal space and privacy. The author did apologize, but the roommate felt violated. The key here is whether the author should have been aware of the social norm that a closed bathroom door means someone is inside. Even if their intention was energy efficiency, the effect still caused a privacy issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't realize the cultural norm. Maybe in some regions or cultures, closed doors aren't as associated with occupancy. But generally, in most Western cultures, a closed bathroom door is a clear indicator. The fact that the roommate is upset is valid, and the author's ignorance doesn't negate the violation of privacy.\n\nThe author does admit they were wrong in opening the door, so they took responsibility. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. The mistake was not recognizing the social cue, which could be a lapse in social awareness. Even if unintentional, it's still an invasion of privacy. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the roommate's privacy expectations. But maybe there's a middle ground where the roommate's reaction is over the top, but the author still made a mistake.\n"
