This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the bathroom door closed but the light off. She opened the shower door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying she was rude and that closed doors with the light off meant someone was in there. She explained that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. Her boyfriend and the roommate agreed she was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the core issue is the interpretation of door-closing habits. In many places, a closed bathroom door with the light on usually means someone's inside. But the author comes from a background where they closed doors to save energy, regardless of use. So she didn't realize that the closed door with the light off might mean someone was in there. She made a genuine mistake, not out of malice. She apologized, and the roommate was still upset. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she made an error in judgment based on different cultural norms. But she didn't intend to be rude. The roommate, on the other hand, might have a reasonable expectation that a closed door with the light off isn't a standard indicator. But maybe in their household, they use the light as a signal. So if the author didn't know that, it's a misunderstanding. However, once she saw the light and steam, she realized her mistake. The roommate's reaction seems harsh, but the author's action was accidental. \n\nSo the question is whether accidental misunderstanding leads to being in the wrong. If the roommate's household has different norms, maybe the author should have clarified. But she was in a hurry, had headphones on, and didn't realize. The key points are intent and whether there's a universal standard. Since there isn't, and it's a cultural difference, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She apologized and learned, so it's more of a communication issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
