This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person opened the bathroom door and found the roommate in the shower. They had headphones on, the bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they assumed it was okay to enter. The roommate was upset, thinking that closed doors and lights off don't indicate someone's in there. The author's reasoning is that in their family, they closed doors for energy efficiency.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author was in the wrong. Accidentally opening a door and seeing someone in the shower is an invasion of privacy, regardless of intent. Even if the author had a good reason for closing doors for energy, the fact remains that they entered without knowing if the room was occupied. The roommate's reaction is about respecting privacy, which is a common social norm. The author's argument is that their family's practice was different, but that doesn't negate the expectation in most social contexts that closed doors indicate privacy. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and didn't intend to invade privacy. They made a mistake based on their upbringing. But in most societies, it's standard to check if a bathroom is occupied, often by seeing if the light is on or if the door is locked. The author didn't check properly\u2014just the light being off. Steam and a light inside (if the bathroom has a window or another door) might be indicators. The roommate and boyfriend's reactions are about the social norm of respecting privacy. So, while the author didn't mean to be rude, the action did invade privacy, making them at least partially at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes), but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, but the author didn't lock the door, just closed it. So the expectation here is that closed doors can mean someone is inside. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a valid personal reason, but it doesn't override the social expectation. The mistake was in assuming the room was unoccupied without checking adequately. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated someone's privacy, even if accidentally. The answer is A.\n"
