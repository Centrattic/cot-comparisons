This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The situation is a bit of a cultural difference, I think. The author grew up in a large family where they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. The roommate, however, sees closed doors (with the light off) as a sign that someone is in the bathroom. The author had headphones on, saw a door closed but thought it was empty, then opened it and saw the shower light and steam. She apologized, and the roommate was upset about common courtesy.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the author was wrong in her actions. She didn't mean to be rude, but she did open the door when someone was in there. The roommate's perspective is that closing the door (even without a lock) signals that the room is occupied. The author's perspective is that in her household, closed doors were for energy, not occupancy. Now, in most places, especially in shared living situations, closed doors with the light off can be ambiguous. But typically, when someone is using a bathroom, they might leave the door ajar or have a sign, but there's no universal standard. \n\nHowever, the key point here is that the author opened the door without checking. The fact that she saw steam and light when she opened it suggests that the bathroom was in use. But she thought the light was off. Wait, the bathroom door was closed with the light off, but the shower area is a separate door? Maybe the main bathroom door was closed, but the shower door was open? Or maybe the bathroom has a main door and a partition for the shower. The user mentions opening the part to the shower after the first door. So the main bathroom door was closed but the light was off. She opened the shower part and saw light and steam. \n\nWait, maybe the main bathroom light was off, but the shower area has its own light on. So she thought the bathroom wasn't occupied because the main light was off, but the shower area was in use. But in shared spaces, how do people usually indicate they're using the bathroom? If the main door is closed, people might assume someone's inside. But if the light is off, maybe they think it's empty. But in reality, someone could be in the shower with the main light off. So the author's assumption might be a mistake. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is about common courtesy. He believes that closed doors and lights off mean someone is in there. The author's background is different. But in most shared living situations, it's customary to knock or check if a door is closed, especially for bathrooms. Even if the door is closed but the light is off, it's possible someone is inside (using a separate light, like in the shower area). The author did open the door without checking, which led to the situation. \n\nSo, while her intention wasn't to be rude, the action of opening the door when someone was in the shower could be seen as a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction is about the expectation of privacy and the understanding that closed doors indicate occupancy. The author's explanation about energy efficiency might be valid in her household, but in a shared living space, the norms might differ. \n\nIn this case, the author made an error in judgment by opening the door without ensuring the space was unoccupied. Even if her reasoning is based on different past experiences, the result was an invasion of privacy. The roommate's frustration is about the expectation of privacy in shared spaces. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't account for the different social norms in this situation. However, the roommate's reaction being overly harsh could be a separate issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she opened the door without confirming it was empty, leading to an accidental intrusion. Even though she apologized, the action itself was a mistake in that context.\n"
