This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. So, the situation is that they had headphones on, needed to pee, and the bathroom door was closed but the light was off. They thought maybe the bathroom was empty but decided to open the shower door, which they saw had light and steam. They said sorry and left. The roommate then made a big deal about it, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate the bathroom is occupied. The author's defense is that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not necessarily because someone was in there. They own a house and care about energy costs, so they lock doors. The roommate and her boyfriend said she was wrong and that she should know that two shut doors with the light off means someone's in there.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the main issue is the misunderstanding about the bathroom's occupancy based on door and light status. In many places, it's common to assume that if the bathroom door is closed and the light is on, someone is inside, especially if there's steam. However, the author's background is different\u2014they kept doors closed for energy reasons, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate, however, expects that a closed door with light on means someone is in there. The author didn't check for a \"do not disturb\" sign or knock, which is a common courtesy. They just assumed the bathroom was empty because the light was off initially and then opened the shower door without verifying, leading to the accident.\n\nNow, whether the author is at fault. While it was an accident, the key here is cultural or household norms. The author's approach to door-closing was for energy efficiency, which is valid, but in the context of a shared living space, the norms might differ. The roommate's expectation is that a closed door with the light on (and steam) indicates someone is in there. The author didn't account for this, leading to the intrusion. Apologizing was right, but the initial action might be seen as careless, especially since the consequences are significant (intruding on someone's privacy). However, the roommate's reaction seems exaggerated, as it was an accident and the author was genuinely sorry. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people do expect that if a bathroom door is closed and the light is on, someone is in there. The author's habit of closing doors for energy reasons might not align with this. So, the author might have made a mistake in not checking properly, but the roommate's reaction was also harsh. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate suggests that in their social circle, the norm is that closed doors with light on mean occupied. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to the common understanding in the shared living space, even if their intention was different. However, the severity of the reaction could be disproportionate. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they entered a closed bathroom (even if the light was off) and opened the shower door without checking, leading to an accidental intrusion, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. The roommate's reaction is also part of it. However, the main point is that the author's action, while accidental, was a mistake in not following the expected norm. So, maybe A is the answer, but the roommate's overreaction is also an issue. But the question is about the author's fault, not the roommate's reaction. So, the answer is A.\n"
