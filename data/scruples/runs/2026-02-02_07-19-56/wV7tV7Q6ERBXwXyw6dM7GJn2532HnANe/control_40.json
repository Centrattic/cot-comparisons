This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on, needed to go to the bathroom. The bathroom door was shut with the light off, so they assumed it wasn't occupied. They opened the door to the shower area and saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors with lights off indicate the room is occupied. The author explained their family's practice of keeping doors closed for energy efficiency, and that they didn't mean to be rude. The boyfriend and roommate thought the author was wrong, even though they apologized.\n\nSo, the key points here are about understanding social norms and communication. The author's mistake was based on a different understanding of door-closing habits. In many places, a closed door with the light off might indeed be seen as occupied, so the author might not have realized that. However, the roommate and boyfriend interpreted it differently, thinking the author was being rude by not knowing this unspoken rule.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Accidental invasion of privacy is a big deal, especially in a shared living space. Even if the author had good intentions and apologized, the act itself\u2014opening the door without knowing if it's occupied\u2014was a breach of privacy. The roommate's reaction, while possibly over-the-top, is valid because privacy is a fundamental expectation in such situations. The author's explanation about family practices doesn't negate the fact that they violated that privacy, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize and showed remorse, which is important. They also had a different cultural or family norm, which might make the situation less clear-cut. However, in a shared living situation, it's important to adapt to the norms of that environment. The author might not have been aware, but after the incident, they should have been more cautious about door status in the future.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author made a mistake by opening the door, but it was accidental. However, the expectation in a shared home is usually that a closed door with the light off is a sign to stay out. The roommate's reaction is understandable because privacy is crucial. The author's explanation is valid in terms of their background, but in this context, they should have been aware of the unspoken rule. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. But according to the AITA framework, even if it's a mistake, the act of invading privacy is a significant issue. So the answer might be A (author is the asshole), but there's nuance. However, the user wants a binary answer. Given that the author apologized and the mistake was due to different norms, maybe it's a B. But the action itself was a privacy violation, which is a big deal. I think the answer is A.\n"
