This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about accidentally opening the door on the boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. The author had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light off, then opened the shower door and saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying it's about common courtesy that closed doors mean someone's in there. The author explains that in her family, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not privacy. The boyfriend and the roommate agreed she was wrong, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the key points: She accidentally walked in, apologized immediately, and there's no indication she had malicious intent. The roommate's main issue is that closed doors with the light off are a signal that someone is using the bathroom. She didn't know that, and in her context, doors are closed for energy reasons. \n\nIn most cultures, especially in shared living situations, people do assume that a closed door means someone is inside. Even if the light is off, people might still be using the bathroom (like showering, which uses a lot of hot water and might have steam, but the light could be off if they're using the mirror or just the bathroom light isn't on). So, the assumption here is that if the door is closed, you don't open it without knocking or checking. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is about energy efficiency. However, in shared spaces, the social norm usually takes precedence over personal habits unless it's explicitly communicated. The problem here is that the author didn't check if the door was locked or if there were other signs someone was in there. Even if she thought the door was closed for energy reasons, she should have knocked or called out before entering. The fact that there was steam and light visible through the door might have indicated someone was there, but she still opened it. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is about respecting boundaries and privacy. Even if the author didn't mean it, the act of entering without checking can be seen as a breach of trust and common courtesy. The boyfriend's side is also important here. If he supports the roommate's perspective, it might affect how the situation is perceived. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize immediately and was remorseful. She didn't know the social norm in their household. But the fact remains that she didn't take the necessary steps to check if the bathroom was occupied. In most places, it's expected to knock or check for a \"do not disturb\" sign, etc. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while not malicious, did violate a common social expectation, leading to an invasion of privacy. Therefore, she is in the wrong because she didn't follow the customary check, even if her intention wasn't to be rude. The answer is A.\n"
