This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that they accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author mentions that they had headphones on, had to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, and then opened the part to the shower. When they saw a light and steam, they said sorry and shut it. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying it was a lack of common courtesy, and the boyfriend agreed.\n\nThe author explains that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, especially in a big house with many people. They own a house and care about energy costs, so they lock doors for that reason, not to indicate someone's in the bathroom. The roommate and boyfriend think that two closed doors and a light off mean the bathroom is occupied. The author apologized but the roommate kept being upset, leading the author to question if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about differing expectations. The author's habit is based on energy efficiency, while the roommate and boyfriend interpret closed doors and a light off as the bathroom being unoccupied. The author didn't realize their action was a breach of social norms in this context. They made a mistake but didn't intend to be rude, and they apologized. However, the roommate's reaction was strong, and the boyfriend supported him.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, in many places, a closed bathroom door with the light off might not be the most common indication of someone being inside, but in some contexts, people might check for the light or other signs. The author's reasoning is valid but perhaps not widely applicable. The mistake was in assuming the bathroom was empty based on the doors being closed but the light off. However, the author didn't intend harm and apologized. The roommate's reaction is about social norms and privacy expectations. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the norm in the roommate's experience is that closed doors with the light off mean it's unoccupied, then the author's action of opening the door was a mistake. However, the author's justification is based on energy efficiency, which is a different cultural norm. The problem here is a clash of norms. The author's mistake was not considering the roommate's perspective, but the roommate also might have been too harsh, given the apology. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they did open the door when someone was inside, regardless of their reasoning, they made a mistake. But considering intent and the fact that they apologized, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). Wait, but the author's reasoning is valid, but the action still led to an intrusion. However, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. Socially, people might expect that closed doors with the light on indicate someone is in. If the author misread the signs, even with good intentions, they might still be in the wrong for the intrusion, regardless of their reasoning. But if the norm in their background is different, maybe not. This is a bit tricky. The roommate and boyfriend are in their house, so maybe the local norm takes precedence. The author's energy efficiency reasoning is good, but in this shared living situation, social norms might be expected to adapt. So, the author made a mistake in judgment but not with malicious intent. But since they did the action that caused an intrusion, even if unintentional, maybe they are not in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because they should have known the local customs. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be B because the author didn't intend to be rude and apologized, but the mistake was due to a cultural difference. However, in many places, it's expected that a closed bathroom door with the light off might not be a clear indicator. Wait, in some places, the bathroom door might have a sign or a light indicator. If there's no such system, then maybe the author's approach is understandable, but if the roommate expects closed doors to mean occupied, then the author's action is a mistake. The answer depends on whether the author is in the wrong in that specific situation. The author's justification is valid but perhaps not the standard in the roommate's context. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the action of opening the door was a mistake. So, the author made a mistake but isn't necessarily the asshole. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the mistake was due to differing norms and they apologized. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because they failed to consider the roommate's expectations. I think the key is that the author's reasoning is valid but in a shared living situation, they should be aware of the house's norms. However, since the author didn't know and apologized, maybe it's not their fault. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
