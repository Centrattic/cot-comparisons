This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author accidentally opened the bathroom door on their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The author had headphones on and went into the bathroom because they needed to pee. The first door was closed but the light was off, so they assumed it was empty. Then they opened the shower door part, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset about it, saying that closed doors and lights off indicate someone's in there. The author explained their family's habits about keeping doors closed for energy efficiency and that they own a house where they do that. The roommate and the boyfriend think the author was rude and lacking common courtesy, but the author feels they made a mistake but didn't mean to be rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many Western countries, a closed door typically signals privacy and that someone is inside, especially in a bathroom. Even if the light is off, people might still be using the bathroom in different ways\u2014like taking a shower. So, the author's assumption that the door being closed with the light off meant the bathroom was unoccupied might be incorrect. The roommate's perspective is that the door being closed (even if the light is off) means someone is using the space, so opening it without checking further (like knocking) is a breach of privacy and rude.\n\nThe author's defense is that in their household, doors were closed for energy efficiency, not to signal occupancy. However, in most public or shared living situations, people don't interpret closed doors as being for energy reasons unless explicitly stated. The author might have been unaware of the social norm that a closed door indicates someone is inside. But even if the author didn't know, the roommate and boyfriend's reaction is based on their understanding of social norms. The author did apologize, which is a good step, but the action still caused discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are intention and social expectations. The author didn't intend to be rude, but their action violated a common courtesy. The roommate's reaction is about respecting privacy, which is a valid concern. The author's explanation about energy efficiency might explain their mistake but doesn't negate the social expectation of checking if a door is closed. So, even though it was an accident, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the social norm that a closed door signals privacy. The roommate's reaction is about the violation of that norm, even if it's accidental. However, the author taking responsibility and apologizing shows they are not intentionally being rude, but the mistake still occurred.\n"
