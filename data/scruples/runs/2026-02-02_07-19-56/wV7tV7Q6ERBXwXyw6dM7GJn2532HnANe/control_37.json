This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. They had headphones on, saw the bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they went to the shower part, saw light and steam, and then apologized. The roommate got upset about it, saying that if doors are shut and the light is off, it means someone is in there. The author's reasoning is that in their big family, they locked doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend and roommate disagree, saying she's rude and lacked common courtesy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are the cultural norms around door etiquette. In some places, a closed door with the light off might mean someone is using the bathroom, while in others, it could be for privacy or energy reasons. The author's background is a big household where doors are closed for efficiency, so she didn't interpret the closed door as a sign of occupancy. However, the roommate from what seems like a different cultural or societal background expected that a closed door with the light off meant someone is inside. \n\nThe author did apologize and acknowledged her mistake, but the roommate was upset. The question is whether she was wrong for not knowing the local custom. In most places, especially in shared living situations, it's standard to knock or check if a door is closed before entering, especially in a bathroom. Even if the light is off, steam coming from under the door might indicate someone is inside. The author opened the door without checking further, leading to an accidental intrusion. While she had a different upbringing, in most social contexts, respecting others' privacy and checking before entering a closed room is expected. The fact that the steam was visible when she opened the door suggests she could have inferred someone was there. So, even if her intention wasn't to be rude, the action was a mistake because it violated the roommate's expectation of privacy. The author's explanation might explain her actions but doesn't negate the fact that she entered without verifying, which is generally considered impolite or inconsiderate. The boyfriend and roommate's reaction is about the violation of privacy, which is a common courtesy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect the roommate's privacy, even if unintentionally.\n"
