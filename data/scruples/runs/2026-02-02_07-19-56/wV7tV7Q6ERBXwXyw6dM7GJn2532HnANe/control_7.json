This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is that the author accidentally opened the door on their boyfriend's roommate who was in the shower. The key points here are: the author had headphones on, the bathroom door was shut but the light was off, and they assumed the door being closed was for energy efficiency, not because someone was inside.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, a closed door with the light off might indeed be taken as a sign that the room is unoccupied. However, in many places, a closed door when someone is using the bathroom is a common way to signal that it's occupied. The author's reasoning is that in their family of eight, doors were kept closed for energy efficiency, which made sense. But the roommate took offense, interpreting the closed door as a sign of occupation. \n\nThe author did apologize immediately upon realizing the mistake. They also explained their reasoning, which stems from a different living situation where energy conservation was prioritized. The roommate and the boyfriend believed the author was in the wrong because they didn't recognize the closed door and light off as an indicator that someone was in the shower. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and expectations. If the roommate expected that a closed door with the light off isn't a standard indicator, but in reality, in many contexts, a closed door (regardless of the light) might be assumed to be occupied, then the author might have made a mistake. However, the author's intent wasn't malicious; it was an honest mistake, and they apologized. The roommate's reaction seems extreme given that the author didn't intentionally invade privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, if in the roommate's culture or household, a closed door is a clear signal of occupancy, then the author might be seen as not following local customs. But since the author comes from a different background where energy efficiency is prioritized, their confusion is understandable. The key here is that the author acted without malice, acknowledged the error, and apologized. The roommate's reaction, while justified in their own perspective, might be overreacting to a situation that was a genuine accident.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did what they could to correct the mistake upon realization. The roommate's insistence on the issue might be more about personal sensitivity than the actual event. So, while the author could have been more cautious, the main issue is the roommate's and boyfriend's interpretation of the situation. The author isn't in the wrong because their actions were unintentional and they took responsibility immediately.\n"
