This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was showering. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author had headphones on, needed to pee, saw the first bathroom door closed but the light off, and then opened the shower door. They saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate was upset, saying it was a matter of common courtesy. The author explained that in their family, doors are kept shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate if someone is inside. The roommate and the boyfriend thought the author was rude, but the author apologized and was genuinely sorry.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author was wrong in their actions. The author made a mistake by opening the door without checking properly, but they apologized. The roommate, however, interpreted the closed door with the light off as a sign that the shower wasn't in use. Different interpretations of social norms here. \n\nIn most Western cultures, a closed bathroom door typically signals that someone is inside, even if the light is off. The author's reasoning about energy efficiency might be valid, but when living with others, it's important to follow the household's social norms. The author's approach led to an invasion of privacy, even if unintentional. \n\nThe roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the author's actions were a breach of privacy. The key point is that the author didn't mean to be rude but still caused an issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't check properly and their explanation, while valid in their context, didn't account for the roommate's expectations, there's a case for both sides. \n\nHowever, in shared living situations, respecting others' privacy is crucial. The author's mistake was not considering that the closed door might mean someone was in the shower. Even if their energy habits are different, adjusting to the shared space's norms is necessary. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have been more cautious about privacy, even if it was an accident. But the author did apologize, so it's a bit nuanced.\n"
