This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was in the wrong for accidentally opening the bathroom door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was showering.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on and needed to pee. The first bathroom door was closed with the light off. She went to open the part that leads to the shower, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate took it as a huge issue, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in there. The author explained her family's practice of keeping doors closed for energy efficiency, which she continues in her own home. The roommate and her boyfriend disagreed, saying she lacked common courtesy.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider social norms and expectations. In many Western cultures, a closed door in a bathroom typically signals that someone is using it. If the door is closed but the light is off, some might check by looking through a peephole or knocking. However, the author didn't do that. Instead, she assumed the door was closed for energy reasons, which isn't the standard in many places. \n\nThe roommate's reaction is about privacy and respecting boundaries. Even if it was an accident, the act of opening the door without checking could be seen as a breach of privacy. While the author apologized and was sorry, the key point is whether her assumption was reasonable. In her defense, she had a different upbringing and cultural norm, but common courtesy in shared living spaces usually follows the majority's expectations. The fact that her boyfriend and the roommate agreed she \"lost the argument\" suggests that her actions were considered inconsiderate, even if unintentional.\n\nBut the author didn't intend to be rude. However, in shared living situations, it's important to be aware of and respect others' expectations, even if they differ from your own. The roommate's grievance is about the standard practice of assuming a closed door is occupied, which the author didn't follow. So, while the author's intentions were good, her actions didn't respect the roommate's expectation of privacy, making her at least partially at fault. However, since it was an accident and she apologized, some might say it's a minor issue. But the roommate's strong reaction and the boyfriend's agreement indicate that the author's actions crossed a line. \n\nWeighing both sides, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't follow the common social norm, even if unintentionally, leading to an invasion of the roommate's privacy.\n"
