This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The situation involves a misunderstanding about door usage and privacy norms.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that she had headphones on, went to the bathroom, saw the first door was shut but the light was off, and then opened the shower part. She saw light and steam, apologized, and left. Her justification is that in her family of eight, they kept doors shut for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate, however, felt that closed doors with lights off meant the room was occupied, so her action was a breach of privacy. The boyfriend agreed with the roommate.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. On one hand, she made a mistake and apologized. On the other, the roommate's perspective is that privacy norms are standard, and not respecting them is rude. The key points are: intention, cultural/educational background, and societal norms.\n\nThe author didn't mean to invade privacy, and her background influenced her actions. However, societal norms generally consider a closed door as a sign of privacy. Even if her intention was different, entering a space where someone is showering is a privacy violation. She should have knocked or checked more thoroughly. The fact that she didn't consider the other person's perspective might make her at fault. But she did apologize and didn't intend harm. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. If the roommate's norm is that closed doors mean privacy, then the author violated that. But if her upbringing taught her otherwise, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. However, since the outcome was a privacy invasion regardless of intent, the answer might lean toward her being in the wrong because she didn't account for the other person's expectations.\n"
