This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate in the shower.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, saw the first door closed but the light off, and then opened the shower door. They saw steam and light, apologized, and left. The roommate was upset about privacy, claiming that if the door was closed and the light off, it meant someone was in there. The author explains that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, which their roommate and their boyfriend took as a sign of rudeness.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many Western cultures, closed doors, especially in bathrooms, typically indicate that someone is inside and privacy is expected. However, the author comes from a background where doors are closed for energy efficiency regardless of occupancy. This is a valid reason, but it's different from the norm the roommate and boyfriend are used to. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was wrong in their actions. They did accidentally open the door, but the issue is about the interpretation of the door being closed. The author didn't intend to be rude and apologized. The problem arises from differing expectations about door closure. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they made a mistake based on their upbringing, but they didn't have malicious intent. However, in most social contexts, a closed bathroom door with steam and light on would be a clear sign someone is inside. The author might not have considered that in this specific situation, the roommate might be using the shower, which would require the door to be closed. So, while their reasoning is understandable, they might not have considered the specific context here. \n\nBut the main point is intent. The author didn't mean to be rude, just followed a family habit. However, in the roommate's perspective, a closed door meant privacy. The author's action violated that expectation, even if unintentionally. So, while the author isn't malicious, they might be in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the local social norms, even if those norms differ from their own upbringing.\n"
