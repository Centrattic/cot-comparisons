This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author had headphones on and needed to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off. She went to open the shower door, saw light and steam, said sorry, and left. The roommate got upset, saying she was rude for not understanding that closed doors with the light off mean someone's in there. The author explained that in her household, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and her boyfriend thought she was in the wrong, but she's confused because she apologized and didn't mean to be rude.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many Western cultures, a closed door with the light off does typically signal that someone is using the bathroom. However, the author comes from a different background where doors are closed for energy reasons. That's a key point. She didn't have the same understanding, which led to the mistake. \n\nBut even if it was an accident, did she have a responsibility to know the roommate's expectations? Maybe. In shared living situations, people usually adapt to each other's norms. The author might have made an error in judgment by not being aware of the common local practice. However, she did apologize, which is important. \n\nThe roommate's reaction seems a bit over the top, but the author's lack of awareness could be seen as a social faux pas. The question is whether her ignorance of a common norm makes her the asshole. Some might say she should have known, others might be more lenient given her explanation. \n\nAlso, the author's intention wasn't to be rude, but the action still caused discomfort. The roommate's perspective is valid in many contexts, but the author's explanation shows a different cultural background. It's a clash of two different social norms. \n\nIn terms of the argument, the boyfriend and roommate thought she lost, but she's trying to explain context. The key here is whether the mistake was her fault. Since she didn't intend harm and apologized, some might argue she's not the asshole. However, she could have been more cautious. Maybe opening the door without checking more thoroughly was a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate's reaction might be disproportionate. The author's explanation about energy efficiency is a valid reason for closing doors, but it's different from the norm. So it's a mix of both sides: she made a mistake due to different upbringing, but the roommate overreacted. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the mistake was her fault. Since she didn't know the local norm and acted on her own household's practices, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, in a shared living space, adapting to others' expectations is part of coexistence. So, there's a case for both A and B here. \n\nBut in the end, the question is if she's in the wrong. If \"in the wrong\" means being the asshole (AITA), then maybe the answer is B (she's not the asshole) because she apologized and it was an accident, but there's a gray area. However, some might say she should have been more aware. The community often considers intentions and reactions. Since she didn't mean to be rude and the roommate's reaction was harsh, maybe she's not the asshole. So leaning towards B.\n"
