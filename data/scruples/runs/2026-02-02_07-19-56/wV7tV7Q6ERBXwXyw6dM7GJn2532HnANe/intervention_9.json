This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate in the shower. The author explains that she had headphones on, needed to use the bathroom, and saw a door closed with the light off. She opened the shower door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate then accused her of being rude, saying closed doors indicate someone's in there. The author argues that in her family, closed doors were for energy efficiency, not privacy.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the cultural or household norm difference. The author's background is a big family where doors were closed for energy reasons, not to signify occupancy. The roommate, however, assumes that a closed door with the light off means someone is inside. The author didn't mean to intrude but made a mistake based on her upbringing. She apologized, so intent matters here. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in most contexts, people expect a closed door with the light on to mean someone's in there. Even if her reasoning was different, the action of opening the door without checking (maybe knocking?) could be seen as a breach of privacy. But she didn't realize the connotation. However, she apologized and it was an accident. The roommate's reaction might be over the top, but the mistake was hers. Maybe the author should have checked more carefully, but the situation isn't malicious. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the community norm is that closed doors mean occupied, then yes, she might be in the wrong for not adhering to that. But if she's not aware of that norm, it's more about misunderstanding rather than being an asshole. The key is whether her action was intentional. Since it was accidental and she apologized, maybe she's not the asshole. But she didn't consider the potential implications of her actions, which could be seen as a lack of common courtesy. Hmm. I think the answer is A (yes) because even if it was a mistake, she didn't follow the common understanding, causing an intrusion. However, the severity of the response might be a separate issue. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. So, yes, she is in the wrong because of the accidental intrusion, even if unintended.\n"
