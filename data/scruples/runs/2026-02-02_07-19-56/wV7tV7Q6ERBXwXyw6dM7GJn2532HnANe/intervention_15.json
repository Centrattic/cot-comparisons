This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on their boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had headphones on, needed to go to the bathroom. The bathroom door was closed but the light was off, so they opened the shower door part, saw light and steam, apologized, and walked off. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors indicate someone is in there. The author explained that in their family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The roommate and the boyfriend disagreed, saying the author was rude for not knowing the social norm.\n\nThe author is confused because they apologized and didn't mean to be rude. They argue that the closed door with the light off isn't a universal indicator. The roommate and boyfriend think the author should know that two closed doors and a light on mean someone is in there.\n\nSo, the key points here are about social norms versus personal habits. In many places, especially in private homes, when a bathroom door is closed and the light is on, it's a common signal that someone is inside. The author's family's practice was to save energy, not to indicate use. However, the social norm in many contexts is that if the door is closed and the light is on, someone is using the bathroom. The author's mistake was not recognizing this norm, leading to an accidental intrusion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author did make a mistake by opening the door without checking properly, even if it was due to different upbringing. While the intention wasn't malicious, the action still violated the roommate's privacy. The roommate's reaction might be strong, but the action was unintentional. However, the author is responsible for being aware of general social norms in shared living situations. Even if their family did things differently, in a shared space, they should adapt to common practices to respect others' privacy.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite the apology and good intentions, the action was a breach of privacy that the author should have been aware of in a shared living environment.\n"
