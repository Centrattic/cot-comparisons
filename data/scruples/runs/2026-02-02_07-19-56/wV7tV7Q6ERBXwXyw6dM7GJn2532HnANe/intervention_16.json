This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally opening the door on her boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The main issue is the interpretation of door signs indicating bathroom usage. \n\nFirst, the author had headphones on, was in a hurry to use the bathroom. The first door was closed but the light was off. She opened the shower part and saw light and steam. She apologized and left. The roommate was upset, saying that closed doors and lights off mean someone is in there. The author explains that in her family, they kept doors closed for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupancy. The boyfriend and roommate side with the roommate, saying she \"lost\" the argument.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author's actions were a mistake due to different cultural norms or if she was at fault for not adhering to the common courtesy standard. \n\nIn many Western homes, people often leave the bathroom door open if the toilet is in use but closed if the shower is in use, or use a sign. However, the author's background is different\u2014her family used doors for energy efficiency. The roommate, however, interpreted the closed door with the light off as a sign of occupancy. The author made a mistake by not checking properly, even if she apologized. However, the roommate's reaction might be too harsh if it's a cultural difference. But the fact remains that she did enter when someone was in the shower, regardless of intent. So, while she didn't mean to be rude, the action still caused an invasion of privacy. The roommate is within his right to be upset about the privacy breach, but the author's explanation might mitigate some blame. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she did accidentally invade his privacy, the answer would be that she's in the wrong, but the severity of the wrongness is debatable. The answer would likely be A.\n"
