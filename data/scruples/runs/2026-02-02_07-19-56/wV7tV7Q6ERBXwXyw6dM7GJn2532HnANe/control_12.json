This isnt a shitpost, I'm just so baffled.\n\n I had headphones on. Had to pee. First door of bathroom was shut, but light was off. Went to open the part to the shower and when I did, saw a light and steam and said sorry and shut it and walked off. He came out and made this huge deal about common courtesy if doors are shut. I simply said that I was sorry and that in my family (I grew up in a house of 8 with grandparents, aunt and cousin, ect) that we locked our doors because it was more efficient energy wise to keep doors shut. I still do this. Everyone I know keeps doors shut to keep down energy cost when its cold, it is not an indication of occupation. I own my own house and pay all my bills, so energy efficiency is a big deal to me. He kept going on about how I was rude and laughing at me stating that only people who are rude with no common courtesy lock doors. I repeated that I was wrong for opening it, but that it wasnt because I meant to be rude. He seriously went on and on about how if i had common courtesy I'd know two shut doors (and the light off) meant someone is in there.\n\nAm i the asshole? Is this something I'm just completely ignorant to? I mean, I apologized, and really was sorry, I will know for the future... but he truly believed I was the asshole for not understanding this in the first place. My bf agreed with him. They both said I \"lost\" the argument, which I wasnt trying to win, only explain that I didnt mean to be rude... it's just not as common of a standard as they think. But is it and I'm just the weird one?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author accidentally walked into the boyfriend's roommate while he was in the shower. The author had headphones on, was in a hurry to pee, saw the bathroom door closed with the light off, then opened the shower door, saw light and steam, apologized, and left. The roommate made a big deal about it, saying that doors being closed with the light off indicate someone is in there. The author's explanation is that in her family of eight, they closed doors for energy efficiency, not to indicate occupation. She apologized, but the roommate and her boyfriend thought she was being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about social norms and misunderstandings. In many places, a closed bathroom door with the light off might be assumed to be unoccupied, especially if the light is off. However, the author comes from a different background where closing doors is for energy efficiency. The author made a mistake but immediately apologized. The roommate, on the other hand, felt disrespected and thought the author ignored social cues. The author isn't malicious; she just had a different understanding. The question is whether her actions, though mistaken, are considered rude.\n\nSocial norms can vary, but in most cases, walking into someone's shower is a privacy issue. However, the author didn't intend to be rude and corrected her mistake. The roommate's reaction might be overblown, but the act of entering the shower, even accidentally, could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author's intention matters here. She didn't mean to invade privacy, just made a mistake. The roommate's response of making a big deal about it might be excessive. The boyfriend agreeing with the roommate complicates things, but the author's apology and explanation are key factors. The main issue is whether the author's mistake, despite her intentions, was inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a mistake, she acted immediately to correct it and apologized. However, the act of opening the door to the shower, regardless of intent, could be seen as a privacy violation. The roommate's reaction is valid in terms of social norms, so the author might be considered in the wrong, but the severity is low. The answer depends on whether the context of her upbringing and energy efficiency is considered a valid reason. But in general social standards, entering a shower that's closed with the light off might be expected to be unoccupied, so the author's action, even if accidental, could be seen as a breach. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
