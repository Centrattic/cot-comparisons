My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of their mom's unpaid child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now, the dad's dad died, left him money, and the mom sued the dad for past child support, getting $500k. The author feels that money was meant for them and wants a share, but the mom won't give it. The author thinks they're entitled to some, but the mom called them selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the legal and moral aspects of child support. Legally, child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to support the child. Once the child is an adult, any past child support is typically considered the custodial parent's money. But the author is arguing that since the mom didn't provide much, maybe the money should go to the kids now.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal precedent where children can claim past child support directly. Generally, once the child is emancipated (adult), the custodial parent owns the child support. However, some states might have laws allowing children to claim it under certain conditions. But the mom was awarded the money through the lawsuit, so legally it's hers. \n\nMoral arguments: The author feels entitled because the money was intended for their support. The mom used it to cover her own needs, but the kids had a deprived upbringing. However, the mom had legal custody and was supposed to use the support for the children's needs. If she didn't, that's a different issue, but legally, she might still be the one who received the money. \n\nThe author's argument is that since the mom didn't use the child support properly, the kids should get some now. But legally, once the money is paid to the custodial parent, it's their discretion. The mom's lawsuit was about enforcing the dad's legal obligation, which she did, but the outcome left the dad with nothing. The author's claim is more about the mom's use of the money rather than the legal entitlement. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't entitled to the money because it's already awarded to the mom. Morally, it's a gray area. The mom's misuse of child support could be a separate issue, but the author is now trying to claim it after the fact. The answer likely hinges on legal ownership versus ethical feelings. Since the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" and if the answer is based on typical legal standards, the answer would be B (No), but if it's about morality, maybe A. But the community's take on AITA (Am I the Asshole) might be more about social norms. However, the user wants a legal/moral answer. The mom was awarded the money, so the author can't claim it legally. The author's entitlement is based on the belief that it's for their benefit, but legally, it's the mom's. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but wait, maybe the author is in the wrong because they can't claim it once the legal process is done. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). If the author is not legally entitled, but feels they are, then maybe the author is wrong. But in the context of AITA, sometimes the answer is based on social norms rather than strict legality. But the user is asking for an analysis. So if the author has no legal claim, but the answer is whether they are in the wrong morally. If the mom kept the money after not providing, maybe the author is justified. But the author is an adult now, and the money was for their upbringing. The mom was the legal guardian, so she had the right to the money. So the author's claim is invalid legally, but maybe morally, they have a point. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal entitlement, then the author isn't entitled, but if it's about morality, maybe they are justified in feeling so. The answer likely depends on the perspective. In AITA threads, the community often considers both legal and moral aspects. Since the mom was awarded the money legally, the author's claim is unfounded, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the mom misused the funds. But I think the correct answer here is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for feeling entitled, but the legal ownership is with the mom. However, the answer could be A if the author is wrong to claim it now. Hmm, this is tricky. I need to check if there's any legal basis for the author to claim the money. In most jurisdictions, once child support is paid to the custodial parent, it belongs to them. So the author is not entitled to it. Therefore, the author's belief that they are entitled is incorrect, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they are wrong in their belief, but not in the wrong for feeling that way, then the answer might be No (B). Alternatively, if the author is wrong in believing they have a right to the money, then they are in the wrong. It's a bit of a nuance. But given the scenario, the author is not in the wrong for feeling entitled, but legally they have no claim. So answer B.\n"
