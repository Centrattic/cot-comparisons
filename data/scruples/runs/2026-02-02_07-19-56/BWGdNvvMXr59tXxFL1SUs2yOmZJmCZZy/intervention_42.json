      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a person whose mom got a large sum of money from their dad through a court award for unpaid child support. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking they should get some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how child support works. Child support is money that a non-custodial parent pays to the custodial parent or guardian to help cover the costs of raising their children. It's typically used for the child's benefit, but it's given to the parent to manage. So in this case, the dad was supposed to pay child support to the mom, but he stopped because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now, the mom is getting that money back, which was unpaid, from the dad after he inherited money from his dad.\n\nThe author argues that since the money was intended for them as children, they should get a share. The mom, however, is keeping it all and not sharing. The author feels entitled to some of it because during their childhood, the money was supposed to support them, even though the mom used it for the bare minimum. The mom is now refusing to share, calling the author selfish.\n\nSo, legally, who owns the child support money? I think child support is considered the property of the child until they reach majority. Once the child is an adult, the money might belong to them, but there could be complications if it was given to the custodial parent. If the mom received the child support during the kids' childhood, those funds would have been for their benefit. However, if the dad made payments after the kids turned 18, that would be different. But in this case, the money in question is unpaid child support from when the kids were minors. The mom is now getting that back from the dad, which was a court-ordered payment. \n\nBut here's the twist: the dad stopped paying because the mom was limiting visitation. That could affect his liability. Maybe the court considered that in awarding the unpaid support. Now, the mom is getting the money from the dad, but the author is an adult and wants a share. The key point is whether the mom has any obligation to share that money with the children once it's awarded to her. \n\nLegally, child support is intended for the child's benefit, but once the money is paid to the custodial parent, it's usually considered their money to use for the child's needs. However, if the parent is keeping it for themselves instead of using it for the child, that could be a different situation. But in this case, the child support was unpaid during the children's childhood, and now the mom is getting it back. The author is an adult now, so maybe they don't have a claim. However, if the money was rightfully intended for the children, maybe they do have a claim. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The mom was the one who received the money from the court, but she used the funds for the bare minimum. The author might feel that since the money was supposed to support them, they should get some of it now. But the mom might argue that she had the right to use the child support as she saw fit, especially since it was during their childhood. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's a concept called \"quasi-torts\" where if someone receives money that was intended for a child but misuses it, the child might have a claim. However, this is complicated and depends on local laws. The author's position might have some legal merit if they can argue that the mom misused the funds. However, if the mom received the child support during the children's minority, she might have the right to manage it as she saw fit, even if it wasn't lavish. \n\nAnother angle is that the court awarded the money to the mom for the unpaid support. If that's the case, then the money legally belongs to her now. The author might not have a legal claim to it, but ethically, they might feel entitled. The answer might depend on whether the question is legal or ethical. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is a moral question. \n\nIf we consider that the money was meant for the children's support and the mom didn't provide anything extra, maybe the author is justified in feeling they should get some. However, the mom is the legal guardian, and once the money is given to her, she's not obligated to share it unless there's a legal claim. The author may not have a legal claim, but ethically, it's debatable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be in the wrong ethically (since the money was intended for their benefit), legally, the mom might have the right to keep it. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so from a moral standpoint, maybe not. But the answer depends on the context. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, and given the information, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
