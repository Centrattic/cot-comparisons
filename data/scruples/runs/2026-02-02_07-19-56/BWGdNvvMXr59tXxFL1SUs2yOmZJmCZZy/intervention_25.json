My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom got $500k from the dad for unpaid child support, and now the author wants some of that money. The author argues that the money was supposed to support the kids, so they should get a share. But the mom is keeping it all.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help support the child. So in this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent because the kid lived with the mom. If the dad stopped paying child support, the mom could get a court to order him to pay the arrears. The money is awarded to the custodial parent, right? So legally, it belongs to the mom as the recipient. The author is now an adult, so the child support obligation would have ended when the author turned 18. The money was back payments for the time the author was a minor. \n\nBut the author is saying the money was intended for them, so they should get some of it. But legally, the custodial parent has the right to that money. The author's mom could have used that money for the child's needs, but that's up to her. The author is now adult and the money is in her possession. The author is arguing that since the purpose was to support the kids, they should get a share. But from a legal standpoint, the author isn't entitled to it. The court orders the money to the custodial parent. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel it's unfair because their mom kept them in poverty, but the law doesn't necessarily recognize that. The author's mom might have spent the money as she saw fit, even if it was minimal. The author is now trying to claim it after the fact, which might be too late. \n\nAlso, the author's dad got money from his father, but the mom sued for the unpaid support instead of taking that money. The author is upset that the dad has nothing left. But the court's decision was to award the money to the mom, so maybe the dad's assets are separate. \n\nSo legally, the author isn't entitled to the money. The mom has the right to keep it. The author's argument is more ethical or emotional rather than legal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they don't have a legal claim to the funds once they were awarded to the mom. The answer would be A.\n"
