My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom getting a large sum from her ex-husband's child support, which was unpaid because the mom didn't let the dad see the kids. Now the mom is keeping the money, and the kids want some of it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is supposed to support the children, but in this case, the father stopped paying because the mother blocked his visitation. Legally, if a parent denies visitation, can the other parent stop child support? I think in some jurisdictions, you can petition to modify child support if visitation rights are denied, but cutting off support entirely might not be the right approach. However, the mom then sued for the unpaid child support and got a $500k payout.\n\nNow, the kids want a share of that money. The mom was awarded the money by the court, which might mean it's her property now. But the kids argue that the original intent was for their support. Legally, once the court awards the money to the mother, it's likely her asset. However, there might be exceptions if the kids can prove they were the intended beneficiaries. But courts usually treat child support as the custodial parent's responsibility to use for the child's benefit, even if they're not directly distributing it.\n\nEthically, the mom provided the bare minimum, so the kids feel entitled. But the mom had legal rights to the child support, and the court's decision might have been based on the father's obligation. The father's cut-off of support might have been a breach of duty, but the mother then collected it. The kids' claim now is complicated because the money is already awarded to the mother. Unless there's a way to contest the court's decision or show that the mother misused funds, the kids might not have a legal leg to stand on. However, ethically, some might argue that the money should go to the children since that's its purpose. But legally, the mother is the recipient until proven otherwise. So, the author's position might be ethically understandable but legally unfounded. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because the money is awarded to the mother, and the kids can't claim it without legal grounds.\n"
