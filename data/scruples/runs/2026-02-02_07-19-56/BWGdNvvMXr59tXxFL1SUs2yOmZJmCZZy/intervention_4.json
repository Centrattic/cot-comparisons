My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding their mother receiving money from their father's inheritance and then being awarded it as unpaid child support. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to support them as kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's needs. In this case, the father was the non-custodial parent, but he stopped support because the mother wouldn't let him see the kids. Then, when the grandfather left money to the dad, the mom sued and got a $500k award for unpaid child support. Now the author believes they should get some of that money since it was for them.\n\nLegally, once the court awards the unpaid child support to the mother, it becomes her property. The author might not have a legal claim to it because the court's decision was in favor of the mother. However, morally, the author might feel that the money was intended for them, especially since the child support was supposed to support their needs. The mother kept it all, which could be seen as selfish if she was the one receiving it as part of the court decision.\n\nBut the key here is the legal versus moral argument. Legally, the author probably isn't entitled to it. Morally, they might feel they are, but that doesn't mean they have a legal right. The mother's actions in suing and getting the money were through legal means, so the author's claim might not hold up in court. However, the situation is complex because the money came from the father's inheritance, and the mother used it to settle past child support, which was a legal obligation. The mother isn't required to share it with the kids unless there's a specific agreement or court order.\n\nThe author's perspective is about feeling entitled because the child support was meant for them. But once the money is awarded to the mother, it's her asset. Unless there's a legal mechanism to claim it, the author might not have a case. The mother might have had the right to keep it as per the court's decision. So, from a legal standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they don't have a claim to that money. Morally, it's a different story, but the question is about right or wrong in the situation, which usually refers to legal standing. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
