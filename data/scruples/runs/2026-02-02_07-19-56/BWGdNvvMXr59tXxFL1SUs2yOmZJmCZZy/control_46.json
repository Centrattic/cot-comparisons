My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about a mom getting a large child support payment from the dad, and the kids want some of it.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then, when the dad's dad left him money, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the mom isn't sharing any of it with the kids. The author feels entitled to some of it since it was for their support.\n\nHmm. Legally, child support is the money the parent (dad) is supposed to give to the custodial parent (mom) for the kids' care. If the mom isn't using it properly, does that change anything? The author is saying that since the money was for the kids, they should get some now. But once the court awards the unpaid support to the mom, is it her property? Or is it still considered the kids' money?\n\nI need to think about legal ownership. Usually, child support is paid to the custodial parent to care for the child. If the parent misuses the funds, the child might have a claim, but once the support is paid, it becomes the custodial parent's income. However, in this case, the mom sued for unpaid support, which is a legal action to recover what was owed. So the court awarded it to her, which would make it her money now. The kids might not have a legal claim to that money unless there's a specific law saying otherwise.\n\nBut the author's argument is that the money was intended for their support. However, once the support is paid, it's up to the custodial parent how to use it. If the mom didn't use it for their benefit, maybe there's a moral argument here, but legally, they might not have a right to it now. The mom isn't a bad person, but she did get the money through the court, so the author might be in the wrong for thinking they can claim it now.\n\nAlso, the dad stopped paying support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. That's a separate issue. The dad's decision to stop payments might have been wrong legally, but the mom is now taking action to get that money, which is now hers by court ruling. The kids' entitlement is a stretch if the money is the mom's now.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the money was legally awarded to the mom, and the kids don't have a claim to it. The author's moral stance doesn't override the legal ownership. The mom isn't obligated to share it unless there's a court order, which there isn't.\n"
