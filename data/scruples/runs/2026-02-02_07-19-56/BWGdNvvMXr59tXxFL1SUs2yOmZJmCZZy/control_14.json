My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author says their dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more often. The dad wanted more time, but the mom was blocking it, so he cut off support. Then, the dad's father recently passed away and left him a lot of money. However, the mom sued the dad for the unpaid child support and got $500k awarded, which left the dad with almost nothing from his inheritance. The author feels that since this money was for the kids' support, they should get some of it now, even though they're adults. The mom refuses and calls the author selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to this money. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles.\n\nLegally, child support is typically paid to the custodial parent (the mom in this case) to support the children. Once the money is paid, it's up to the parent how they use it. So if the dad stopped paying because of the mom's actions, that's a separate issue. Now, when the mom sues later and gets a judgment against the dad, that judgment is a legal claim against him. She got the money from the dad's inheritance, which might be a point of contention, but legally, the court awarded it to her. However, the author is now an adult and the money was for their support when they were minors. The problem is, once the child support is paid, it's not a direct asset of the child anymore. So legally, the author might not have a claim to the money once it's in the mom's possession.\n\nEthically, it's a different story. The author's argument is that the child support was intended to support them, so they should get some of it now. The mom is keeping it, even though she provided minimal care. But ethically, once the money was given as child support, the custodial parent is supposed to use it for the children's benefit. However, if the mom used it poorly (like not taking them on trips or buying unhealthy food), that's a judgment call. But the author is now asking for the mom to share the money after the fact. Since the money was already paid out as child support, and the mom has legal ownership now, the author might not have a legal claim, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might feel entitled because the money was meant for them, but the mom could argue that she used it to cover the basics, even if it wasn't ideal.\n\nAnother angle: the dad's inheritance being used to pay child support. The author might be upset that the dad's inheritance was taken to pay the mom. But the dad didn't pay the support, so the court ordered him to pay, using his inheritance. The author's dad might have legal issues here, but the author's stance is about the money already taken as a judgment. The author's entitlement is based on the idea that the money was for their childhood needs, but once it's paid, it's the mom's to spend as she sees fit.\n\nSo, legally, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but ethically, the mom's refusal might be seen as selfish. However, the key is whether the author has a legal right to that money now. Since the child support was paid and the mom has it, the author doesn't have a legal claim. But emotionally, the author is justified in feeling wronged, especially if the mom used the funds inadequately. The question is if the author is in the wrong for thinking they should get some. Since the author isn't legally entitled, but ethically might feel justified, the answer might depend on the perspective. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, even if they can't legally claim it.\n"
