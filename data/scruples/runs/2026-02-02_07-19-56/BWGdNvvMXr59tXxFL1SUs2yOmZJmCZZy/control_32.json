My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some or all of their mom's unpaid child support.\n\nSo the situation is that the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now the dad got money from his dad's estate, and the mom sued for the unpaid child support, getting $500k. The author thinks the money should be shared with the kids since it was supposed to support them. But the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom was blocking visitation, that might affect the legal case. But the mom got a judgment for the unpaid support. Legally, once that support is awarded, it's the custodial parent's money, right? So the mom might have a legal right to keep it. But the author is arguing that the money was meant for the kids, so they should get some of it now.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom provided the bare minimum, which is what child support is supposed to cover. But the author is an adult now, so maybe the argument is that the money was owed during their childhood, and now the mom is keeping it. But if the child support was legally hers, she can do with it as she wants unless there's a court order otherwise. The author's claim might be more about moral entitlement rather than legal rights.\n\nSo legally, the mom has the money. The author's argument is based on the idea that the money was for the kids, but once it's paid to the mom, it's hers. The author might not have a legal claim, but maybe there's a moral expectation. However, the mom might not feel obligated to share it. The author is upset because the money was supposed to support them, but they're adults now and the support was paid when they were minors.\n\nSo the author's position could be seen as not in the wrong because they're questioning the fairness of the situation. The mom took legal action to get the money, but keeping it all might not be legally required to share with the kids. The author's entitlement is based on the original intent of child support, but once it's awarded, it's up to the parent. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but more on the moral side rather than legal. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so if the author is claiming a right they don't have, maybe they are in the wrong. But the question is about entitlement, which might be more about the author's feelings than actual legal rights. So the answer is B.\n"
