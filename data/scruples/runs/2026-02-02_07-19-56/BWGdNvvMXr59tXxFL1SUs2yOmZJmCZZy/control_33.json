My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for thinking they're entitled to their mom's unpaid child support. The situation is that the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now the dad got money from his dad's estate, and the mom sued for the unpaid child support, got $500k, and isn't sharing it with the kids. The author feels entitled to some of it because the child support was supposed to support them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is meant to support the child, but once it's paid to the parent, it's usually their money. However, in this case, the child support was unpaid, and the mom sued to get it. The $500k is a judgment against the dad for the unpaid support, so it's a legal debt owed to the mom. So legally, the mom now has that money, and it's hers to do with as she wishes, unless there's a court order requiring her to use it for the kids' benefit. But once it's in her possession, unless there's a specific reason to split it, she's not obligated to share it with the kids.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author argues that the money was intended for the kids, so they should get some. But the mom took legal action to claim it, and the court awarded it to her. The kids might feel entitled, but the legal process has already transferred ownership to the mom. The mom might have her reasons for keeping it, maybe for her own needs or to save, but the kids aren't part of that decision anymore.\n\nAlso, the dad cutting off child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids is a separate issue. The mom suing the dad for unpaid support is a legal matter, and the outcome is that the dad has to pay it to the mom. The kids' current entitlement to that money isn't recognized legally in this scenario. The mom's refusal to share it could stem from her own grievances or financial needs.\n\nThe author's position is that the money was originally for the kids, so they should get some. But once the court awarded it to the mom, it's her property. Unless there's a legal requirement for her to distribute it to the kids, which there isn't, she isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The author might feel wronged, but their claim isn't legally valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, because their moral stance is understandable, but the legal situation doesn't support their entitlement. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's belief that they deserve some of the money isn't wrong morally, but legally, they have no claim. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), the correct answer would be B because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled based on the intended purpose of child support, even though the legal outcome is different. The mom's decision to keep it is her choice once she's been awarded the money.\n"
