My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mom getting a large sum from unpaid child support from their dad, and the author wants a share of it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's upbringing. Once the child becomes an adult, the support typically stops. The mom received the money through a court ruling, so legally, it's hers unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nThe author argues that the money was intended for them and their siblings. But legally, once the child is emancipated (turns 18), the support isn't something they can claim. The mom was the one receiving the payments, so she has the legal right to the money unless she had a prior agreement with the dad to distribute the funds to the kids. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author feels entitled because the money was for their upbringing, but the mom spent it during their childhood. Since she's using the money now, it's a matter of her discretion. The author's argument that the money should be shared now because it's for their benefit might not hold up legally, as the support period has passed. The mom isn't obligated to give it to them unless there's a court order or agreement. \n\nAlso, the dad cutting off support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids might complicate things, but the court's ruling on unpaid support is final. The author's claim might be seen as trying to benefit from a past financial obligation that's already been addressed. \n\nSo, considering the legal standpoint and the fact that the author is now an adult, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. The money was legally awarded to the mom, and she isn't required to share it with her adult children unless there's a specific arrangement. Therefore, the author's entitlement might be a moral argument but not a legal one.\n"
