My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong regarding their mother taking their father's inheritance and using it as unpaid child support.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The author's dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now, after the dad's dad dies and leaves money, the mom sued and got $500k as unpaid child support, leaving nothing for the dad. The author thinks they should get some of that money, but the mom isn't sharing it. The author feels entitled because child support is supposed to be for the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are: child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the children's benefit. When the dad cut off support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, maybe there was a legal aspect there. But the mom later obtained the unpaid child support through legal means. Now the question is, does the child have a claim to that money?\n\nI remember that in many jurisdictions, child support is considered the custodial parent's responsibility to use for the children's needs. So even if the parent sues the non-custodial parent, the funds are usually considered part of the child's support and managed by the custodial parent. However, if the custodial parent isn't using it properly, there might be issues, but that's more about the parent's responsibility than the child's right.\n\nIn this case, the author is an adult now, so the child support would have ended when they turned 18. The mom is using the money she received from the lawsuit, which was for past support. Since the author is no longer a minor, they might not have a legal claim to that money. The mom is the one who was awarded it through the court, so she has the right to manage it unless there's a specific arrangement stating otherwise.\n\nThe author's argument is based on the idea that the money was \"intended for them\" as kids. But legally, once the child is an adult, the court's decision to award that money to the mom would likely be final. The mom's decision not to share it with the adult children isn't necessarily wrong because she's using her legal victory, even if the children feel it's unfair.\n\nAlso, the mom's reasons for keeping it\u2014like her bare minimum upbringing\u2014might not legally justify sharing it now. The court's award was based on the past period when the children were minors, and the parent has discretion over that money unless there's a court order otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're asserting a claim to money that was legally awarded to their mother, and as an adult, they don't have a legal entitlement to it. The mother's actions, while perhaps stingy, are within her rights according to the court's decision.\n"
