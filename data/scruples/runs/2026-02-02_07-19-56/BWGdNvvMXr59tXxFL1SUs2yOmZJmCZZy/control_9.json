My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom taking the child support money from their dad.\n\nFirst, the background: The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now, the dad's dad left him money, but the mom sued and got $500k in unpaid child support. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it's supposed to support the kids, but the mom isn't giving it to them. The author's argument is that the money was originally for them as children, and now it's being kept by the mom.\n\nSo, legal perspective first. Child support is meant to support the child, right? So if the mom received it as a guardian, she's supposed to use it for the child's benefit. But once the child is 18 or older, the support obligation usually ends. The author is an adult now, so the money might be considered the mom's, unless the court specified it should be given to the children later. But the mom sued after the author was already an adult, so maybe the court's decision was a retroactive claim. \n\nLegally, if the mom was awarded the money as a guardian, she might have the right to keep it, but there's an ethical angle. The author feels the money was supposed for them, especially since it was for their childhood. However, the mom is the one who received the judgment, so unless there's a specific order to distribute it to the children, she might not have to. \n\nEmotionally, the author's frustration is understandable. They had a tough upbringing and now the mom is keeping a large sum meant for their support. But legally, unless there's a court order stating the children are entitled to the money, the mom might be within her rights. \n\nAlso, the dad's situation is a bit of a red herring. He stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. The court's decision was based on his non-payment, but the author is focusing on the mom keeping the payout. The author's claim is about their entitlement, not the dad's actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong morally for feeling they deserve some of the money, but legally, the mom might have a right to keep it since she was the one awarded it. The court didn't specify that the children would get it later. Therefore, the author's position is based on an ethical argument rather than legal entitlement. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not legally entitled, but ethically, they feel they are. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author is assuming a legal right they don't have, then they might be in the wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether they have a legal claim. The author is in the wrong if their claim is invalid. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong because the money was awarded to the mom, and the author doesn't have a legal claim to it. But the author's argument is emotional and ethical, not legal. So the answer is A or B?\n\nHmm. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The answer depends on whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled. If the law doesn't support their entitlement, then they are in the wrong for thinking they are. But if the court's decision was to give the money to the mom, then the author is wrong to expect it. But maybe the court's decision was to collect the unpaid support, which was owed to the children when they were minors. If the mom took the money as owed to her (as the custodial parent), but the support is for the children, then perhaps the children should get it. But this is a gray area. Different jurisdictions might handle this differently. Without specific laws, it's hard. But generally, child support is paid to the custodial parent for the child's benefit. Once the child is an adult, any unpaid support is owed to the parent, not the child. So the author isn't entitled. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for thinking they are. So answer A.\n"
