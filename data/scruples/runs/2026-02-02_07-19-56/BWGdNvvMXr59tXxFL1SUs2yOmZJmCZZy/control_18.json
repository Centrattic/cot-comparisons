My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their mom collecting unpaid child support from their dad, who had stopped paying because the mom wouldn't allow him to see the kids more. Now the mom got $500k from that, and she's not sharing it with the kids. The author feels entitled to some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent (the dad) to the custodial parent (the mom) to help cover the child's needs. Once the child is an adult, the support usually stops. In this case, the author is now an adult, so the child support was unpaid while they were minors. The mom received a lump sum for the unpaid support, but the author is asking if they can get some of that money now.\n\nLegally, the child support was owed to the parents for the children's upkeep. Once the money is received by the parent, it's their property unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. The author might not have a legal claim to the money now that they're adults. So, legally, the author might not be entitled to it.\n\nBut morally, the author argues that the money was supposed to support the kids. The mom provided only the bare minimum, which the author feels wasn't sufficient. The author might believe they deserve a share because the money was intended for them. However, the mom is the legal recipient, and she's not obligated to share it unless there's a family agreement or court order. \n\nThe author's mom might have had the right to keep the money as per the court decision. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they feel their needs weren't met, but the money was compensation for past support owed. The mom's decision not to share it is within her rights unless there's a specific legal requirement for distribution to the children.\n\nSo, in terms of legal responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, but they might not have a valid legal claim. The mom is within her rights to keep the money. The answer depends on whether we're looking at it from a legal or moral standpoint. The question asks if the author is in the wrong, so considering legal aspects, the answer would be B (No), because they're not legally in the wrong for their feelings, but they might not have a valid claim. The mom is not obligated to share the money, so the author's entitlement isn't supported legally, but they aren't at fault for feeling that way.\n"
