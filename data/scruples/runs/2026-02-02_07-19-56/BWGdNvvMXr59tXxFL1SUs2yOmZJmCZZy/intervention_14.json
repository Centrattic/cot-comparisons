My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a mom suing her ex-husband for unpaid child support after he stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see their kids. The dad then got a large inheritance from his father, and the mom used that to get a $500k judgment. Now the author (kid) wants some of that money, but the mom won't share it. The kid feels entitled because the child support was supposed to support them, and the mom is keeping it all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is a court-ordered payment meant to support the child's needs. When the dad stopped paying, that was a violation unless there was a legal reason. The mom's decision to sue for unpaid child support after the dad's dad's death might be legally justified if the court agreed that the dad was in arrears. Once the court awards the money to the mom, it becomes her property, right? So legally, the mom might have the right to keep it now that the case has been resolved. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The kid is arguing that the money was intended for their support, so they should get a share. But legally, once the support is awarded, it's the custodial parent's responsibility to use it for the child's benefit. However, if the parent isn't sharing it now that the child is an adult, that's different. But the court decision would have been based on the child's needs during the time the support was owed. The money is a judgment against the dad, not a direct grant to the children. \n\nThe mom's actions\u2014using the inheritance (which is now the dad's) to pay back child support\u2014might be legal. The dad's inheritance is separate from the child support arrears. The mom's lawsuit could have been a way to enforce the dad's legal obligation, even if he used his father's money to pay it. \n\nNow, the kid's entitlement. Since the child support was paid (or in arrears) for their upbringing, but the money was awarded to the mom, the kid has no legal claim to it now. The mom may have the right to keep it as the recipient of the judgment. However, the kid might feel it's unfair, but that's a moral stance. Legally, the author might be in the right if they argue that the money was meant for them. But legally, once the mom received it, it's hers unless there was an agreement to share. \n\nLooking at the mom's behavior: she provided the bare minimum, didn't take the kids on trips, etc. The kid might feel they're owed because the support wasn't used well. But the court's decision was based on the child's needs at the time, not how the mom spent it afterward. The mom might have been using the support for basic needs, which is what it was intended for. \n\nSo the author is arguing that the money should now be shared with the kids. But legally, the mom has the right to the judgment money. The author's claim is more of a moral argument rather than a legal one. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they have no legal standing to claim the money. The mom isn't obligated to share it, even if she used it to pay for basic needs in the past.\n"
