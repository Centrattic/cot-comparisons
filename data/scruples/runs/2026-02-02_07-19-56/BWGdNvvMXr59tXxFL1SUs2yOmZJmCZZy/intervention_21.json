My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a mom suing her ex-husband for unpaid child support, getting a $500k payout, and then not sharing it with the kids. The author is upset because they think that money was supposed to be for them and should be shared now.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the laws around child support. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent to cover the child's needs. Once the child is an adult, the support usually stops. So, the money was paid to the mom when the kids were minors. Now that they're grown, does that money belong to them or the mom?\n\nFrom what I know, child support payments are considered the property of the custodial parent once they receive them. The purpose is to support the child's upbringing, but once the child is grown, the parent can use that money as they see fit. So the mom getting the $500k is essentially a settlement for past unpaid support, not a direct payment to the children. Therefore, she's within her rights to keep it.\n\nThe author argues that the money was \"intended for me,\" but legally, once the support was unpaid and later awarded, it's a debt that's settled through the courts. The court awarded the money to the mom because she was the one who had custody and was supposed to be the beneficiary of the support. The children aren't direct recipients of the child support; the parent is.\n\nAlso, the mom is not obligated to share the settlement with her adult children. The author's argument might be based on the intention of child support, but the legal framework doesn't necessarily support that the children have a claim to past support payments once they're adults. So the mom isn't doing anything wrong by keeping the money. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally, there's no entitlement. \n\nThe mom's actions here are within her legal rights, so the author is in the wrong for expecting to get a share of that money. The answer should be A.\n"
