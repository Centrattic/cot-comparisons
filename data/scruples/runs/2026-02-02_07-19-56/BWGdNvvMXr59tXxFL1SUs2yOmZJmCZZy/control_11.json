My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of their mom's unpaid child support. The situation is that the mom sued the dad and got $500k for unpaid child support, which the dad received from his father's inheritance. The mom didn't provide much beyond basics, and now she's keeping the money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's upbringing. In this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, cutting off support because the mom wouldn't let him spend more time. Now, the mom is getting a lump sum from the dad for back child support. Legally, that money is meant to compensate for the support the kids were entitled to during the time the dad was paying. So even if the dad inherited money, the court award is to the mom because she was the one who received the child support (as the custodial parent). The author is now an adult, so the support is no longer active.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author feels the money was intended for them, given that it's for child support. The mom, however, might argue that the court ruled it was her due, and she's not obligated to share it. The author's reasoning is that the money should have been used for the kids' support. But legally, once the child is an adult, the support is considered a debt to the custodial parent for past services, not to the child directly. So the author might not have a legal claim, but maybe a moral one.\n\nThe mom's actions of suing for the unpaid support might be within her rights. The court decision would be based on the custodial parent's entitlement to the support. The author's argument is that the purpose of child support is to support the kids, so the money should go to them. But the actual legal framework might not support this, as the custodial parent can use the support as they see fit, even if it's not for lavish items. However, the author is now an adult, and the support was for their childhood. The question is about the author's entitlement to the money now that it's been awarded to the mom.\n\nThe answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). The author's perspective is that they should get some of the money because it was originally meant for them. The mom's perspective is that it's her money now, and she's not required to share. Legally, the mom likely has the right to keep it, but morally, it's debatable. The author might feel it's unfair, especially if the support wasn't used for their benefit. However, the legal system might not recognize that. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling entitled, but they might not have a legal or ethical obligation that others owe them. The answer would depend on the balance between legal rights and perceived moral obligations. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the legal structure, the author's claim might not hold, but the emotional aspect is there. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the entitlement feeling is understandable, even if the legal claim doesn't exist.\n"
