My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking they should get some of the $500k from their dad's inheritance, which their mom got through a child support lawsuit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is usually paid to the custodial parent, right? So even though the money is supposed to support the kids, the parent who receives it gets to decide how it's used. The dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see his kids, but maybe that's not a valid reason. However, the lawsuit was about unpaid child support, and the court awarded the mom the money. Legally, that money now belongs to her, not the kids directly.\n\nThen there's the inheritance part. The dad received money from his deceased father, but the mom was awarded the unpaid child support from that, so the inheritance was taken to settle the debt. The person is upset because they feel the money should have been theirs, especially since the support was supposed to be for them. But the child support was a legal obligation to the custodial parent, not a direct payment to the children. The mom might have a legal right to keep that money, even if she didn't use it for extravagant things.\n\nAlso, the mom didn't provide a luxurious childhood but the basics. The person is arguing that the support was meant for the children, but legally, it's a payment to the parent. The mom might have used the money for necessary expenses, like rent, utilities, or basic food, which don't leave leftovers for the kids. Even if she didn't use it for nice things, it's her responsibility as the custodial parent to allocate the funds as she sees fit.\n\nThe person's dad and they are now closer, but the child support issue was settled through the courts. The author is feeling entitled because they believe the money was intended for them, but the court's decision was to award it to the mom as compensation for the unpaid support. So the author might not have a legal claim. Morally, they might feel it's unfair, but legally, it's a different story.\n\nThe mom called them selfish and ungrateful, which could be because the child is challenging her right to the money. The author's argument hinges on the idea that child support is for the kids, but in practice, it's paid to the parent. So maybe the author is wrong in expecting the mom to share that money. The court's decision was final, and the mom is within her rights to keep it unless there's a specific legal avenue for the children to claim a share, which I don't think exists unless the child was emancipated or something. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the child support was legally owed to the mom, and the kids don't have a direct claim to it once it's awarded to her.\n"
