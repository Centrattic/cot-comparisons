My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's mom receiving a $500k payout from the dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect here. Child support is supposed to support the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him spend time with the kids, that's a family dynamic issue. But legally, once the court ordered child support, the dad was obligated to pay, and the mom was entitled to it for the kids' benefit. Now that the dad has money from his father, the mom sued and got the $500k. But the author is saying that since the money was for child support, they should get some of it.\n\nLegally, child support is a payment from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's care. So if the mom is the one awarded the money, it's up to her how she uses it. Unless there's a court order specifying that the money must be used for the children's benefit, she's the one who receives it. The author might feel entitled because the money was intended for them, but once it's paid to the mother, it's her property unless specified otherwise. So the author might not have a legal claim to the money now.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels they didn't get much support growing up, so they want that money. But the mom might have used the child support money for the kids' needs as she saw fit, even if it wasn't extravagant. The author is an adult now, so maybe they can't claim entitlement to past support. Also, the dad's decision to cut off support was his choice, but that doesn't necessarily make the mom's use of the money wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a bit tricky. The author might feel they deserve the money because it was for their support, but the mom is the legal recipient. The author's argument is based on the intent of child support, but once it's paid out as a lump sum, it's the mother's to manage. Unless there's a legal requirement for the mother to share it with the kids, she isn't obligated. The author's feeling of entitlement is more about their upbringing and financial situation, but legally and ethically, they might not have a strong case.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the money was awarded to the mother, and unless there's a specific legal requirement, they can't claim it. The author's perspective is understandable emotionally but not legally valid.\n"
