My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom getting a large sum from her ex-husband's inheritance to cover unpaid child support, and the kids feeling entitled to some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is typically a legal obligation from the parent who isn't living with the child to contribute to their upbringing. In this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, when the dad's dad left him money, the mom sued for the unpaid child support. The court awarded her $500k, which came from the inheritance. Now the kids want a share of that money, arguing it was meant for them.\n\nLegally, when child support is awarded, it's considered the custodial parent's responsibility to use it for the child's benefit. So the court's decision would be that the money goes to the mother because she had custody and was the one raising the kids. The kids might not have a legal claim to that money once it's given to the mother. However, ethically, there's a different angle. The kids feel the money was intended for their support and not just the mom. But since the mom is the one with custody, the law might not see it as something the kids can claim now.\n\nThe mom's actions\u2014taking the money and not sharing it\u2014might seem harsh, but legally, she's within her rights if the court granted her the child support. The kids' argument is more about the ethical use of the money, not the legal ownership. The author is upset because they believe the money should have gone to them for their upbringing, but once the court decided it went to the mother, she's entitled to it. The author's entitlement might be a misunderstanding of how child support works. So, the author's argument might not hold up legally or ethically, making them the one in the wrong.\n"
