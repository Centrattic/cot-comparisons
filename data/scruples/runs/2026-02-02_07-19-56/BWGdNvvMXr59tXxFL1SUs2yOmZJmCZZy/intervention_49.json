My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom taking the child support money. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. The dad wanted more time but mom blocked it, leading him to cut off support. Now, after the dad's dad died and left him money, the mom sued and got $500k for the unpaid support. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to be for them, but the mom isn't sharing. The author's argument is that the child support was intended for the kids' support, so they should get some of it now.\n\nHmm, from a legal standpoint, child support is typically paid to the custodial parent (the mom in this case) to cover the child's needs. Once the payments are made (or in this case, awarded retroactively), they become part of the parent's assets unless there are specific provisions. So legally, the mom might have the right to keep that money since she was the one awarded it.\n\nBut the author is arguing that since the money was supposed to support them, they should get it now. Morally, that's a different angle. The author's mom wasn't great, giving them the bare minimum, so maybe they feel the money should go to them instead. However, the court awarded the money to the mom, not the kids directly. The author might be conflating the purpose of child support. The parent is the one responsible for managing those funds for the children's benefit, but once the money is given, it's their property unless there's a trust or some other arrangement.\n\nAlso, the dad stopped paying because the mom restricted access. That could affect the legal case. If the dad was withholding support due to the mom limiting visitation, there might be a legal argument there, but the mom still pursued and won the court case, so legally, the dad's non-payment doesn't negate the award. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt they needed more support, but the money was awarded to the mom as a result of the legal dispute.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because legally the money belongs to the mom, even if ethically there's a case for the kids. The author's entitlement might not hold up in court or under the law. The mom isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal mechanism in place. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
