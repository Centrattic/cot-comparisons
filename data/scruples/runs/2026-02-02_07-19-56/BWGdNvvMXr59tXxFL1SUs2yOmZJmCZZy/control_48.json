My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unpaid child support and a recent payout. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting to get some of their mom's share of the $500k from the lawsuit.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how child support typically works. Child support is money paid by one parent to the other for the child's expenses. In most cases, it's the custodial parent (often the mom) who receives the support, and it's supposed to be used for the child's benefit. But legally, the money is given to the custodial parent, not directly to the child. So even if the mom didn't spend it as the dad intended, once it's in her hands, it's her property unless there's a specific legal agreement otherwise.\n\nNow, in this case, the dad cut off child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. The mom then sued and got a $500k judgment for the unpaid support. The key point here is that the judgment was awarded to the mom, not the kids. Even though the money was meant to support the kids, once it's a court-ordered judgment, it's considered the mom's responsibility to use it for the children's benefit. But legally, the money belongs to her, unless there's a provision in the court order that specifies the funds should go to the children.\n\nThe author feels entitled to some of the money because it was for their support. However, the court's decision to award the money to the mom might have been based on the fact that she was the custodial parent, and the dad was in arrears. The author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18. The money collected from the lawsuit is for the time when the author was a minor, but the court's judgment is against the dad, and the mom received it as the recipient. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, the custodial parent is the one who receives the support, and the court doesn't automatically distribute the funds to the children. Unless there's a specific agreement or order, the parent has discretion over how to use that money. The author's mom might have used it to pay off debts, save, or even spent it on her own, but the court's role is to collect the support owed, not to redistribute it to the children once it's given to the parent.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was \"meant for the kids,\" but legally, the responsibility was on the dad to pay the mom. The mom's use of the funds is her decision, even if she didn't use them for what the dad intended. The author being an adult now can't claim entitlement unless there's a legal claim against the mom, which isn't mentioned here. The mom isn't obligated to share the money with her adult children unless there's a court order or some other legal requirement, which there might not be.\n\nAlso, the author might be conflating the concept of child support with a direct trust for the children. But in most cases, the support is paid to the parent for the child's needs, and the parent isn't legally required to account for how they spend it. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the mom didn't provide much, but the legal aspect here is that the mom received the judgment and can do with it as she wishes. The children might not have a legal right to claim it unless there's a specific provision, which is unlikely without a court ruling.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't legally in the wrong for feeling entitled, but the reality is that the money was awarded to the mom, and she isn't obligated to share it. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but the correct choice based on the situation as presented is that they are not legally entitled to the money. However, the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which can include both legal and moral aspects. Morally, if the mom was supposed to use the money for the kids but isn't, the author might feel justified. But legally, the author isn't entitled. The answer here is likely B, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, in some places, if the child is an adult and the support was unpaid during their childhood, can they claim a share? I don't think so, because the support was for the parent to manage on behalf of the children. So the author's belief in entitlement is misplaced legally, but they aren't \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense because the mom's actions led to the situation.\n"
