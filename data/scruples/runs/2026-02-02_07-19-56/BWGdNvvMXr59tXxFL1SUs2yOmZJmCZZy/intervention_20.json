My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's mom received $500k as unpaid child support from the dad. The dad had stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more, but now he's inherited money and the mom sued for back payments. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it's supposed to support the kids, but the mom isn't sharing it. The author is upset because the money was intended for them, especially as they had a minimal upbringing. The mom called the author selfish and ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically a legal obligation from the parent to the child, but in this case, the dad cut it off. The mom sued and got the money. Legally, the child support was owed to the mom as the custodial parent, not directly to the children. So the mom is the one who received the judgment, even though the money was for the kids' support. The author is now arguing that since the money was for them, they should get some. But legally, once the court awards it to the mom, it's her property unless there's a specific legal mechanism for the children to claim a share.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author feels entitled because they didn't have much growing up. However, the mom might see the money as compensation for her own role in the lack of support during the kids' childhood. The mom might not have used the previous child support effectively, and the back payments are now in her hands. The author is now an adult, and the money was awarded after they were 18. The purpose of child support is to support the child during minority, so once they're adults, the money isn't theirs unless there's a legal provision for that.\n\nAlso, the dad's actions: he cut off support because the mom was blocking visitation. The mom's lawsuit might be seen as using the courts to get money from the dad, possibly for her own benefit now that the children are grown. The children's claim now is more about perceived fairness rather than legal entitlement.\n\nSo, the author's argument is based on the idea that the money was meant for them, but legally and practically, once the court awarded it to the mom, it's her property. The author is an adult now, so unless there's a legal right for grown children to claim part of their parent's property, the author isn't entitled. Morally, it's complicated. The mom might be seen as using the system to get money that was meant for past support, but now she's keeping it, which could be seen as unfair. However, the author's entitlement isn't legally supported here. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the money is the mom's once awarded, and the children can't claim it unless there's a specific arrangement. So the answer is A.\n"
