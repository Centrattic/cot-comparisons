My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about child support and money from a grandparent's inheritance.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then the dad's dad died and left him money. The mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the author thinks they should get some of that money because it was meant for them, but the mom isn't sharing. The author feels entitled, but the mom says they're selfish. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. Child support is supposed to support the child, right? If the dad stopped paying because the mom was blocking visitation, but the mom later got the unpaid support from the inheritance. Now the money is in the mom's hands. The author wants a share because it was for their benefit. \n\nBut legally, once child support is paid, it's usually considered the custodial parent's money to use for the child's needs. The parent can decide how to spend it, as long as it's for the child. So if the mom received the back child support, she's supposed to use it for the kids, but she isn't. The author could argue that the money is still for their benefit, but the mom isn't using it for that. \n\nHowever, the author isn't a legal guardian and the mom might have control over the money. The author is an adult now, so maybe they can't claim entitlement. The mom might have the right to keep it, even if it was for the kids. But the author is upset because the money was supposed to be for their support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's dad cut off support, so maybe the mom should have pursued legal action earlier. But she didn't until the inheritance came through. The mom's action might have been opportunistic. The author is now in their 20s or older, so the money was recovered when the child is no longer a minor. \n\nLegally, once the child is an adult, any unpaid child support might no longer be their right to claim. The mom might have the right to the money as part of a court award for the unpaid support, even if it's after the child has grown up. But ethically, some might argue the money should go to the child since it's for their support. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who received the award; the mom did. The author can't claim it directly unless there's a legal way to do so. The author might be in a moral stance, but legally, the mom might have the right to keep it. The author is asking if they are in the wrong for thinking they should get some. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on legal vs. moral perspectives. If the author is not the legal recipient, they might not be in the wrong for feeling entitled, but legally the mom has the right. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which is a subjective call. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, people often consider both legal and moral aspects. The author isn't doing anything wrong for wanting the money, but they might not have a legal claim. The mom's action could be seen as selfish, but the author might not be in the wrong for feeling that. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
