My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for thinking they're entitled to their mom's unpaid child support. The situation involves the mom suing the dad and getting a large payout instead of sharing it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's benefit. Once the support is paid, it's generally the custodial parent's responsibility to use it for the child's needs. But in this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom didn't let him see the kids. Then, when the dad's father left him money, the mom sued for unpaid support and got a big settlement. Now, the author feels they should get some of that money since it was for them, but the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nLegally, the settlement might be considered compensation for the child support that was owed, but once the court awards it to the mom, the money becomes hers unless there's a court order directing otherwise. The court might have considered the purpose, but the actual ownership after the award is to the mom. So from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a claim to that money. The mom is the one who received the award, so she's the owner now.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels entitled because the support was supposed to be for them. But legally, the mom's right to the money after a court award is solid. The author's argument that it's for the kids isn't legally valid once the court has made the decision. The author might be right in feeling wronged, but not in terms of legal entitlement.\n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as self-serving, but unless there's a legal mechanism to challenge the award, the author doesn't have a case. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author isn't legally at fault for feeling entitled, but legally, the mom owns the money. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled. Since the author isn't legally wrong, but might be misunderstanding the legal ownership, the answer might be B. But wait, the actual answer depends on whether the author's belief is justified. Since the money was awarded to the mom, the author isn't entitled to it. So the author's belief might be in the wrong, making the answer A. Hmm, conflicting possibilities.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. If the author is not legally entitled, then thinking they are would be in the wrong. But if the author's reasoning is based on the original intent of child support, which is for the children's benefit, maybe there's a moral argument. However, once it's awarded to the mom, it's her money. So legally, the author isn't entitled, so thinking they are might be a wrong belief. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having that belief. If the author is not legally wrong, then answer B. But the answer depends on the jurisdiction. In many places, child support is the custodial parent's to manage for the child's benefit. Once the court awards the back support to the mom, it's her property. Therefore, the author's belief that they are entitled to some of it is incorrect. So the author is in the wrong (A). But the answer is tricky because the perception of entitlement vs legal reality. The answer might be B because the author isn't in the wrong for thinking they are entitled, but the legal system might not agree. The question is about moral blame, not legal correctness. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is a moral/judgment question. The answer might be B (No) because the author's reasoning isn't necessarily wrong morally, even if legally they aren't entitled. But the user is asking if the author is at fault for thinking they are entitled. The mom's refusal to share could be seen as greedy, but the author's entitlement is based on the original intent. However, once it's awarded, the money is the mom's. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they aren't entitled to the money post-award. But maybe the answer is B because the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. This is confusing. Need to check similar cases. In many jurisdictions, once the support is awarded to the custodial parent, it's their money. So the author's belief is incorrect. So the answer would be A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if their belief is correct. If the author is wrong in their belief, then they are in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. Therefore, answer A. But wait, the original support was supposed to go to the kids, but once the court gives it to the mom, it's hers. So the author's belief is wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
