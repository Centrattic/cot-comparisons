My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their mom collecting unpaid child support from their dad and now the author wants some of that money. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how child support works. Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to help with the child's expenses. In this case, the dad was supposed to pay child support but stopped because the mom wouldn't let the dad see the kids more. Then the mom sued and got $500k in unpaid support. Now the mom isn't sharing it with her kids, and the author feels entitled to some of it.\n\nThe key points here are: who legally owns the child support money? Since child support is intended for the child's benefit, but it's paid to the custodial parent (the mom here), does that mean the money belongs to the mom or the kids? I think legally, the custodial parent manages the funds for the child's needs, but once the child is an adult, any remaining funds might be the parent's. However, there could be state laws that vary.\n\nThe author argues that since the money was meant for them as children, they should get some. The mom, on the other hand, received it as part of a court award, and she's the one who went through the legal process. If the kids are adults now, the mom might have the right to keep the money, especially if there's no legal obligation to share it. \n\nAlso, the author's dad gave up the inheritance to pay child support. The court awarded the money to the mom because that's how child support cases are handled. The author's expectation to receive a portion could be seen as a personal belief, but unless there's a legal mechanism to reclaim that money (like a court order requiring the mom to share), the author might not have a legal standing. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels they were deprived as kids, but that's a separate issue from legal entitlement. The mom's actions might be within her rights, even if morally questionable. The author might be in the right in feeling wronged, but legally, unless there's a way to challenge the mom's possession of the funds, they might not have a case. \n\nSo, based on legal principles, the author might not be in the wrong morally, but if there's no legal claim, then they might be in the wrong to expect it. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering both legal and ethical aspects. If the author is not legally entitled, then from a legal standpoint, they might be in the wrong. But ethically, there's a case for sharing. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B, the answer depends on the legal perspective. Since the money was awarded to the mom, the author can't claim it legally, so maybe they are in the wrong to think they're entitled. But I need to make sure about the legal aspect here.\n"
