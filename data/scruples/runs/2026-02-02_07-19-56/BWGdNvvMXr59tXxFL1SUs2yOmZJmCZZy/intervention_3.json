My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mom getting a large sum of money from her ex-husband's unpaid child support, and the author wants to claim some of it because it was originally for them as kids. The author argues that the purpose of child support is to support the children, but the mom isn't sharing it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. Once the child reaches adulthood, the child support obligation usually ends. In this case, the mom received the unpaid child support after the children were already adults. Legally, that money is owned by the mother because she was the custodial parent and the court awarded it to her. The author, as an adult, might not have a legal claim to that money anymore.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical angle. The author feels entitled because the money was originally intended for them. But the mother used that money to support them during their childhood, even if it was minimal. The mother might argue that she used the funds to provide for their basic needs as required by the child support. Now that they're adults, the money is hers to manage. The author's argument is that the mom didn't provide much beyond the basics, so the money should be shared. But the mother's perspective is that she fulfilled her role by providing the minimum required.\n\nAnother point is the dad's situation. He stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. The court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, which was a legal decision based on the dad's failure to pay. The fact that the mom received a large inheritance from the dad's father and then sued him complicates things, but the court's ruling was about past unpaid support.\n\nThe author is now an adult and is claiming entitlement to the money. Legally, unless there's a specific court order stating that the children have a claim to future support once they become adults, the mother has the right to the lump sum. Ethically, it's a matter of perspective. The mother might not see the need to share because the money was intended to cover past obligations, while the children feel it's unfair since they didn't benefit from it as they were supposed to.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because the mother legally owns the money, and there's no entitlement for adult children unless there's a specific agreement or court order. The mother's responsibility was to use the child support during the children's minority, and any leftover or awarded amount is hers to manage.\n"
