My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom taking the child support money from their dad and not sharing it with them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, when the dad's dad died and left him money, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the mom isn't giving any of that money to the kids, and the author feels entitled to some of it.\n\nSo, the legal aspect: Child support is supposed to support the children. If the dad stopped paying because the mom restricted visitation, maybe there's a legal reason for that. But once the court ordered the mom to get the unpaid support, that money technically belongs to her? Or is it still the kids' money? Hmm. I'm not sure about the legal ownership here. In some cases, child support is paid to the parent who has custody, but the money is for the child's benefit. If the parent keeps it and doesn't use it for the kids, does the child have a claim?\n\nEthically, the author might feel they deserve the money because it was meant for their support. But the mom used a court to get it, so maybe legally it's hers. However, if the money was meant to support the kids, and the mom isn't sharing it, there's a moral argument for the kids to have a claim.\n\nAlso, the dad cutting off support because of the mom's restrictions\u2014maybe that's a factor. If the dad's actions led to the unpaid support, does that affect the kids' entitlement? It's complicated. Maybe the court's decision was based on the dad's obligation regardless of the visitation issues.\n\nI think the answer might depend on legal specifics, but since the mom obtained the money through court, legally she might have a right to it. However, morally, the kids might feel they deserve it. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but legally, they might not have a claim. So the answer could be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for feeling entitled, even if they can't legally claim it. But I need to be careful here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not if they can get the money. The author's belief might be valid ethically but not legally, but they're not in the wrong for having that belief.\n"
