My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) regarding their mom taking their dad's inheritance to cover unpaid child support and not sharing it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is a legal obligation where the non-custodial parent pays for the child's needs. In this case, the dad was ordered to pay, but the mom didn't let him see the kids, so he cut off payments. Now, years later, the mom sued for the unpaid support, and got money from the dad's inheritance. \n\nLegally, when a parent sues for back child support, that money is typically considered to be for the benefit of the children. However, once the support is paid, it becomes the mother's property if she's the custodial parent, because she's the one managing the funds. The question here is whether the kids have a claim to that money now.\n\nThe author argues that since the child support was meant to support them, they should get some of it. But once the support is paid by the father, it's generally considered to be under the mother's control as the custodial parent. The purpose of child support is to help cover the children's living expenses, which the mom is responsible for. So if the mom used the money to cover their basic needs, even if they were minimal, she might be within her rights to keep it. \n\nHowever, there's an ethical angle. The mom provided only the bare minimum, which the author feels was not enough, but legally, once the support is paid, the custodial parent has discretion over how it's used. The author might feel entitled because the money was supposed to support them, but legally, once it's in the mom's hands, she can decide what's best for their upbringing. \n\nThe dad cutting off support because of the mom not allowing visitation might complicate things, but the court's decision to award the back support to the mom could be based on the legal obligation regardless of the reasons behind the non-payment. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author is not entitled to the money because once the support is paid, it's under the custodial parent's control. Ethically, it's a different matter, but the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about legal and moral responsibility. The mom's decision not to share might be legally sound, so the author's claim could be seen as not being in the wrong if we consider the intent, but legally, the author might not have a valid claim. However, the answer hinges on whether the money is considered the children's or the mom's. If it's the latter, then the author is in the wrong for expecting a share. If the money was supposed to be for the children's benefit, but the mom kept it, then she might be in the wrong. The line here is tricky. But generally, courts don't require distribution of back support payments to the children after the support is paid to the custodial parent. So the answer is likely B: No, the author is not in the wrong, but wait, that might not be right. Wait, maybe the author is in the wrong because once the support is paid, it's the mom's to manage. So if the author is arguing for a share of money that's already been paid and considered fulfilled, then the author is in the wrong. So answer A: Yes. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The key point is that child support is a payment from the father to the custodial parent for the children's needs. Once paid, it's the custodial parent's responsibility to use it for the child's benefit, but they are not obligated to share it with the children once the children are adults. So the mother keeping the money after it's paid is within her rights. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for expecting a share of money that was already paid to the mother. So the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not entitled to the money, then they are in the wrong for thinking they are. So answer A.\n"
