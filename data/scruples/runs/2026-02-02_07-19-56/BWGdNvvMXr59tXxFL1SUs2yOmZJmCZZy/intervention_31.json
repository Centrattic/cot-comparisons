My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The situation is about a mom who got $500k in unpaid child support from the dad, and now the author wants some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects here. Child support is supposed to support the child, right? But once the money is paid to the parent, especially after the child is an adult, does the child have any claim over it? I think once child support is paid to the parent, it becomes their property. The parent is trusted to use it for the child's needs, but once it's in their hands, it's theirs. So the author might be thinking, \"Why didn't my mom give me this money?\" but legally, once it's paid, it's the parent's money. The mom isn't required to share it with the kids unless there's a court order or something else. \n\nAlso, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. The court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, which might be because she was the custodial parent. So the mom is the one who received the judgment for the unpaid support. The author is now an adult, so maybe they can't claim entitlement to that money now. \n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The author feels the money was intended for them, but legally, it was paid to the mother. The mom used her own judgment to use it as she saw fit, which might be her prerogative. The author's argument is that the money was for the kids, but once it's paid to the parent, it's their responsibility to manage it for the child's benefit. If the parent didn't use it appropriately, maybe there's a different issue, but once the money is in their hands, it's theirs. \n\nThe author's mom did provide basic needs, even if not luxurious. The author might feel deprived, but that's a different matter. The entitlement to the money might not be valid because it's already been distributed to the parent. So the author is in the wrong because they're claiming entitlement to money that legally belongs to the mother now. \n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions where adult children can claim child support. Usually, child support ends when the child turns 18 or graduates from high school. If the author was already an adult when the support was paid, then they can't claim it now. The $500k is from unpaid support, which the court decided to award to the mom, so it's her money to handle. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because they are not entitled to that money once it's been awarded to the parent.\n"
