My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mom receiving a large sum of money from their dad through a court-awarded unpaid child support claim. The author wants some of that money, arguing it was intended for them as part of the child support, but the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more, which is a common reason for a father to cut off payments if he's not allowed visitation. Then, after the dad's father passed, he got an inheritance. The mom sued for the unpaid child support and won $500k. Now, the author wants that money, thinking it was meant for the kids' support. The mom is keeping it all, and the author feels entitled to some of it.\n\nLegally, child support is typically paid to the custodial parent (in this case, the mom) to support the children. So the $500k is a judgment against the dad for unpaid child support, which the court awarded to the mom. That means the money is technically the mom's now, as she's the one who received it through legal means. However, the author is arguing that since the purpose was to support the kids, they should get some of it.\n\nEthically, this is a gray area. The mom provided the bare minimum, so the author might feel she didn't use the child support properly. But the legal award is to the mom, so she has the right to do with it as she wishes unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. The author might not have a legal claim to the money, but morally, some might argue that the money was for the children's benefit and should be shared.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the child support was for them, then they should get some. But once the money is awarded to the mom, it's her property. Unless there's a legal mechanism to distribute it to the children (like a court order), the author can't claim it. The mom's refusal to share it could be seen as her exercising her right to keep the money, even if the original intent was for the kids' support.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author is not in the wrong, but their argument about entitlement might not hold up because the money is now the mom's. However, the ethical side is more about whether the mom is misusing the funds. The author's position is based on the intended use of the money, but legally, once it's awarded, it's the recipient's to handle. Therefore, the author's belief that they're entitled to some of it might not be legally valid, but they're not necessarily the asshole for thinking that. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
