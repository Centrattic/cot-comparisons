My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unpaid child support and a recent payout. The author's mom received $500k from the dad for unpaid child support, and now the author is upset that the mom isn't sharing it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is supposed to go to the child, right? But in this case, since the kids are now adults (the author mentions they are closer to the dad now, and the mom sued after the dad's dad died, implying the kids are grown), the child support was paid to the mom through the lawsuit. Legally, once the child is an adult, the support is likely considered the parent's property, especially if the lawsuit was settled under the parent's name. So the mom might have a legal right to that money.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author thinks the money was originally for them, but the purpose of child support is to support the child while they're minors. The author's mom provided the basics but not much more. The author feels entitled because the money was meant for their upbringing. But the mom, as the custodial parent, was the one receiving the child support, and once the child is an adult, the parent might not be obligated to share it. The mom might argue that the money was used to cover past expenses, which is why she's not sharing it now.\n\nThe author is upset because the mom is keeping the money, but the mom might see it as her own to handle, given the legal settlement. The author's argument is that the purpose of child support was for the kids, so they should get some now. However, legally, once the child is grown, that support is no longer active, and any past-due payments would be the parent's responsibility, though some states might have different rules about retroactive support. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting a share. Legally, the author might not have a claim, but morally, it's a gray area. The mom did receive the money through a legal judgment, so unless there's a provision that the money is to be shared with the children, the author might be in the wrong. The author's entitlement is based on the idea that the money was for them, but the legal system awarded it to the mom, which could mean it's her to do with as she wishes. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
