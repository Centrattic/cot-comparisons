My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their mom getting $500k from their dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants some of that money now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is money the non-custodial parent pays to the custodial parent to help support the child. In this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then later, she sued him and got the money. Legally, that money is supposed to go to the child's support while they were minors. But now the kids are grown, so does the mom get to keep it? Or do the kids have a claim?\n\nI remember that in some cases, if a parent is awarded past child support, it's considered part of the custodial parent's assets unless the court specifies otherwise. But the author argues that since the money was intended for their upbringing, they should get it now. However, the mom received it legally through the court, so maybe she has ownership over it now. Unless there's a specific law that says the children can claim it after the fact, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author feels entitled because the money was supposed to be for their support. But the mom used the court to get that money, perhaps as a settlement for the unpaid support. If the court awarded it to her, that might mean she's the rightful recipient. The author's argument is that the money was for them, but legally, once it's awarded, it's the recipient's property. The author might be right emotionally, but legally, maybe the mom has rights over it now.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that the purpose of child support is to support the kids is correct, but once the money is given to the mother, it's her responsibility to use it for that purpose. If she didn't, maybe that's a different issue. However, the author can't claim ownership unless there's a specific legal claim against their mom's use of the funds.\n\nSo, considering the legal perspective, the author might not have a valid claim because the mom received the money through the court. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author feels wronged because the money was for them, but without legal standing, it's hard to say they're in the right. The mom's actions might be seen as keeping what's legally hers, even if it feels unfair to the author. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for expecting to get money that was legally awarded to their mother.\n"
