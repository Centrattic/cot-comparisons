My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because their mom got $500k from their dad for unpaid child support, and now she's keeping it all. The author feels entitled to some of it because the money was supposed to support the kids. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now the dad got money from his dad's inheritance, and the mom sued to get the back child support.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the legal aspect here. Child support is typically money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom was restricting his visitation, maybe that's a different matter. But the court awarded the mom the money for unpaid child support, which likely means the court found the dad in default. So legally, the mom received the funds as compensation for the support that was supposed to go to the children.\n\nBut the author is now an adult and wants their share. However, the child support was paid retroactively to the mom, not directly to the children. Once the money is awarded to the mom, it's her property, unless there's a legal mechanism to claim a portion. Legally, the children's rights to child support end when they become adults, unless there's a specific agreement. The mom might have used the funds for the children's benefit while they were minors, but once they're adults, she's not obligated to share it unless there's a court order.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels it's unfair because they had a deprived childhood and the money was meant for them. But legally, once the child support is paid to the custodial parent, it's their responsibility to use it for the children's benefit, but they aren't required to share it with adult children unless specified otherwise. The author's claim might not have legal standing. The author might be in the right morally, but legally, they might not have a case. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they can't claim entitlement to funds that were already awarded to the mother, especially after they're adults. However, maybe there's a different angle, like if the mom misused the funds. But the post doesn't mention that. The mom provided the basics but not luxuries. The author's argument is that the money was for the kids, but once the funds are in the mom's possession, she's the one responsible. So the author's in the wrong because they can't claim it now as an adult. So answer A.\n"
