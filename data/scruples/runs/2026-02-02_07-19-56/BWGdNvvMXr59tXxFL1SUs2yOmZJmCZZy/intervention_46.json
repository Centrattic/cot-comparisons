My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the mother suing the father for unpaid child support and then not sharing the money with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is a payment made by one parent to the other for the child's benefit. If the mother received the money as part of a court award for unpaid child support, legally, it's hers to manage since she was the custodial parent. The children aren't the ones who received the money, so they can't claim it directly. \n\nBut the author feels entitled because the money was supposed to support them. However, once the child support is paid to the mother, it's her responsibility to use it for the child's needs. The mother isn't legally obligated to share it with the adult children unless there's a court order. The father cutting off support might have been due to the mother's actions, which complicates things, but the legal system awarded the money to her.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for them, but in legal terms, once the support is paid to the custodial parent, it's their property. The children can't claim it after they're adults. So the author is in the wrong because they're expecting to receive money that was awarded to their mother, not them. The mother's decision to keep it is within her rights, even if it's morally questionable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
