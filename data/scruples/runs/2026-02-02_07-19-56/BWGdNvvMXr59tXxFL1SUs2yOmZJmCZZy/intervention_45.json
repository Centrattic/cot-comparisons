My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong regarding their mother taking the child support money that was awarded to her. The author argues that the money was meant for them and their siblings, as it's unpaid child support, and that their mom shouldn't keep it all. The mom, on the other hand, received the money through a lawsuit and isn't sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's support. Here, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then, the dad inherited money, and the mom sued him for back child support. The court awarded her $500k. Legally, once the child support is paid to the custodial parent, it's their money to manage as they see fit unless there's a court order stating otherwise. So the mom might have legal rights to that money now.\n\nBut the author is arguing that the money was intended for them, so they should get some. However, once the money was awarded to the mom, it's her property. Even if the original intent was for the children, once it's in the mom's hands, she's not obligated to share unless there's a legal requirement. The author's argument is more about moral entitlement rather than legal entitlement.\n\nThe mom is described as not providing much beyond basics. But legally, she isn't required to share the child support money received after the children are adults. The author is now an adult, so the child support obligation would have ended when they became 18. The money awarded was for past support, which the mom received. There's no legal way the author can claim that money unless they were minors at the time of the award, which they weren't.\n\nSo the author's position is based on a misunderstanding of legal rights. They might feel they deserve it because the support was for them, but once the money is awarded to the mom, it's hers to keep. The mom isn't in the wrong for not sharing, and the author is in the wrong for thinking they have a claim to it. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
