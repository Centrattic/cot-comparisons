My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom taking child support money that was unpaid from the dad, and now the author feels entitled to some of it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. Child support is typically a legal obligation where the non-custodial parent pays the custodial parent to help cover the child's expenses. In this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, paying every other weekend. The mom stopped allowing more visits, so the dad cut off support. Now, with the dad's father passing and leaving money, the mom sued for the unpaid support and got $500k. She's keeping it all, and the author feels it should be shared since it was for them.\n\nI should check the legal standpoint. If the dad was supposed to pay child support but didn't, and the mom received it as a judgment, that money is likely considered hers to use for the child's benefit. However, the author is an adult now, so maybe the support was meant to be used during their childhood. But once the child is an adult, the custodial parent might have discretion over how to use any past support. Legally, the money is a reimbursement to the custodial parent for expenses incurred during the child's upbringing. So the author might not have a legal claim to it now, unless there's a specific law in their jurisdiction that allows this. But the question is more about ethics.\n\nEthically, the author's argument is that the money was intended for them, but the mom used it as compensation for past support. The author is now an adult, so maybe the mom isn't obligated to share it. But the author is upset because their childhood wasn't great\u2014basic needs met but not more. The mom might be seen as using the money to compensate herself for the support she was supposed to get, but not necessarily for the kids. However, the author is now in their 20s or 30s, so the support was supposed to be used when they were minors. The mom's decision to keep the money might be her right, but the author feels wronged because the money was meant for them. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer would depend on legal specifics, but ethically, the author's entitlement might not hold if they're no longer minors. Also, the mom's actions in cutting the dad off and not allowing visits are part of the backstory. The author's perspective is that the dad's support was for them, but the mom is using it now, which might not be fair. However, once the support is legally awarded, it's the custodial parent's money to handle. So the author might not be in the wrong ethically if the money was for their benefit, but legally, it's the mom's to use as she sees fit. The answer probably leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because the mom is using the money for her own reasons, but the author's claim is based on the intended purpose. But I need to be careful here. Maybe the child support was paid to the mom for her expenses, so the kids don't have a claim. So the answer might be B, but there's nuance. I should confirm the general legal principle here. Usually, child support is distributed by the custodial parent without the child's input once they're adults. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, but the mom is under no obligation to share it. So the answer is B.\n"
