My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for wanting some or all of their mom's unpaid child support. The background is that the author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more, so he cut off the payments. Now, the dad's father left him a lot of money, but the mom sued and got $500k for the unpaid child support. The author feels that since the child support was meant for the kids, they should get some of it. The mom, however, is keeping it all and not sharing, even though she provided a bare-minimum upbringing.\n\nFirst, I should recall what child support is intended for. Typically, child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. So in this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, and the mom was getting the support. But he stopped paying because the mom wouldn't allow him more time with the kids. The mom then got a court to award her $500k for the unpaid support. However, the author is arguing that the money should go to the kids because it was intended for their support.\n\nBut here's the catch: once child support is ordered and the payments are made, they become part of the custodial parent's assets, right? Unless there's a specific court ruling or agreement that the money goes directly to the child. The author was an adult when the lawsuit happened, so the retroactive child support might be considered a debt owed to the mom, not the kids. The author is now an adult and might not have a legal claim to that money unless the court originally directed it to be given to the children. \n\nThe mom's argument is that she's the one who was awarded the money, so she can decide what to do with it. The author is upset because they feel the money was supposed to support them as kids, but since it's already been given to the mom, it's her property now. Unless there's a legal mechanism to claim a portion of that money as an adult, the author might not have a valid claim. \n\nAlso, the dad cutting off support because the mom wouldn't allow more visitation\u2014while the dad might have a right to seek more visitation, cutting off support could have been a mistake. But the court's decision to award the mom the unpaid support suggests that legally, she has the right to that money now. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling entitled, but they don't have a legal claim. Emotionally, it's understandable, but the author is an adult now, and the money isn't theirs. The mom's actions in keeping it might be greedy, but the author's desire to get some of it might not be legally justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong, because they're justified in feeling entitled, but legally, the mom has the right to the money. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't legally in the wrong, but the situation is more about their feelings versus the legal reality. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) part is about social wrongs, not legal ones. The author isn't acting in the wrong here\u2014they're expressing their feelings and their belief that they deserve some of the money. The mom's actions are questionable, but the author isn't at fault for thinking that.\n"
