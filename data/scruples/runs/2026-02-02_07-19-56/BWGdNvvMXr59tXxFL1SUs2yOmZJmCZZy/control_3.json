My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about unpaid child support and a recent lawsuit where the mom got money from the dad. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to support them when they were kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid to the parent who has primary custody, right? So when the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, maybe there was a legal reason why the support stopped. If the dad was legally supposed to pay, but the mom restricted visitation, that might affect the court's decision. But then the mom later sued for the unpaid child support and won a large sum. Now the author is arguing that the money should be shared because it was meant for the children.\n\nBut legally, once the child support is paid (or in this case, the unpaid amount is collected), it's considered the custodial parent's money because they were the ones responsible for the children's care. The courts usually don't require the custodial parent to share that money with the kids once it's been awarded. The purpose of child support is to support the child, but the parent is the one who manages it for that purpose. So maybe the mom isn't obligated to give the money to her children now.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel wronged because the money was supposed to be for their benefit, but legally, it's a bit different. The mom might have the right to keep it as it was part of her settlement. Also, the fact that she provided the bare minimum doesn't necessarily mean she's obligated to share the money now. The author's argument is more about the intent of the money rather than the legal ownership.\n\nHowever, there's an emotional aspect here. The author is upset because their needs weren't met during childhood and feels the money should now be used for their benefit. But legally, once the child is an adult, the custodial parent isn't required to distribute that money. So the author might not be in the wrong morally or emotionally, but legally, the mom might have the upper hand. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is a matter of perspective. Legally, maybe not, but ethically, it's a gray area. But the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to pick between A and B. The answer is probably B (No), because the author is not in the wrong, but the mom isn't obligated to share the money either. The author's entitlement is based on the intention of the money, not legal rights. So the answer is B.\n"
