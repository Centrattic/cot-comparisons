My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of the unpaid child support money their mom received from their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't allow more visitation. Then, after the dad's dad died, the mom sued and got a $500k payout for unpaid child support. Now, the author feels this money should be shared with them and their siblings since it was supposed to support them. The mom refuses, calling them selfish.\n\nChild support is legally meant to support the child, even if it's paid to the custodial parent. So, if the mom received that money, it's still intended for the kids' benefit. The author is arguing that since the money was meant for them, they should get a share now. The mom is keeping it all, which the kids see as unfair.\n\nLegally, in many places, once child support is paid to the parent, it becomes their property. But the initial intent was for the child's support. The author's case might be more about moral or ethical rights rather than legal. However, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be ways to argue that the children have a claim if the parent is using the money in a way that doesn't serve the child's best interest.\n\nThe mom's actions of withholding the money could be seen as against the original purpose. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, especially if they believe the money was misused. The answer here would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the money was intended for the children's support, and the mom is keeping it despite their needs. However, legal specifics can vary, but ethically, the author's stance is justified.\n"
