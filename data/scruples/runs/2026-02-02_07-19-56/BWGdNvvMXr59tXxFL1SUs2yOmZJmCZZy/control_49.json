My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting some of the child support money that their mom received from their dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more, but now the dad and kids are closer. The dad's dad died and left him a lot of money. The mom sued the dad for the unpaid child support and got $500k, which the dad now has to give her. The author thinks this money should go to the kids since it was for their support, but the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nSo, the main question is about entitlement. Child support is meant to support the children, right? But once it's paid, it becomes the mother's responsibility to use it for the kids. However, in this case, the money wasn't actually paid; it was a lump sum from unpaid support. The court awarded it to the mom, so legally, does that mean it's hers to do with as she likes, even though it was for the kids?\n\nThe author feels entitled because the money was supposed to support them. But legally, the child support was owed to the mother as the custodial parent. Once the court awards it, it's her property. The author is now an adult, so there's no longer a legal requirement for the money to be given to the kids. \n\nHowever, morally, some might argue that since the money was for the children's support, it's unfair for the mom to keep it all. But others might say that the mom had the legal right to sue for the back payments and that it's her decision to make now. \n\nThe author's dad stopped paying because of the mom's interference, which complicates things. But the court's decision was based on the unpaid support. The mom's actions in suing and keeping the money could be seen as using the legal system to her advantage. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the money was intended for them, so they should get some. But in legal terms, once the support is recovered through a court, it's considered the mother's to manage, especially if the children are adults now. The author may feel wronged, but legally, the mom has the rights here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of their feelings or moral stance, but legally, they don't have a claim. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the mother's decision to keep the money is within her legal rights, even if it feels unfair.\n"
