My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a share of their mom's unpaid child support. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died and left money, the mom sued the dad for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the author wants some of that money because it was supposed to be for them, but the mom isn't sharing. The author feels entitled because the child support was meant to support the kids.\n\nI need to break this down. Legally, child support is paid to the custodial parent (in this case, the mom) to cover the child's needs. Even if the money wasn't used well, once it's given to the parent, it's their responsibility to allocate it. So the author might not have a legal claim to the money now that they're adults. But maybe there's a moral or ethical angle here.\n\nThe mom got the money through a court order, so she's legally entitled to it. The author argues that the purpose of child support is for the kids, but once the support was unpaid, the court awarded it to the mom. The author is now an adult, so the obligation for child support would have ended when they turned 18. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling entitled? They might not be legally wrong, but morally, it's complicated. The mom used the money for herself, not the kids, but the law might not allow the kids to claim it now. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might not have a legal right to it. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they're justified in feeling that the money was intended for them, but legally, they can't claim it. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal rights. Since the author is expressing a feeling of entitlement, which is a personal belief, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. The mom's actions might be the issue, not the author's feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
