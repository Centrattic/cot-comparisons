My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom getting child support from the dad, which she now has a lot of because of the dad's inheritance. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it was for their support. The mom isn't sharing it with them, and the author is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, child support is paid to the custodial parent to cover the child's needs. Once the child is over 18, the support typically stops unless there's a special agreement. The dad stopped paying because he wasn't allowed to see the kids enough, but now he's being sued for back support. The court awarded the mom $500k, which she's keeping.\n\nThe author is arguing that the money was meant for them, so they should get some. But legally, the court awarded it to the mom as part of the child support judgment. That means the mom now owns that money, and unless there's a court order or agreement for the kids to get a share, the mom isn't obligated to distribute it. \n\nEthically, some might say the money was intended for their upbringing, so they should get some. But the mom was the one in charge of managing that money during their childhood, and she didn't use it for luxuries. Now, she has the right to keep it unless the court ruled otherwise. The author's argument is more about the intent of the money, but legally, once it's awarded to the parent, it's their property. \n\nAlso, the dad's decision to stop child support might have been a bad move, but the court still went ahead with the back payments. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might not have legal standing to claim a share. The mom's refusal to share could be seen as her right since she's the recipient of the court-awarded funds. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is not legally entitled to the money, and since the court hasn't ordered any distribution to the children, they're in the wrong in demanding a share. The answer is A.\n"
