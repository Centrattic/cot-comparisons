My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting some of their mom's child support award. The situation is a bit complicated. \n\nSo, the kid had a mom and a dad. The dad didn't pay child support because the mom wouldn't let him see them more, so he cut it off. Now the dad's dad left him money, and the mom sued for the unpaid support, got $500k, and isn't sharing it with the kids. The kid feels entitled to some of it because that's what the child support was for originally.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. Child support is meant to support the child, right? If the dad didn't pay, and the mom collected it, does the kid have any claim to it? I remember that once child support is paid, it's the child's money. But in this case, the support wasn't paid at the time, so it was a retroactive award. The mom was awarded it, so legally, it might belong to her now. But the question is about morality, not just law. \n\nThe mom's reasoning is that she used the support for the kids, even if it was minimal. But the kids argue that the money was meant for their support. However, since the money was awarded to the mom, she might have discretion over it, especially if she was the one receiving it. The mom might not be obligated to share it with the kids unless there's a court order. \n\nBut the dad's inheritance from his father\u2014there's a twist there. The dad didn't get that money because the mom took the child support. So the kid is upset that the mom took money that was supposed to be child support, leaving the dad with nothing. The mom is keeping it all, and the kid wants a share. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say the kid is right because the child support was intended for them. Others might argue that once it's awarded to the mom, she can do with it as she sees fit, especially if she used it to cover basic needs. But the mom provided only the bare minimum, so maybe the kid feels they deserve more. \n\nLegally, I think the money is the mom's once she's awarded it. So the kid might not have a legal claim. Morally, there's a gray area. The mom might be seen as using the money to support them, even if it was minimal. But the kid might feel it was unfair that the dad's inheritance was taken to cover something that the mom didn't use adequately. \n\nThe answer depends on whether we consider legal entitlement or moral entitlement. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is more about moral judgment. The kid isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, but since the mom received the money, she's not obligated to share. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because their perspective is understandable given the situation, even if they can't legally claim the money.\n"
