My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking they deserve some of their mom's unpaid child support.\n\nFirst, the setup: The mom received $500k from the dad for unpaid child support, which was taken from the dad's inheritance. The mom isn't sharing it with her kids now. The author feels entitled to some of it because that's what child support is for.\n\nHmm. Legally, child support is money paid to the custodial parent (the mom here) to cover the child's needs. Once the support is paid, it becomes the parent's money, right? So the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then later, the mom sued and got the unpaid support. That was likely a court-ordered amount she could claim. Now that she has that money, does she have to share it with the kids? \n\nThe author argues the purpose of child support is for the kids, so they should get some. But legally, once the money is paid or awarded to the parent, it's their property. The mom could have used it for the kids, but she didn't spend it that way. Now she's keeping the payout. \n\nThe author is an adult now, so maybe there's no legal claim. But morally, is the author right to expect a share? The mom might see it as her own money now. The author's argument is that the money was meant for them. But since the support was retroactive, and the kids are adults, maybe there's no legal entitlement. However, the mom's actions in suing the dad might have been to benefit the kids, but she's not distributing it. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, probably not. Morally, maybe it's a gray area. The mom could be seen as keeping money that was supposed to support the kids, but once it's hers, she can do as she wishes. The author's entitlement might not be legally valid but is understandable emotionally. The answer would likely be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, even if there's no legal claim. The mom might be at fault for not sharing it.\n"
