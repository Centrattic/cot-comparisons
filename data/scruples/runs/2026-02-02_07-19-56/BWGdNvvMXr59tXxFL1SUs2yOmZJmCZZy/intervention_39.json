My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author's mom getting a large sum from the dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants some of that money. The author's dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see them more, and now the mom is keeping the money from the lawsuit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal side. Child support is money paid to the custodial parent (the mom in this case) to support the children. So legally, that money belongs to the mom to use for the kids' needs. Once the child turns 18, they don't get a direct share of past child support payments. So the author, being an adult now, might not have a legal claim to that money. \n\nBut there's the emotional and ethical angle. The author feels the money was intended for them and the siblings, so they should get some. However, the mom used it as a result of a legal action she took, so maybe she's the one who received it legally. The author's argument is that the money should support the kids, but once the case was settled, it's the mom's to manage unless there's a court order to distribute it differently. \n\nThe mom isn't a terrible parent but provided the basics. The author's dad gave up support because the mom didn't let him see the kids. Now the mom is keeping the money, which could be seen as her right since she was the one in the lawsuit. The author is upset because they believe the money was meant for them, but legally, it's the mom's. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they don't have a legal claim to the money. The mom was awarded the child support, and it's her responsibility to manage it for the kids' benefit while they were minors. Now that the kids are adults, the mom isn't obligated to share it with them unless there's a specific agreement. The author's entitlement might be based on a misunderstanding of how child support works. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
