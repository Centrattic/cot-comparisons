My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him spend time with them. Now the dad inherited money from his father, and the mom sued for unpaid child support and got $500k. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was for the kids, but the mom isn't sharing it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, child support is paid by the parent to the custodial parent, not directly to the child. So if the dad stopped support because the mom wasn't allowing visitation, maybe that was a mistake. But the mom later sued for back child support, which was awarded. However, the key point is that child support is intended to cover the child's needs. If the mom used the money she received (from the back support) for something other than the intended purpose, does the child have a right to it?\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, once the custodial parent receives child support, it becomes their property. Even if they didn't use it for the child's benefit, the law might not recognize the child's right to it. The author's argument is that the money was supposed to be for the kids, but legally, the mom was the one entitled to the back payments. So the author's entitlement isn't recognized by law. \n\nEthically, though, maybe the author has a point. The money was meant for their support, but the mom is keeping it now. However, the dad's decision to stop support by cutting off payments might have been a breach of the agreement, even if it was due to conflict with the mom. The mom's lawsuit was about collecting arrears, which she won. So she's within her legal rights to keep that money. \n\nThe author's claim is about entitlement, but if the law sees the custodial parent as the owner of the child support, then the author isn't in the right to demand it. The mom might be the legal custodian, even if the support was meant for the kids. Plus, the author is now an adult, so the original child support obligation ended when they turned 18. The back payments are for the time the author was a minor, but once the money was given to the mom, she could decide how to use it, even if it wasn't for their benefit. However, the money is supposed to be for the child's support, so if the mom misused it, maybe the kids have a case. But legally, the custodial parent controls the child support funds, even if they didn't use it properly. \n\nSo the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because legally, the mom is the one who received the back child support, and it's her property now. The author can't claim a right to it after the fact. Even if ethically it's questionable, the legal framework doesn't support their entitlement. The dad's decision to stop support was his mistake, but the author's demand on the mom's legally obtained money is where the wrong lies.\n"
