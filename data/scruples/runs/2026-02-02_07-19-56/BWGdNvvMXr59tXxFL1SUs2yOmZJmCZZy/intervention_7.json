My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they deserve some of their mom's unpaid child support. The situation involves the mom suing the dad and getting $500k, which was originally unpaid child support. The dad then got money from his father's inheritance but had to give it all to the mom for the child support. Now the author feels entitled to some of that money because it was meant for them as kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Child support is typically paid directly to the parent who has primary custody, which in this case is the mom. So legally, the mom receiving the money is correct. The author might think that the money should be shared with the kids since it was for their support, but legally, once the support is paid, it's up to the custodial parent to manage it. \n\nNext, the emotional and ethical side. The author feels the mom provided bare minimum and wasn't generous. They might see the money as rightfully theirs. However, the mom is within her rights to use the child support as she sees fit once it's in her possession. The dad cut off the support because the mom restricted visitation, which complicates things, but the court's decision on the unpaid support is final.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for the kids, but once it's in the mom's control, she's not obligated to share unless there's a legal requirement. The fact that the mom isn't sharing could be seen as her right, even if the author feels ungrateful. The author's entitlement might stem from a belief that the money belongs to them, but legally and ethically, the mom isn't in the wrong for keeping it. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the mom to share the money. The answer would be A.\n"
