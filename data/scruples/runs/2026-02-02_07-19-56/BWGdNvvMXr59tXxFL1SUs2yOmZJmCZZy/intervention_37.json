My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom's child support money. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died, the mom sued for the unpaid support and got $500k. Now the author thinks they should get some of that money since it was supposed to support them, but the mom is keeping it all. The author feels entitled, but the mom calls them selfish.\n\nHmm, legal aspects first. Child support is a legal obligation to support the child, so when the dad stopped paying, the mom could have pursued the support. But she didn't until later. When she did sue, she got the money. Legally, that money is typically for the benefit of the child, right? But once it's awarded to the parent, does it become their property? I think in most cases, child support is given to the parent for the child's needs, so once it's in the parent's possession, it's their responsibility to use it for the child. However, if the parent isn't using it properly, could the child have a claim?\n\nBut the author is an adult now. The child support was unpaid during their childhood. Now they're asking for a share of the back pay. Legally, the child support debt was owed to the state or to the parent, and once the parent received the money, it's theirs. However, ethically, maybe the parent should use it for the child's benefit. But since the kids are adults, the mom might have the right to use the money as she wishes.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for them. But the courts awarded it to the mom because she was the custodial parent. The dad was the one who stopped paying, so the mom's lawsuit was valid. The author's resentment stems from the mom not sharing, but if the money is legally hers, the author might not have a legal claim. Ethically, maybe the mom is at fault for not using the money for the kids' benefit, but the author's demand for a share now might not be justified, especially since they're adults.\n\nAlso, the mom provided the bare minimum, which is legally sufficient but not luxurious. The author's point about nice things and trips might be more about quality of life, but the mom met the basic needs. The author might be feeling deprived, but that's a separate issue from the child support money.\n\nSo, the author's entitlement might be based on the belief that the money was theirs. But legally, once the mom received the child support, it's hers. Unless there's a court order stating otherwise. The author's position could be seen as ungrateful because the mom provided the basics and now they're asking for a share of the money she received. The mom's actions in suing for the support were legally correct, and the author's demand might be ethically questionable since they're adults now. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
