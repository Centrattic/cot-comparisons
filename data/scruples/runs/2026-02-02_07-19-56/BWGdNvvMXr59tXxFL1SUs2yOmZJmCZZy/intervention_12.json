My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mom suing their dad for unpaid child support and then keeping the money instead of sharing it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of child support laws. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. The custodial parent is supposed to use that money for the children's needs. So in this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, paying the mom. But the mom didn't let him see the kids enough, so he stopped the support. Now, after his dad's inheritance, the mom sued him for back child support and got a large sum. The author believes they should get some of that money since it was meant for them.\n\nThe author's argument is that since the money was intended for their upbringing, they should get a share now. The mom, however, is keeping it all. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, legally, when child support is awarded, it's the custodial parent who receives the payments. The author is now an adult, so the child support would have stopped when they turned 18. The unpaid support from when they were minors was owed by the dad, but once the court awarded the money to the mom, it's her property. The author might not have a legal claim to that money now. However, morally, there's an argument that the money was to support the children, so some might feel the kids should benefit.\n\nBut legally, once the court awards the back child support to the custodial parent, it's hers to manage as she sees fit unless there's a legal claim by the children. The author's claim might not hold up in court because they're adults now. So, the author might be in the right morally, but in the wrong legally. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, which might depend on the perspective\u2014legal vs. moral. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not legally entitled to the money once their mom has received it. The child support was meant to support the kids when they were minors, but once it's awarded to the mom, it's her property. So, the author has no legal claim. Morally, some might argue the kids should get the money, but legally, the author is in the wrong for expecting it. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
