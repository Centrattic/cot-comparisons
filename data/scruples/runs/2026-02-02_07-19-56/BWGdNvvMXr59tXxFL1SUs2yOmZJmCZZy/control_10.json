My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unpaid child support and a recent payout. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author grew up with their mom and saw their dad every other weekend. The dad wanted more time but the mom wouldn't allow it, leading him to cut off child support. Now, the dad got money from his father's estate, and the mom sued for the unpaid child support, getting $500k. The author thinks the kids should get some of that money because the child support was originally for them. But the mom isn't sharing it, and the author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, that might not be a valid reason legally. However, if the mom was withholding visitation, that could be a separate issue. But the dad cutting off child support without a court order might have been his choice, even if it was unfair.\n\nNow, the mom sued and got the $500k. That seems like a retroactive child support claim. If the court ordered the dad to pay, then the money goes to the mom, right? Unless there's a way for the kids to claim it directly. But usually, child support goes through the custodial parent. However, if the mom wasn't using it properly (like providing minimal support), maybe there's a case for the kids to claim it now. But that's a legal question.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for them and they should get some now. But once the court awards the unpaid support to the mom, it's her money unless there's a way to claim it post-payment. The mom might have a legal right to keep it, even if she's not sharing. \n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The mom might be seen as using the kids' funds for herself, especially if she's not providing adequate support. But legally, the court's decision is final unless appealed. The author might feel entitled, but if the court awarded it to the mom, they might not have a legal claim now. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they should get some of the money. If the law says the mom has the money, then the author can't claim it. But ethically, maybe they're right. However, the answer depends on legal standing. If the court's decision is final, then the author's argument is based on ethics, not law. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of feeling entitled, but might not have a legal recourse. The answer would be B (No).\n"
