My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mom got $500k from the dad for unpaid child support, and now the mom isn't sharing it with the kids. The author feels entitled to some of it because the child support was supposed to support them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is money the non-custodial parent (the dad here) is supposed to pay to the custodial parent (the mom) to help with the child's expenses. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, but now the dad is being forced to pay retroactively, that money is technically due to the mom as the custodial parent. Legally, the kids might not have a claim to that money because it's considered a debt owed to the mother, not directly to the children. Even though the purpose was to support the kids, the legal ownership is with the mother. \n\nBut there's also the moral angle. The author argues that the money was intended for the kids, so they should get some. However, the mom was the one who received it, and there's no legal obligation for her to share it unless there's a court order. The mom provided the bare minimum, so maybe the author feels they deserve some compensation now. But legally, the mom has the right to that money unless there's a specific agreement. \n\nAnother point is that the dad's father left him money, which the mom sued over. The court awarded the money to the mom for unpaid support. The dad might have lost out because he didn't pay, perhaps due to the mom's actions. The author is upset because the mom isn't sharing the payout. But the court's decision was based on the dad's past non-payment, not the mom's use of the funds. \n\nSo, the author's entitlement is a moral stance, but legally, the money belongs to the mom. Unless there's a legal way to claim it, the author might not have a valid case. The answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, but they might not have a legal claim. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is expressing a moral claim rather than a legal one, and there's no indication they did anything wrong, the answer is B.\n"
