My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about child support and a payout from the dad's inheritance. The author's mom sued the dad for unpaid child support after he cut it off because the mom wouldn't let him see them. Now, the dad got money from his dad's inheritance, but the mom got $500k in child support, leaving the dad with nothing. The author feels entitled to some of that money, but the mom refuses to share it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's expenses. In this case, the father was supposed to pay support but stopped. The mother then received a payout for the unpaid support. Legally, that money is usually considered the custodial parent's property, even though it's for the child's benefit. The parent has discretion on how to use that money, unless there's a court order saying otherwise.\n\nThe author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18. The question is whether the mom is required to share the retroactive child support with the adult kids. From a legal standpoint, the mother received the money as a judgment, so it belongs to her. The purpose of child support is to support the children while they're minors, and once they're adults, the funds are the parent's to manage, unless the court specifically directed the money to the children.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels they deserve some of it because it was \"meant\" for them. But legally, the mother is the recipient. The author's situation is about feeling that the money was intended for their upbringing, but since they're now adults, the mother isn't obligated to share it. The mom might have used the money for their expenses while they were minors, but that's up to her. The author's claim that the money should be shared now might not hold up in court unless there's a specific agreement or order.\n\nThe author's argument is based on the idea that the money was for their support, but once the support was paid to the mother, it's her property. The mother's decision to keep it is within her rights unless there's a legal requirement to distribute it to the children. The author might be in the wrong because they're expecting to receive money that was legally awarded to the mother, not directly to them as adults. The mother's refusal to share isn't necessarily unethical if there's no legal obligation, even if the author feels it's unfair.\n"
