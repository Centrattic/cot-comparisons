My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some or all of their mom's unpaid child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more often. Then the dad's dad left him a lot of money, but the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the author wants a share of that money because it was supposed to be for the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the legality and ethics of the mom keeping the money. Child support is meant for the child's benefit, right? But once the child is an adult, does the support money belong to the parent who received it? The mom was awarded the money, so legally, it's hers. But the author is arguing that since the support was for them, they should get some now.\n\nI should consider the legal perspective first. Child support is typically paid to the parent who has custody, and once it's paid, it's considered the parent's property. But in this case, the money wasn't paid; it was unpaid child support that was later collected. The court awarded the unpaid amount to the mom, so from a legal standpoint, she owns that money. The author might not have a legal claim to it, especially since they're now adults.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The author feels entitled because the money was originally for their support. But the mom used that money to support them during their childhood, albeit minimally. The author might argue that the money wasn't spent properly, but the mom was the one who received the award, not the kids. \n\nAlso, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. That's a separate issue, but perhaps the author's dad had a right to stop if the mom was preventing visitation. However, the mom then took legal action to collect the unpaid support, which the court granted. \n\nThe author's argument is that since the money was supposed to be for them, they should get it. But legally, once the support is collected, it's the parent's. The author might not have a legal claim, but they're making an ethical argument. The mom might be at fault for not sharing, but the author's entitlement claim might not be justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the money is still considered the child's. Since the support was unpaid during their childhood and the court awarded it to the mom, the author can't claim it now. The mom's right to the money is established by law, so the author is in the wrong for expecting it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
