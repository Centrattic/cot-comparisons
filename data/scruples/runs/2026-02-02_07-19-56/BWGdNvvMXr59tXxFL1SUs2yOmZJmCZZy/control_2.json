My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to their mom's unpaid child support money. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more often. Then, after the grandpa died and left the dad money, the mom sued the dad for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now, the author feels they should get some of that money since it was supposed to support them, but the mom isn't sharing it. The author is upset and thinks they deserve a share, while the mom calls them selfish.\n\nHmm. So, from a legal standpoint, child support is supposed to go to the parent who has custody to support the child. If the dad stopped paying because the mom was blocking visitation, maybe that affects the legal obligation? But the mom did get the money through a court order, so legally it's hers now? But the author is arguing that the money's original purpose was for the kids, so they should get some. \n\nBut legally, once the court awards the unpaid child support to the mother, it's her property. Child support is meant to be used for the child's benefit, but the parent is the one who receives it. So even if the mom didn't spend it well, once it's hers, the kids can't claim it. The author's argument is more about moral entitlement rather than legal rights. The mom might have a legal right to keep it, even if she's not using it as intended. \n\nHowever, emotionally, the author feels wronged because the money was supposed to support them. The mom might be acting out of spite or resentment towards the dad, taking the money away from him. But from a legal perspective, if the court awarded it to her, she owns it. The author can't claim it just because it was for their benefit in the past. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong morally for feeling entitled, but legally, there's no right to claim the money now. The answer might hinge on legal vs. moral perspectives. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the mom was awarded the money through the court, the author's belief might be based on misunderstanding legal ownership. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong morally, but legally, they can't claim it. However, the question is phrased as whether they are in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's feelings are valid, and the mom is the one withholding funds that were intended for the children's support. But legally, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, since the mom was awarded the money, the author has no legal claim, so maybe they are in the wrong for thinking they have a right to it. \n\nWait, but the author's argument is that the purpose was to support the kids. However, once it's awarded to the mother, it's her property. The court's decision is final. So maybe the author is wrong to think they can claim it now. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit confused because the author's reasoning is based on the intended use of the money, not legal ownership. \n\nAnother angle: The child support was meant for the children's support, but the parent is the recipient. The mother might be legally allowed to keep it, but ethically, she should use it for the children. However, since the children are adults now, the mother isn't obligated to share it with them. So the author's belief that they are entitled isn't correct legally, but morally, it's debatable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong in thinking they have a right to the money, then the answer is A. If not, then B. \n\nI think the correct answer is B, No, because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, even if they can't legally claim it. The mom's actions are the issue, not the author's feelings. Or maybe the answer is A because the author is mistaken in thinking they have a claim. This is a bit tricky. I need to check standard child support laws. Typically, child support is paid to the custodial parent for the child's benefit. Once the money is awarded, it's the parent's to manage, even if they don't use it appropriately. So the author can't claim it now, so they are in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
