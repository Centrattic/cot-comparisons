My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to their mother's unpaid child support. The scenario involves the mother receiving a large sum from the father after he cut off support. The mother used that money to settle the child support debt, but now the author and siblings want a share of it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is typically a legal obligation from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the benefit of the child. Even though it's paid to the custodial parent, the funds are meant for the child's support. However, once the child reaches adulthood, they don't usually have a legal claim over those funds. The mother, as the custodial parent, has a legal right to the child support, even if she's the one receiving it.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author feels entitled because the money was \"intended for them,\" but the mother used the father's inheritance to settle the debt. The mother's refusal to share could be seen as keeping money that was meant for the children's upbringing. However, the mother was the one legally owed the child support, so she might have a claim to it as compensation for her expenses during the children's upbringing.\n\nThe father cutting off support because the mother wouldn't let him see the kids complicates things. But the mother's legal right to the child support doesn't change because of that. The recent lawsuit where the mother was awarded the money would have legal standing, so the father was ordered to pay, and the mother received it.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was for them, but once they're adults, the funds are the mother's. The mother might have used the money to cover past expenses, which she was legally responsible for. The author's entitlement might not be legally valid since the mother is the recipient of the child support. However, morally, some might argue the mother should share the money since it was meant for the children's benefit. But legally, the mother has the right to it.\n\nSo considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might not have a legal claim to the money, and the mother isn't obligated to share it. The mother's decision to not share could be seen as keeping what she received as compensation for raising the children. The author's argument that the money was \"intended\" for them might be more of a moral stance rather than a legal one. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because they don't have a legal entitlement to the money once they're adults.\n"
