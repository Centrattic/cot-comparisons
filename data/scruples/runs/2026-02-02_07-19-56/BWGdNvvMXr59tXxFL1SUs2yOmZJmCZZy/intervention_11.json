My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting some of their mom's child support payout. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the mom got $500k from the dad for unpaid child support. The dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now the dad's father left him money, and the mom sued to get that money as child support. The author thinks that money should go to them because it's supposed to be for the kids. But the mom is keeping it all.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is usually paid to the custodial parent (the mom here) to support the children. Even if the dad stopped paying, the arrears (unpaid amounts) would typically be collected from him, and the mom would receive that money. So the court awarded the $500k to the mom as restitution for the unpaid support. Legally, that money belongs to her, right? Because the child support was her right as the custodial parent to manage for the children's benefit, even if she didn't spend it well.\n\nThe author is now an adult, so the child support isn't applicable anymore. The original child support was for when they were minors. The payout is a retroactive amount for the time they were minors. The mom used that money, but the author is now arguing that they should get a share. But once the child is an adult, the custodial parent's control over the funds might be more about their own management. So the author might not have a legal claim to that money now.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The mom didn't provide much, but the legal system awarded the money to her. The author's argument is that since the money was for child support, it should go to the kids. But the system intended the custodial parent to receive and manage it. If the mom didn't use it well, that's her responsibility. The kids might not have a right to it once they're adults. So the author might be in the wrong because the money legally belongs to the mom, even if it was meant for their benefit when they were younger. The author's entitlement is more of a personal belief than a legal right now.\n"
