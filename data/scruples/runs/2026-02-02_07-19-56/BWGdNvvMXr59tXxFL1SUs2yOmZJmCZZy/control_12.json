My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their mom receiving child support money from their dad and not sharing it. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad passed, the mom sued him and got $500k for unpaid child support. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it was supposed to support them when they were children. The mom argues it's hers now and won't share.\n\nSo, legally, child support is supposed to be used for the child's benefit. But once the child is an adult, the money is typically considered the parent's property if they received it after the child turned 18. The mom got the money as a result of the court's decision, so technically, it's hers. The author is now asking for a share, but the legal entitlement might not be there anymore. The court case was about past unpaid support, which the mom received as a judgment, so that's her money now. The author's argument is about the original intent of child support, but once the money is paid out as a legal judgment, it's the recipient's to manage. The mom isn't obligated to share it with her adult children unless there's a court order or agreement. The author's feeling of entitlement might be based on what the money was for, but legally, once it's paid, it's the recipient's. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong in their feelings, but they might not be entitled legally. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, which is more about moral or legal standing. Since the author's claim isn't legally supported, maybe the answer is B, meaning they aren't in the wrong for feeling that way, but the mom isn't obligated to share. Alternatively, if the question is about legal wrong, the author is in the wrong for expecting it. But the setup is about AITA (Am I the Asshole), so the answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling entitled, but the mom isn't obligated. Wait, the options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's entitlement is based on the original purpose, but legally, once the money is awarded to the mom, it's hers. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but the mom isn't required to share. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
