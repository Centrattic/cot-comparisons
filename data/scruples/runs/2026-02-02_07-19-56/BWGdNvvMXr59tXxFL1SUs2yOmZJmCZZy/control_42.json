My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died and left money, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the author wants some of that money, but the mom isn't sharing. The author feels entitled because the money was supposed to be for the kids' support. The mom called them selfish, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's start with the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid to the parent who has primary custody to cover the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying, maybe the mom could have taken legal action to enforce it. But in this case, the dad's father left money, and the mom used that to claim the unpaid child support. So the court awarded her $500k as a lump sum for the unpaid support. Now, the author is arguing that since the money was meant for the kids, they should get some of it.\n\nBut in legal terms, when child support is ordered, it's paid to the custodial parent (the mom here) for the benefit of the children. So even if the money is being used for the children's needs, the parent has discretion over how to spend it. However, once the child is an adult, any past child support would be considered a debt owed to the parent for the time when the child was under their care. \n\nIn this case, the author is now an adult, and the mom is collecting the unpaid child support as a legal judgment. The money is now considered a debt owed to her, not directly to the children. Therefore, the author might not have a legal claim to that money. Legally, the author isn't entitled to it once they're an adult. \n\nBut there's also an ethical angle. The author feels the money was intended for them. However, child support is a financial obligation from the parent to the parent for the child's care. The mom was the one receiving the support, and she used it as she saw fit, even if it was minimal. The fact that the author's childhood was less luxurious doesn't make the mom legally or ethically obligated to share the past child support with the now-adult children. \n\nThe mom's decision not to share the money might be seen as selfish in an ethical sense, but legally, the author doesn't have a claim. The author's argument is that the money was for the children, but once the child is grown, the matter is between the parents. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical perspectives, the author is not in the wrong in terms of their feelings or their reasoning, but legally, they don't have a right to that money. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal entitlement, then B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't wrong for feeling they should get it if they think it's fair. But if the answer is based on actual legal rights, then the author isn't entitled, so they might be in the wrong for expecting it. Wait, no\u2014the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. If the author is not legally entitled, then their belief could be considered wrong. But maybe the question is more about moral responsibility. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just legally. The mom used the money to settle past child support, which was a debt to her. The author's expectation is that since the money was for the children, they should get it. But once the child is grown, the parent can decide what to do with the money. The author's argument is that the money was intended for the children's support. However, the money is now in the mom's possession, and she's not obligated to share it. \n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong for expecting to get some of the money, if the law doesn't support that, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the question is about morality, it's more subjective. The author might feel it's unfair, but the mom isn't legally required to share. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Based on the information, the author is not legally entitled, so their belief in entitlement is incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong). But wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. If the author isn't actually entitled, then their thinking they are might be wrong. However, the author's reasoning is that the money was for the children, so they might feel it's fair. But legally, the money belongs to the mom. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's belief is based on a misunderstanding of how child support works. Child support is a payment to the custodial parent, not a direct payment to the child. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for thinking they are entitled to the money. So answer A.\n"
