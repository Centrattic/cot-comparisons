My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the mother suing the father for unpaid child support after he cut it off because the mom was preventing him from seeing the kids. Now the dad got money from his father's estate, the mom got $500k through the lawsuit, and the author feels entitled to some of it, but the mom isn't sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is typically a payment from the parent to the custodial parent for the child's benefit, right? So when the dad stopped paying, the mom took legal action to get back the money that was owed. But once the child is 18, the legal obligation for child support usually ends, depending on the jurisdiction. The author is an adult now, so the mom might have the right to that money as part of her past support payments.\n\nLegally, the child support was money the dad was supposed to pay in the past. The court awarded it to the mom, which means she's the legal recipient. The author is now arguing that the money should be shared, but once the child is grown, the custodial parent can use that money as they see fit unless there's a specific agreement. So the author might not have a legal claim to the funds.\n\nEthically, the author's argument is that the money was intended for their upbringing, so they should get some of it. But the mother is also entitled to her own decisions about how to use the money she's been awarded. The author's childhood was modest, but the mother provided the basics. The dad cutting off support because of visitation issues is another point\u2014maybe the mother was at fault there, but the court's decision now is about recovering past support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's the case. The author's entitlement is based on the idea that the money was meant for them. However, once the child is no longer a minor, the custodial parent's rights to the funds are clear. The mom might have a right to keep it, especially if there's no court order requiring her to share with the now-adult children. The author's resentment is understandable, but legally and ethically, the mom might not be obligated to give them any of it. So the answer is A.\n"
