My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the mom receiving a $500k child support payout from the dad, who's now left with nothing after his father's inheritance. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it was intended for them as kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is typically a legal obligation from the parent to the child through the custodial parent. So, if the mom was the custodial parent and the dad was ordered to pay, the payments are meant to support the children through her. Once the money is given to her, it's her responsibility to use it for the kids. However, once the kids are adults, the custodial parent isn't obligated to share past payments. The $500k is likely a reimbursement for past unpaid support, so it's not new money for the children now.\n\nEmotionally, the author might feel wronged because their dad cut off support due to the mom's actions, and now the mom is taking money from the inheritance. But legally, the court awarded it to the mom because she was the custodial parent. The author's argument that the money was \"intended for them\" might not hold up because once the support is paid (even if it was overdue), the money is the custodial parent's to manage, unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nThe mom's actions of not sharing could be seen as greedy, but the author's claim might be based on a misunderstanding of how child support settlements work. The author might be conflating the purpose of child support with a direct transfer to themselves. Since the money is already given to the mom, the author's entitlement is questionable. The legal system's role here was to compensate for the unpaid support owed to the children via the custodial parent. The author's request for a share now could be seen as trying to circumvent that process.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might be in the wrong for expecting a share of money that was legally awarded to the mom as reimbursement for past support. The entitlement is based on a misinterpretation of child support's purpose and distribution.\n"
