My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom getting a bunch of money from their dad's unpaid child support, which was settled after their dad inherited a lot from his father. The mom is now keeping all that money and not sharing it with her kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects here. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the benefit of the children. In this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, not paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then, when the dad inherited money, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now she's keeping it all.\n\nThe author is arguing that since the child support was meant for them, they should get some of that money. But legally, once the court orders the child support to be paid to the custodial parent, that parent is the one who gets the funds. Even though the money was intended for the children, the custodial parent is the legal recipient. So the author might not have a legal claim to that money now.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author feels entitled because the money was for their support. But the mom is the one who was awarded it, and she's not sharing. The question is whether the author is right to feel entitled. Legally, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the money was meant for them, but legally, the mom is the recipient. However, the actual ownership might be a gray area.\n\nBut courts usually allocate child support to the custodial parent for the children's benefit. If the mom used it appropriately, maybe the children don't have a claim now. But if she didn't provide adequately, maybe there's a moral argument. However, the author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended once they turned 18. The $500k is a retroactive payment for past unpaid support, which the court awarded to the mom. So the author might not have a legal right to it now.\n\nSo the answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. The mom was awarded the money, but the author's claim is based on the original intent of child support. However, the legal ownership is with the mom once it's paid. But maybe the author's perspective isn't wrong, but the reality is that they can't claim it. The answer would be B because the author's feeling is justified, but legally they might not have a case. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If they're not in the wrong, then B is correct.\n"
