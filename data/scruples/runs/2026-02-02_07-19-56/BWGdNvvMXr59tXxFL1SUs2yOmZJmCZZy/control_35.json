My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they deserve some of their mom's child support award. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad stopped child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, but now he got money from his dad's inheritance. The mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. Now, the author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to be for the kids, but the mom isn't sharing it. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for wanting it.\n\nSo, child support is money the parent (dad) is supposed to pay to the custodial parent (mom) for the child's benefit. But once it's paid, it becomes the mom's money to use as she sees fit, right? The legal aspect here is important. Even if the money was intended for the kids, once it's paid to the mom in a court award, it's her money. The mom isn't legally obligated to give it back to the kids. \n\nThe author might feel entitled because the money was meant for them, but legally, once the mom receives it, it's hers to manage. The author's argument that the purpose is to support the kids is valid, but the court's decision makes the mom the recipient. The mom's actions of suing might have been to recover the money they were supposed to use for the kids, but she isn't required to redistribute it. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but expecting the mom to share that money might not be legally justified. The mom isn't in the wrong for keeping it, even if the author believes it was meant for them. So, the author might be in the right to feel that way, but the mom isn't obligated to share. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, I need to make sure there's no legal obligation here. If the child support was paid directly to the child, it's different, but since it's paid to the parent, it's their money. So, the author's entitlement is a personal belief but not a legal claim. So the answer is B.\n"
