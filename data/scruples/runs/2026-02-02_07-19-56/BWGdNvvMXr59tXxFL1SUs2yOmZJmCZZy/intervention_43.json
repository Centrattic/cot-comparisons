My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling entitled to their mom's unpaid child support settlement. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider legal and moral angles.\n\nFirst, legally, child support is a payment from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's upbringing. Once the support is paid or owed, it's typically considered the custodial parent's money to use for the child's needs. The mom received a lump sum for unpaid child support, which is now hers, even if the dad was the one paying. So legally, the author might not have a claim to that money. The mom isn't obligated to share it unless there's a court order, which there isn't in this case.\n\nMoral-wise, the author feels the money was originally for them. But the mom was the one receiving the support. The author might argue it's their right since it was for their upbringing. However, the mom used the money to support them, even if it was minimal. The author's perspective is that the money should have been distributed directly to them, but the system isn't designed that way. \n\nAlso, considering the mom's actions, she might have used the money for various expenses related to raising them, even if it was basic. The author's criticism of their mom's lifestyle could influence their view, but that's their personal experience. The legal system doesn't typically look at how the custodial parent spent the money unless there's evidence of misuse, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author's dad cutting off support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids is another factor. That might have been his decision, but the mom then took legal action, which worked in her favor. The author now expects their mom to share the settlement, which she isn't legally required to do. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might feel morally entitled, but legally they have no claim. The mom's decision not to share isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they don't have a legal or clear moral claim to the money once it's been awarded to the mom.\n"
