My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom getting a large sum from her ex for unpaid child support, and the author wants a share of that money. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is a payment from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the child's care. Once the child is an adult, the support usually stops. The mom here is the custodial parent, and the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. So he cut off support. Now, when the dad gets money from his father, the mom sued for the unpaid child support, got $500k, and doesn't want to share it with the kids.\n\nThe author is arguing that the money was meant for them, so they should get some. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Legally, child support is paid to the custodial parent, not directly to the children. So once the payments were made (or in this case, the court ordered back payments), it's up to the custodial parent how they use that money. The author might feel entitled, but legally, the mom has control over it because it's for the children's support during their minority.\n\nHowever, there's an emotional aspect. The mom provided only the basics, which the author might feel wasn't enough. But the court awarded the money to the mom as compensation for the support owed. The author's claim is more about feeling the money should go to them now that they're adults. But legally, once the support was paid, it's the custodial parent's responsibility, and she's not obligated to share future assets unless there's a legal agreement.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but legally, they might not have a claim. The court awarded the money to the mom for past support, and she's not required to share it with the now-adult children. However, the author's perspective is understandable, but they might not have legal grounds to demand a share. The answer should be B because the author isn't in the wrong based on legal standing, even if the mom isn't sharing.\n"
