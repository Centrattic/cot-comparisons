My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to claim their mom's unpaid child support. The key points are:\n\n1. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom didn't let him see the kids more. Then he cut off support. Later, when the dad's dad died and left money, the mom sued to get the unpaid child support, which was a big chunk, almost $500k. Now the author (and siblings) feel entitled to some of that money since it was meant for them when they were minors.\n\nThe author's mom is keeping the money, even though the purpose was to support the kids. The author argues that the money was intended for them and not just for the mom. The mom is being called selfish. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent (in this case, the mom) to support the children. If the dad stopped paying and the mom later recoups that money, legally, it's hers unless there are specific provisions. However, the author is now an adult, so the original child support was for their care when they were minors. The money was paid to the mom to cover their needs, but she didn't use it well, according to the author. Now, the mom has this money from the lawsuit, and the author wants a share.\n\nLegally, once child support is paid, it's the custodial parent's money to use as they see fit. So the mom isn't obligated to share it with the children after the fact. The author's argument is more about moral entitlement rather than legal rights. However, the author is arguing that the money was originally for their benefit, so they should get some now. But the problem is that the child support was not a trust for the children's future; it was intended for their upbringing. If the mom used it for their needs when they were children, she might have already fulfilled that duty. However, if she didn't use it properly, that's a different issue.\n\nBut legally, the author probably doesn't have a claim. Morally, it's debatable. The author might feel wronged because the money was meant to support them, but the mom's actions during their upbringing were lacking. However, once the support was paid, it's the parent's to manage. The author's resentment is about the mom's past decisions, but the current situation is about her keeping the recovered funds. The author's position might be seen as understandable from a moral standpoint, but legally, the author is not entitled.\n\nSo the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. But wait, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no. If the author is not legally entitled, but feels morally entitled, is that their fault? The community might see the author as not in the wrong for feeling that way, especially given the mom's past behavior. However, the author's claim might not be valid, so the answer might be B.\n"
