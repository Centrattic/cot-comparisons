My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is upset that their mom got $500k from their dad in unpaid child support, which was taken from the inheritance the dad received from his father. The author feels entitled to some or all of that money because it was originally supposed to support them as kids. The mom, however, is keeping it all and not sharing with her kids. The author argues that since the child support was supposed to support the kids, they should get some of it now. The mom called them selfish and ungrateful.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the legal aspects here. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent for the benefit of the children. So in this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, paying child support to the mom. But he stopped because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then later, when the mom sued for unpaid child support, the court awarded her the money. Now, the author is saying that since the money was for the kids, they should get it now. But legally, isn't that money already paid to the mom? Once child support is paid, it's considered the custodial parent's responsibility to use it for the child's needs. So if the mom didn't use it properly, maybe that's a different issue, but the money is hers unless there was a specific court order stating otherwise.\n\nThe author is arguing that the purpose of child support was to support the kids, so they should get the money now. But once the support is paid, it's up to the custodial parent how they use it. So even if she didn't spend it on nice things, legally, she's the one who received it. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally, they might not have a claim. Unless there's a legal mechanism to claim a share of past child support, which I'm not sure exists. The mom might have a legal right to keep that money as it was awarded to her.\n\nEthically, maybe the author has a point. The mom used the money to get back from the dad, which might not have been the original intent. But the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. That's a separate issue between the parents. The author's argument is that the money was for them, but once the support is paid, it's the custodial parent's discretion. So the author might be in the wrong because the money was already awarded to the mom, and she's not obligated to share it with the kids now. Unless there's a court order that specifies the money should be held for the kids, which there doesn't seem to be. The author's entitlement might not be legally valid, so they might be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, what if the mom used the money to collect from the dad, and now the author is saying they should get a share because it was meant for them? Maybe there's a way to argue that the money should be a trust or something? But I don't think past child support is structured that way. Once the dad stops paying, the mom can sue for arrears, but that's separate from the kids having a claim now. Unless there's a statute of limitations or a way for the kids to claim it after they're adults. But I don't think that's the case. So legally, the author might not have a right to that money. Ethically, maybe the mom is being stingy, but the author's claim might not hold up. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
