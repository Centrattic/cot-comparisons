My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for feeling entitled to part of the unpaid child support from their mom's lawsuit against their dad.\n\nFirst, the background: The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. The dad and child are now closer. The dad's father left him a lot of money, which the mom used to sue for the unpaid child support. She got $500k, and now she's not sharing it with her kids. The child thinks they should get some of it since it was for child support.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the legal and moral entitlement. Legally, child support is money intended for the child's support, paid by the parent. If the mother received it through a lawsuit, does that make it hers to keep? Or does it belong to the children?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, child support is considered the child's right, not the custodial parent's. However, once the support is paid to the custodial parent, it's typically up to them to use it for the child's benefit. But in this case, the money wasn't paid as ongoing support; it's a retroactive collection from a lawsuit. So, the mother was awarded the unpaid support, which might mean legally she owns it now. But there's a moral argument that the money was meant for the children's upbringing, not the mother's gain.\n\nThe mom's actions complicate things. She provided only the bare minimum, so the kids didn't benefit much. The dad stopped support due to the mom's restrictions on visitation. The lawsuit resulted in the mom getting a large sum, which she's not sharing. The child feels entitled because the support was intended for them.\n\nLegally, if the court awarded the money to the mother as part of the child support claim, it might be her property now. However, morally, there's a case that the children should share in it since it was for their benefit. In some places, if a parent receives a large sum related to the child's support, there might be a legal obligation to use it for the child's benefit, especially if the child is still a minor. But here, the kids are likely adults now, given the context.\n\nThe mom's not sharing it could be seen as selfish, but if the law says she owns it, then maybe she can do as she wishes. The user's argument is that since the money was for the kids, they should get some. But if the court's decision was final, the mother might have the right to keep it. However, the user's situation is a bit of a gray area. The original child support was supposed to benefit the children, and the mother's actions in withholding visitation led to the dad cutting off support. Now, the mother is using a lawsuit to get money that was supposed to support the kids, then keeping it. That could be seen as exploiting the legal system to her advantage.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the answer hinges on legal vs. moral perspectives. Legally, if the court awarded the money to the mother, she might have the right to keep it. Morally, the user might have a valid point if the money was meant for the children's support. However, the user might still be in the wrong if they're arguing to take funds that the court has already legally transferred to the mother. But if the court's decision was based on the mother's claim (as the custodial parent), then the mother might be the rightful recipient, even if she uses it for herself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the money was intended for their support, and the mom's refusal to share it could be seen as selfish, even if it's legally hers. Alternatively, if the court's decision was final, the author might be in the wrong (A) for trying to claim money that now belongs to the mother. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for feeling entitled. The author's entitlement is based on the original purpose of the money, which is a moral stance, not a legal one. Therefore, the author's feeling is reasonable, making them not in the wrong.\n"
