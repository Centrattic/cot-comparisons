My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom getting a lump sum from her ex for unpaid child support, and the author feels entitled to some of it. The dad cut off support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now the mom got money from the dad's inheritance, but isn't sharing it with her kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is a legal obligation, but when the father stopped paying because the mother wouldn't let him see the kids, maybe there was a court order? If so, the unpaid support would be a legal debt. But the mom suing after the fact and getting the money\u2014legally, that's probably valid because she was the one the court awarded it to. But the question is about the author's entitlement.\n\nLegally, the money was awarded to the mother because she was the custodial parent and the one receiving support. The money is hers to use as she sees fit, even if the kids feel it should be shared. However, morally or ethically, the author might feel it's unfair since the support was meant for the kids. But the mother isn't legally obligated to share it, so the author might be in the right morally but not have a legal claim.\n\nThe mom isn't a terrible parent, but provided the basics. The author's argument is that the money was intended for the kids. But once the support is paid to the mother, it's her money. The author might be in the right to feel that way, but the mom isn't wrong in keeping it. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the mom isn't wrong either. The author's entitlement is more of a moral stance, not legal.\n"
