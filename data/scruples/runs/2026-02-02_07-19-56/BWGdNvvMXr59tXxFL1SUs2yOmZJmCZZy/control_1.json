My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking they deserve some of the unpaid child support money their mom received from their dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, but then later the dad got money from his father's inheritance. The mom sued and got $500k for unpaid child support, leaving the dad with nothing. The author feels they should get some of that money since it was for their support.\n\nSo, legally, child support is meant for the child's needs, right? But once it's paid to the parent, it's usually their responsibility to use it for the child. However, in this case, the money was awarded after the dad stopped paying, and the mom kept it all. The author is now an adult, so the support was unpaid during their childhood.\n\nThe mom provided the basics but not much more, which the author points out. The author feels entitled to the money because it was supposed to support them. The mom refuses and calls them selfish. \n\nLegally, once the support is paid to the parent, it's up to them how they use it. But the author is now arguing that since the money was for their benefit, they should get a share. But the support was for when they were minors, and the mom was the custodial parent. The court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, so she's the one who received it. \n\nThe author is an adult now, so there's no legal claim to the money unless there's a specific agreement or court order. However, morally, there might be an argument that the support was to cover their needs, which the mom didn't provide beyond basics. But legally, the mom is within her rights to keep the money as the recipient.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong morally if they believe they deserved better support, but legally, the money belongs to the mom. The answer might depend on whether the question is about legal rights or moral rights. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide between legal and moral.\n\nIn these kinds of questions, sometimes the answer is based on the legal perspective. If the mom was awarded the money, then the author has no legal claim. But morally, there's a case for the author. However, AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers both legal and moral angles. The mom might be seen as selfish for keeping the money, but the author is also an adult and perhaps can't claim it now. \n\nSo, considering both, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because the money was intended for the kids' support, and the mom's refusal to share could be seen as selfish. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any legal nuances. In some cases, if the parent misused the child support, the child might have a claim. But in this case, the court awarded it to the mom, so she's the one who received it. The author might not have a legal claim but could argue that the money was for their benefit. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's stance is about entitlement, the answer might be B.\n"
