My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about child support and a recent payout.\n\nSo, the author's mom sued the dad for unpaid child support after he stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now that the dad inherited money, the mom got a $500k settlement from him. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to support them, but the mom isn't sharing it. The author says the purpose of child support is to support the kids, so they should get some. The mom called them selfish.\n\nHmm. First, I need to recall how child support typically works. Child support is usually paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help with the child's expenses. The custodial parent is supposed to use that money for the child's needs. If the parent misuses it, there can be issues, but the child themselves aren't usually direct recipients. The money is considered the custodial parent's once they receive it, unless there's a court order specifying otherwise.\n\nIn this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom was limiting his access. The mom then later sued for unpaid support. The court awarded the money to the mom. Now, the author is an adult and wants some of that money. But legally, once the support is paid (or awarded in a lawsuit for past due payments), it becomes the custodial parent's money. The kids aren't direct beneficiaries unless the court specifically orders the funds to be used for their benefit, which isn't usually the case. The custodial parent is the one who receives the money and is responsible for using it for the child's needs.\n\nThe author is now suggesting that the mom should share the money because it was \"intended for them.\" But legally, once the money is awarded to the mom, it's hers to manage. The fact that she provided minimal support is a separate issue, but the author's claim to the money now might not hold up. The mom didn't have to use the child support effectively, and the author isn't a legal beneficiary once they became adults. \n\nAlso, the author's dad's inheritance is separate. The child support was for the child's support during their minority, and the settlement was a legal judgment against the dad. The mom was awarded the money, and the author's claim to it now is a personal matter, not a legal entitlement. The mom isn't legally obligated to share the money with her adult children unless there's a specific agreement or court order. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't entitled to the money. The author's argument is more about what's fair rather than what's legally right. The mom made a legal decision to sue for the support, and now the money is hers to do with as she pleases. The author's feelings of entitlement are based on the original intent of the support payments, but once the money is awarded, it's the recipient's property. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're asserting a right to money that was legally given to the mom, and the mom isn't obligated to share it with her adult children. The author should have considered that the child support was meant to be managed by the custodial parent, and the fact that the mom didn't use it to its full potential is a separate issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but it doesn't translate into legal entitlement.\n"
