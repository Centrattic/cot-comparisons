My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about someone feeling entitled to a portion of their mom's unpaid child support money. The mom got $500k from the dad for not paying support, and now the kids want some of it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how child support typically works. Child support is money the non-custodial parent pays to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, then maybe the mom had some role in that. But the court might have determined that he still had to pay, and she sued for the unpaid amount. Now she has the money, but the kids feel it's theirs because it was supposed to be for them.\n\nBut legally, child support is paid to the custodial parent. Even if the money was for the kids, once it's awarded to the mom, it's her property. Unless there's a court order specifying that the money is to be used for the children's benefit and they have a right to it once they're adults, the kids might not have a legal claim. However, there might be moral arguments here. The mom provided only the bare minimum, maybe not using the support effectively. The kids feel the money was meant for them, not just the mom.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, unless there's a specific law in their jurisdiction that allows adult children to claim a portion of past child support from the custodial parent, the mom might be within her rights to keep it. Courts usually give the custodial parent discretion on how to use the funds. So the author's entitlement might be more of a moral issue rather than a legal one. However, the original child support was meant to support the children, so there's a gray area. If the mom is using the money for her own benefit instead of the kids', maybe there's a case for the kids to claim a portion. But without legal precedent or a specific right, the author might not have a legal recourse, making them possibly in the wrong if they're asserting a claim that isn't legally supported. Alternatively, if the mom was the one who misused the funds, then the kids could have a case. But the key here is that the money is awarded to the mom as the custodian, so unless there's a legal mechanism for the kids to reclaim it, the author's position might not hold up. So the answer might be AITA, but whether they're in the wrong depends on legal specifics, but in the absence of that, the mom keeping it is legal, making the author wrong to claim it.\n"
