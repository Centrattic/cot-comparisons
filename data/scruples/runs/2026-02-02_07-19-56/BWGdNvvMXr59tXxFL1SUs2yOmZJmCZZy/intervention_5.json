My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom getting a large sum of money from the dad through unpaid child support, and the kids want some of it.\n\nFirst, understanding child support basics: Child support is a legal obligation from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's expenses. The custodial parent is supposed to use the money for the child's benefit. However, once the child is an adult, the support responsibility typically ends unless there are special circumstances like college or disability.\n\nIn this case, the author is an adult now. The mom received the money as compensation for unpaid support during the time the kids were minors. Since the kids are adults, the question is whether they have a claim to that money now. Legally, the child support was meant to be used by the custodial parent (the mom) for the children's needs during their minority. Once they're adults, the money would belong to the mom as it's considered her debt relief or compensation for the years of support she was owed.\n\nThe author argues that the money was \"intended for me\" and should be shared. But legally, once the support was paid, it's the mom's to manage. The fact that the mom provided minimal support doesn't necessarily entitle the adult children to claim the money now. The purpose of child support was fulfilled by covering their needs during childhood, which the mom did, even if it was basic.\n\nHowever, there's an emotional aspect here. The author feels the mom didn't support them well and wants the money. But unless there's a legal provision allowing adult children to claim past support, the author might not have a valid legal claim. The mom might also have the right to decide how to use the money now that the children are adults.\n\nSo, considering the legal perspective, the author might be in the wrong. Unless there's a statute in their jurisdiction that allows adult children to claim past support, which is rare, the money is the mom's. The author's entitlement might not be recognized legally, even if it feels unfair emotionally. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
