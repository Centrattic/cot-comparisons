My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's mom got a $500k payout from the dad for unpaid child support. The dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more, and now the mom is keeping all the money instead of sharing it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect here. Child support is supposed to support the child, right? But once the child is an adult, does that change things? When the child support was unpaid during the time the kids were minors, the mom was the one receiving it on their behalf. Now that the court awarded her the money, does she have the right to keep it? Or does the money technically belong to the children from the time they were minors?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, child support payments are considered the property of the child, even if the parent receives them. So if there were arrears, those unpaid amounts might be owed to the children themselves once they become adults. However, the court's decision here was to award the money to the mom. Maybe the court considered that the mom was the custodial parent and the arrears were owed to her as the legal guardian. But if the purpose of child support is to support the children, then the mom was supposed to use it for their benefit. If she didn't, could the children claim it later?\n\nAnother angle is the dad's situation. He stopped paying because the mom restricted his visitation. That might have been a legal issue too. If the mom was depriving him of his parental rights, the dad might have had grounds to stop payments. But that's a separate matter. Now, the dad inherited money from his father and the mom sued for the arrears. The court awarded her the money, which left the dad with nothing. The author is upset that their mom is keeping the money instead of sharing it with them.\n\nSo the author feels entitled because the money was for child support, which was supposed to be for them. But the mom was the one who received the award. Legally, if the court awarded the money to the mom, she might have the legal right to do with it as she wishes, unless there's a claim from the children. However, if the children were minors when the support was unpaid, their claim might still exist. But once they are adults, they might have to pursue their own legal action to claim their share.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for them, so they should get some. But the mom might have a legal right to the money as the custodial parent, especially if the court ruled in her favor. Also, the mom provided the basics, which is minimal, but maybe that's all she was required to do. The author feels it's unfair because the money was for their support, but if the mom is the legal recipient, she might not have an obligation to share it unless the children can prove misuse or negligence.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling entitled, but legally, the mom might have the right to keep it. However, morally, there could be an argument that the money should go to the children since it was intended for their support. But the author's claim is based on their interpretation of the purpose of child support, which might not align with legal rulings. Therefore, the author might be in the right morally but in the wrong legally if the court's decision stands.\n"
