My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation: The author's father stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now, the dad's dad died, leaving him money. The mom sued for unpaid child support and got $500k, which she's keeping. The author feels entitled to some of that money because it was supposed to support the kids when they were minors. The mom is refusing to share, and the author is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspect of child support. Child support is money paid by a non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's expenses. Once the child is emancipated (usually when they turn 18), the obligation stops. So, in this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom wasn't allowing him to see the kids, which might be a reason for modification or termination, but that's a legal matter.\n\nThe mom sued for unpaid child support. If she was awarded that money, legally, it's a judgment against the dad. But the money came from the dad's inheritance. Now, the author is claiming that since the money was meant for them as kids, they should get some now. But legally, once the child is an adult, there's no entitlement to past child support. The child support was supposed to go to the custodial parent (mom) to support the children at the time. The mom kept it as part of the judgment. \n\nThe author's argument is that the money should be shared because it was intended for them. But from a legal standpoint, the child support was part of the mom's income when the kids were minors. Once the kids are adults, the mom can choose what to do with that money. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally, they don't have a claim. The mom isn't obligated to share it now. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they're trying to claim money that was already settled as part of the court's decision. The mom has a legal right to the funds, even if she used it for bare minimum support. The author's entitlement is based on past obligations that are now resolved. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
