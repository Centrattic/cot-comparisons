My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong regarding their mother taking the child support money from their dad and not sharing it with them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is a legal obligation for parents to provide for their children. If the father stopped paying because the mother wouldn't allow more visitation, that could complicate things. But then, the mother sued the father for unpaid child support and got a $500k payout from the inheritance. Now the author feels entitled to some of that money since it was supposed to support them.\n\nLegally, child support is paid to the custodial parent (the mother in this case) to cover the child's needs. The mother has the discretion over how to use that money for the children's benefit. So even if she didn't use it well, the money is hers to manage. The author is an adult now, so they might feel entitled because they were the intended beneficiaries, but legally, once the child support is paid to the mother, it's her money. \n\nEthically, the author's argument is that the money was for them, but the mother isn't sharing. However, the mother isn't under any legal obligation to give that money to her children. The author was an adult when the support was collected, so the claim isn't valid anymore. The father cutting off support was his choice, maybe due to the mother's actions, but that's a separate issue.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they're expecting money after they're adults, and the legal framework doesn't support that. The mother used the court's decision to get the money, which was a legal action. The author's entitlement is based on past support, but once the child is grown, the support obligation ends. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
