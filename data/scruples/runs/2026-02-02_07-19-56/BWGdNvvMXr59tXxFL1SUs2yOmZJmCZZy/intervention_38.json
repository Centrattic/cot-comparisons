My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong regarding the situation with their mom and dad's unpaid child support.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now, the dad's dad passed away and left him money. The mom sued and got $500k for the unpaid child support, and she's keeping it instead of sharing with the kids. The author feels entitled to some of it because it was supposed to be for them when they were minors. The mom thinks the kids are selfish for wanting any of it.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they deserve some of that money. Let's break down the legal and ethical aspects.\n\nLegally, child support is typically paid by the parent to the custodial parent (in this case, the mom) for the benefit of the children. If the dad didn't pay, the mom could sue him for past due support. Once the judgment is made, the money is awarded to the custodial parent. But once the child turns 18, they usually can't claim the money directly unless there's a specific trust or something set up. So legally, the mom might have the right to that money now.\n\nEthically, it's a bit trickier. The author argues that the money was originally intended for their support, and since it's a large sum, they should get some. The mom, however, might argue that she used the money she received to support the kids during their childhood, even if it was minimal. But the kids are now adults and might feel entitled to compensation for the lack of resources during their upbringing.\n\nAnother point is that the dad's inheritance was used to settle the unpaid child support. The mom received the money, but the dad might have had a different intention for the inheritance. The author's perspective is that the money was meant to support them as kids, not for the mom to keep as a lump sum after they're grown.\n\nHowever, the legal system generally doesn't allow adult children to claim past child support directly once they're emancipated. The custodial parent is the one who receives the support payments, and any arrears would be owed to them. So the author's legal claim might not hold, but the ethical argument is that the money was supposed to benefit the kids, not just the mom.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong ethically but could be legally. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal standing, then the author is in the wrong because the money is awarded to the mom. If based on ethics, maybe not. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The answer should be based on whether the author is in the wrong, not just legal but overall.\n\nSo the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because legally, the mom received the money, and the author can't claim it once they're adults. Ethically, it's debatable, but the legal system's stance is that the custodial parent is the one entitled to the past support payments.\n"
