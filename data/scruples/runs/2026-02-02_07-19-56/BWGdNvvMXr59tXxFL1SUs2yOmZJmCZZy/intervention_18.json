My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's mom sued the dad and got $500k for unpaid child support, which was from the dad's inheritance. Now the author wants some of that money, arguing that child support is meant for the kids. The mom refuses and calls the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent (in this case, the mom) to cover the child's needs. Even if the dad stopped paying, the mom had the legal right to sue for the unpaid child support. The court awarded that money to her, so legally, it's hers now. The author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18. So the money the mom received is part of her legal settlement. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author might not have a claim to that money. Once the support was paid to the mom, it's her money to manage. The author's argument is about the original intent of the child support, but the law usually treats these payments as going to the parent to support the child. Once paid, it's considered the parent's responsibility to use it appropriately. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel wronged because they believe the money was meant for them, especially since their childhood wasn't great. But the law and the court's decision are based on legal obligations, not necessarily emotional or subjective assessments of the parent's spending habits. The mom might have used the support money as she saw fit, even if the author feels it wasn't enough. That's a tough situation, but legally, the author might not have a valid claim.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the money is legally the mom's after the lawsuit. The author's argument about the intended use doesn't change the legal ownership. The mom's decision not to share it is within her rights. The author's entitlement might stem from personal feelings, but legally and ethically, they might not have a right to that money now.\n"
