My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the scenario is about a parent (the mom) getting a large sum from the dad for unpaid child support, and the kids want some of that money. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal aspects. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent to cover the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, maybe there's a legal history there. But the mom now got the money from the dad, and she's keeping it. The author argues that since the money was for child support, it should be used for the kids, but the mom isn't sharing it now.\n\nLegally, when child support is awarded, it's considered the property of the custodial parent. That means once the money is paid to the mom, it's hers to use as she sees fit, even if it's supposed to be for the child's benefit. So even though the intention was to support the kids, once it's in the mom's hands, it's hers. The author wants to claim a portion, but legally, that might not be possible unless there's a specific agreement or court order that directs the funds to be shared with the children later.\n\nThe mom's argument that she's entitled to keep it because it's her money now might hold up. The author's argument is more about the intended use, but once the funds are in her possession, they're no longer a legal responsibility of the dad to the kids directly. However, emotionally, the author might feel wronged because the money was meant for them. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just feeling wronged.\n\nAlso, the mom's reasons for keeping the money could be her own. She might have spent it on the kids in the past, or she might be saving for their future, even if the author didn't perceive it that way. The author's perception that the mom provided only the bare minimum doesn't legally justify the mom having to share the money now. It's more about the legal ownership once the child support is paid.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong), because the money, once given as child support to the mom, becomes her property. The author might not have a legal claim to it, even if the funds were originally intended for the children's support. The mom's decision to keep it is within her rights, so the author's entitlement might not be valid in this context.\n"
