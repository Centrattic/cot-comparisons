My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a mom getting a large sum from the dad's inheritance to cover unpaid child support, and the kids want a share.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad got money from his father's inheritance, the mom sued and got $500k for unpaid support. Now the kids think they should get some of that money since it's meant for their support. The mom isn't sharing, and the author feels entitled but the mom calls them selfish.\n\nThe question is about legal and moral rights. Legally, child support is supposed to go to the parent who has custody, which in this case is the mom. Once the money is awarded to her as part of a court judgment, it's typically hers to manage. The dad stopped paying because the mom was limiting his access, which might be a separate issue, but the court awarded the support to the mom. So legally, the kids might not have a claim to that money because it's already been assigned to the custodial parent.\n\nMorally, the argument is that the support was meant to benefit the children. However, once the money is in the mom's hands, she's responsible for using it for the children's support. The fact that the mom provided only the basics might affect how the money was used, but the court's decision doesn't automatically entitle the children to a direct share. The mom might have obligations to the children regarding their support, but that's her responsibility, not the children's right to the funds once they're in her possession.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the money was intended for them, but legally, the funds are the mom's. The mom's use of the support money is her obligation, but the children can't directly claim the money once the court has awarded it to her. So from a legal standpoint, the author is in the wrong. Morally, it's a different story, but the question seems to focus on the \"Am I the Asshole\" aspect, which often considers both legal and moral aspects.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
