My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to their mom's unpaid child support. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the situation is that the dad was supposed to pay child support but stopped because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now, the dad inherited a lot of money from his dad, and the mom sued for the unpaid child support, got $500k, and isn't sharing it with her kids. The author feels entitled to some of that money since it was meant for them. The mom called them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is typically paid to the parent who has custody to support the child. If the dad stopped paying because the mom was blocking visitation, maybe there were legal consequences. But once the court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, does that money become hers or is it still for the child's benefit?\n\nFrom what I remember, child support is meant to cover the child's needs. If the parent who received the support isn't using it for the child, can the child claim it? But once the support is paid, it becomes the custodial parent's money to use as they see fit. However, in this case, the support was unpaid, and now the mom is getting a judgment for the past due amount. If the court awarded it to her, it's her money, right? But maybe there's a provision that even if the parent gets the money, it's for the benefit of the child?\n\nBut the child isn't a party to the lawsuit. The mom is the one who received the judgment. So legally, the money belongs to the mom. The child might not have a claim to it unless there's a specific law that says the child can claim back the support. However, once the support is collected, the custodial parent is supposed to use it for the child. If they don't, maybe they could be liable. But that's a different issue.\n\nThe author's argument is that since the money was for them, they should get some. But legally, once the mom gets the judgment, it's her money. The fact that she didn't spend it on them before doesn't make her obligated to share now. Unless there's a trust or something, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the mom provided the bare minimum. But that's her choice with her own money. The child support wasn't paid, so maybe the mom didn't have that extra to spend on other things. But once she got the judgment, it's her money to do with as she likes. So the author is asking for money that was owed to the custodial parent, not directly to the child. Therefore, the author might not have a legal claim, but maybe an ethical one.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the money was intended for the children's support and should be used for them. But the mom is the one who was awarded it, and she's not sharing. Is that fair? It's a moral question. But the author is now an adult, so maybe there's no obligation for the mom to share unless there's a legal agreement. \n\nThe author's position is that they deserve some of the money because it was meant for them. But the mom's position is that it's her money. Legally, the mom is correct. The author might be in the right ethically, but legally, they're in the wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
