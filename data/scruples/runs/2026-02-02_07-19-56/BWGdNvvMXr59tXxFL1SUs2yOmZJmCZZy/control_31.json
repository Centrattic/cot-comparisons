My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom getting a large sum from their dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects here. Child support is money paid by a non-custodial parent to help support the child. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, that might affect the legal responsibility. But the mom sued and got the money. Now she's keeping it all, and the author thinks they should get some.\n\nLegally, once child support is paid, it's usually considered the custodial parent's money because they manage it for the child's needs. But in this case, the money was for unpaid support, which the court awarded to the mom. So maybe the author isn't legally entitled to it anymore. However, the author argues that the purpose of child support is for the kids, so they should get some. But once it's paid to the mom, it's hers, right? Unless there's a specific agreement or law that allows children to claim that money after the support is paid.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels it's unfair because the mom didn't provide much and now she's keeping the money. But the mom might have a right to it if the court decided that. The dad got money from his dad, then the mom got the child support from him. The author is upset because they think the money should go to them, but maybe the mom is legally allowed to keep it.\n\nAnother angle: when the dad stopped paying, maybe he wasn't fulfilling his responsibility, but the mom took legal action and got compensation. Now, she's not sharing it. The author's argument is that the money was supposed to support them, so they should get some. However, once the court orders the payment, it's up to the custodial parent to use it as they see fit. The author might not have a legal claim to the money once it's been paid to the mom.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might say the mom is being selfish, but legally, she might have the right. The author is frustrated because the money was intended for them, but maybe the legal system doesn't work that way. The author's entitlement might be emotional rather than legal.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author has a legal right to that money. If not, then they're not in the wrong for feeling that way, but they might not have a legal claim. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally. Since the mom got the money through a legal judgment, keeping it is within her rights. The author's desire for a share, while understandable, might not be justified legally. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, but the mom's actions are legal. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong, not if they have a claim. If the author is in the wrong for expecting it, then A. But if they're not in the wrong, then B.\n\nI think the key here is legal versus moral. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling they deserve it because the support was for them. But legally, the mom has the right to the money. The question is about being in the wrong, so if the answer hinges on legal rights, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. However, if the question is about moral wrong, maybe the author isn't wrong either. The answer is probably B.\n"
