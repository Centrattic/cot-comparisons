My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mom receiving a large sum from the dad's inheritance to cover unpaid child support, and the author wants to claim some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how child support typically works. Child support is a payment from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help with the child's expenses. In this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, paying support every other weekend. The mom stopped allowing more time with the dad, leading him to cut off support. Now, the dad's father left him money, and the mom sued to get back the unpaid support, which was awarded as $500k.\n\nThe author is arguing that since the child support was intended to support them (the kids), they should get some of that money. The mom is keeping it all, and the author feels entitled to a share. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, when child support is ordered, the custodial parent receives the funds to cover the child's needs. Once the money is awarded, it's up to the custodial parent how to use it, unless there's a specific court order stating otherwise. So the mom might have the right to keep it as her own, even if it's meant to support the kids. However, ethically, the money was supposed to go towards the kids' support, so if the custodial parent isn't using it for that purpose, there might be an argument for the kids to have a claim.\n\nBut in this case, the child support was unpaid in the past, and now the mom is getting a retroactive payment. It's not like the kids are currently under her care needing support now. The author is an adult now, so they might not have legal claim to that money. The mom might have been the one who initiated the lawsuit, so she's the one who received the payout. Unless there was a prior agreement or court order specifying that the kids would get a share, the mom might legally own that money.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The money was for the kids' support, but since they're adults now, maybe the mom used it for other purposes. The author's perspective is that the money was originally theirs, but legally, once it's awarded to the custodial parent, it's their property. So the author might not have a legal claim, but they could feel entitled ethically. However, the mom's actions in suing for the money might be seen as her asserting her rights, and the author's request could be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no legal basis for them to claim it now.\n\nAlso, the author's mom provided the bare minimum, so the author might feel that the money was not used adequately. But even so, the legal structure is that child support is given to the custodial parent, not directly to the children. So unless there's a court order for direct payment to the children, the custodial parent has discretion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not have a legal claim to the money, and since the mom received it through a lawsuit, the author's demand could be seen as ethically questionable. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
