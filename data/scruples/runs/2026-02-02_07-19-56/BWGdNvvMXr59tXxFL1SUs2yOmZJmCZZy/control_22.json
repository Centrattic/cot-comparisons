My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of their mom's unpaid child support. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died and left him money, the mom sued the dad for the unpaid child support, got $500k, and now she's keeping it all. The kids want some of it because it was supposed to be for them, right?\n\nHmm. Child support is supposed to go to the child, but in this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom wasn't allowing visitation. Maybe the dad had a right to stop if the mom was making it hard. But the mom later sued and got the money. Now the kids are arguing that the money should be shared with them.\n\nBut legally, when child support is ordered, it's paid to the custodial parent (the mom here) to support the child. So even if the dad didn't pay, once the mom got the judgment, the money is hers, right? Unless the court specifically ordered it to be given to the kids, but that's not mentioned here. The author argues that the purpose was to support them, so they should get it now. But legally, once it's awarded as a judgment, it's a debt owed to the mom, not the kids. So the mom might have the right to keep it as her own now.\n\nBut morally, maybe the kids feel it's unfair because their mom didn't provide much. But the author's argument is that the money was intended for them. However, the court process might have already finalized that the dad owes the mom, so the kids aren't direct recipients. The mom might have used the money as she saw fit, even if not optimally. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong morally for feeling entitled, but legally, the mom might have the right to the money. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for both legal and moral aspects. Since the author is asserting a claim that they're entitled to the money, but legally, the mom received it as a judgment. Unless there's a law that says kids can claim child support directly, which I don't think is the case, the author's claim might not hold. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they can't legally claim that money. But the situation is complex. The mom's actions were questionable too, but the author's position might not have a legal basis. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they can't claim entitlement to that money once it's awarded to the mom.\n"
