My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a mom receiving a large sum from her ex-husband's unpaid child support, which was awarded after his father left him money. The mom isn't sharing it with her kids, and the author feels entitled to some of it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is typically paid directly to the parent who has primary custody, in this case, the mom. The dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, but that doesn't necessarily mean the arrears aren't valid. The court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, so legally, that money belongs to her. \n\nThe author is arguing that the money was intended for the children, so they should get some. But legally, the support is paid to the custodial parent to cover the children's needs. The mom might have used the money for basic living expenses, but not for luxuries. However, from a legal standpoint, the mother's possession of the money is justified unless there's a court order otherwise. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The kids might feel deserving, but the mom isn't obligated to share it. The author's frustration is understandable, but the question is about right and wrong. Legally, the author isn't entitled to the money. The mom's decision not to share it, while perhaps selfish, doesn't make the author wrong for feeling that way. But in terms of legal or moral wrongdoing, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting the money. The answer would be B.\n"
