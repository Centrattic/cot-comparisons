My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about child support and a legal action taken by the mother against the father. The key points are:\n\nThe dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got a $500k award. Now the author thinks they should get some of that money because it was supposed to support them. The mom isn't sharing it, and the author feels entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect. Child support is a legal obligation from the parent to the child, right? So if the dad didn't pay, and the mom got the money, technically it's supposed to go towards the children's needs. But once it's awarded to the mom, does she have a right to keep it? Or is it considered part of the children's assets?\n\nIn many places, child support payments are considered the property of the child, even if the parent receives them. So if the mom collected child support, she's supposed to use it for the kids. But when the father didn't pay, the court ordered support, and the mom got the back payments, maybe the money is now hers as a debt the dad owed? Or is it still meant for the children?\n\nThe author is an adult now, so the child support is no longer applicable. But the mom used the money from the father's inheritance to get the child support back. The author argues that the money should be shared because it was intended for them. However, the court awarded the money to the mom, so legally, it's hers to do with as she wishes.\n\nAnother angle: the mom might have a right to the money as a result of the court's decision. The father's debt was unpaid, so the mom collected it. The author is now asking the mom to share the money she received, which she isn't legally obligated to do. So even though the money was supposed to support the kids, once it's in the mom's hands, she can choose to keep it.\n\nAlso, the mom provided the bare minimum, so from the author's perspective, they might feel under-supported. But legally, the mom had the right to collect the back support, even if she used it for her own benefit. The author's claim is more emotional and based on the idea that the money should still benefit them, but without a legal basis, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the mom to share it.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the mom received the money through legal means and isn't required to share it. The author's entitlement is based on the original intent of child support, but once the money is awarded to the mother, it's her property.\n"
