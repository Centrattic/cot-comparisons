My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of their mom's unpaid child support.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mom sued the dad and got $500k for unpaid child support. Now the author believes that money should be shared with the kids because it was meant for them. The mom isn't sharing it, saying she's the one who received it. The author feels entitled because the support was supposed to support the kids, right?\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent to cover the children's needs. So if the mom was the custodial parent, the money was paid to her, not directly to the kids. The court awarded the unpaid support to the mom, which might be a legal decision based on who was designated as the recipient. \n\nBut there's also a moral question here. The author argues that the money was for the kids' benefit. Even if legally it's the mom's, maybe there's an ethical obligation for her to share. However, legally, unless there's a court order stating that the support is directly for the children, the mom might have the right to keep it. \n\nThe dad cut off support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. That complicates things, but the court's decision to award the unpaid support to the mom seems to be based on her role as the custodial parent. \n\nThe author's mom provided the bare minimum, so the child support was likely intended to help with the kids' upbringing. But legally, the mom is the one who received the support payments. Now that there's a lump sum from arrears, it's a different situation. The court might not have ordered her to share it with the children unless there was a specific provision for that. \n\nSo from a legal standpoint, the author might not be entitled to the money. The mother received the support payments to cover the children's needs, and the court's award of past support is her legal property now. However, morally, some might argue she should share it, but that's not the same as being in the right. \n\nThe answer depends on legal versus moral perspectives. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is legally not entitled, then they are not in the wrong for feeling entitled, but perhaps they are wrong in expecting a share if the law doesn't support it. However, the situation is more about the author's entitlement belief versus actual legal rights. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong for thinking they are entitled, but legally, they might not be. The question is about the author's perspective, not the actual legal rights. Since the author is expressing their belief, not making a legal claim, the answer would be B.\n"
