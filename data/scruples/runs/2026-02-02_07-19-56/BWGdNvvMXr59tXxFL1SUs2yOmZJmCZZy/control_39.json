My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their mom receiving a large sum from their dad's inheritance, which was used to cover unpaid child support. The author feels they should get some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect here. Child support is money paid by a parent to the other for the child's upbringing. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, then the mom might have legal grounds to claim it. But when the dad got money from his father's estate, the mom sued for the unpaid support. Now she's keeping the $500k instead of sharing it with the kids.\n\nThe author argues that child support is meant for the kids, so they should get some of it. The mom is keeping it all. Legally, in many jurisdictions, child support is considered the child's money, and the custodial parent is supposed to use it for the child's benefit. But once the child is an adult, that might change. Since the author is an adult now, the question is whether the money awarded to the mom is still their money.\n\nHowever, the court awarded the money to the mom to cover past child support. Once it's awarded, it becomes her property, right? Unless there's a way to claim it after the child is 18. So legally, the mom might be within her rights to keep it. But ethically, the author might feel they deserve it because it was intended for their upbringing.\n\nThe mom provided minimal support, so the author feels entitled. But legally, once the child is an adult, the past child support is considered satisfied once paid to the custodial parent. The author might not have a legal claim to the money now. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the money came from the dad's inheritance. The mom used that inheritance to satisfy past support, which might not be the right approach either.\n\nAnother angle: the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't allow visitation. That could be a reason for the court to reduce or suspend child support, but maybe the mom still had a valid claim. If the court awarded her the money, then it's legally hers. The author's argument is that the money was meant for them, but once it's paid to the mom, it's hers unless there's a legal way to claim it as a minor. But the author is an adult now, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the author's claim might not hold up legally. They could be in the right ethically if they feel they were deprived, but legally, the mom has the money. The answer would depend on jurisdiction, but generally, the author might be in the wrong because the court's decision makes the money the mom's. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
