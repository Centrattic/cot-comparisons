My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their mom taking the child support money.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Now that the dad got money from his father's inheritance, the mom sued for the unpaid child support and got $500k. The author thinks they should get some of that money since it was meant for their support, but the mom won't share it.\n\nSo, legally, child support is meant to support the child, right? But once it's paid to the parent, it's their money. The mom received the money as compensation for the child support she was entitled to. However, the child support wasn't actually paid during the time the kids were minors; it was unpaid. So the mom is getting reimbursement for that unpaid support, not future support. \n\nThe author is now an adult, so any child support would have ended when they turned 18. The money the mom received is retroactive for the years the dad didn't pay. But legally, once that money is awarded to the mom, does the author have a claim to it? I think not, because the child support was owed to the mom as the custodial parent. Even if the money was intended for the children's support, once it's given to the mom, it's her property. \n\nThe author's argument is that it was for them, but the legal system awarded it to the mom. The mom might have the right to keep it, even if she doesn't share it with her now-adult children. The author might be feeling entitled because they see it as their money, but legally, the mom is the one who received it. The author's entitlement might be more emotional than legal. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing a feeling of entitlement based on the original purpose of the child support. However, legally, the mom is the one who received the money, so the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The mom might be the one at fault for not sharing, but the question is about the author's wrongness. The author isn't in the wrong for their stance, so the answer is B.\n"
