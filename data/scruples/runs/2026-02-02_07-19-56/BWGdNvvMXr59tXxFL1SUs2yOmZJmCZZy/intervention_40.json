My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting some of their mom's unpaid child support money. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then, after the dad's dad died and left money, the mom sued and got $500k for unpaid child support. Now the author wants some of that money, but the mom won't share it. The author's argument is that the child support was meant for them, so they should get some now. \n\nI need to think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, child support is paid to the parent (usually the mother) to cover the child's needs. Once it's paid to the parent, it's their money. So if the dad owed money that wasn't paid, the mom can claim that debt. The court awarded it to her, so legally, it's hers. So the author might not have a legal claim to it. \n\nEthically, the money was intended for the children's support, but once it's collected by the mother, it's her property. The author is an adult now, so maybe the money is the mother's to use as she sees fit. The mom could be seen as using the money to settle a debt that was for the children's benefit, but since the kids are grown, the mother's decision not to share could be her right. \n\nThe author's argument is that the money was \"meant\" for them, but legally, the mother received it. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally and ethically, it's a gray area. The mom's actions might be seen as using the money she was awarded, which could be her way of handling the situation. \n\nThe author's mom provided minimal support, which the author resents, but that's separate from the child support issue. The author's frustration is valid, but the money in question is a court-awarded debt payment. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they don't have a legal claim to the money, and ethically, the mother has the right to use her awarded funds as she chooses once she's an adult. The answer is A."
