My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mom receiving a large sum from the dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants to get some of that money. The mom isn't sharing it, and the author feels entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects here. Child support is a legal obligation paid by the non-custodial parent to support the children. In this case, the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Then later, the mom sued for the unpaid support, which is now a judgment against the dad. Now, the dad received an inheritance, and the mom got the money from that inheritance for the unpaid child support.\n\nSo, legally, the unpaid child support is a debt owed to the children through the custodial parent. Once the court awards that money to the mom, it's her responsibility to use it for the children's benefit. However, if the mom is keeping all of it despite the original intent, that's where the issue arises. The author argues they should get some of it since it was meant to support them.\n\nBut here's the catch: once the court awards the money to the mom, it becomes her property. Even though the purpose was to support the kids, the legal ownership is with the mother. The author might feel entitled, but the mother isn't legally obligated to share it with the kids now that they're adults. Unless there's a specific court order directing how the funds should be distributed among the children, the mother could keep it. However, ethically, it's a different story. Using the money for the children's benefit makes sense, but if the mom isn't doing that and the kids are adults now, the mother might have discretion over the funds.\n\nThe author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18. The money was awarded for past support when the kids were minors. The mother's decision not to share it now could be seen as her keeping what was owed for their upbringing. But ethically, if the money was meant to support the children's needs back then, and the mother didn't use it for that, the kids might feel it's unjust. However, the legal system's role here has already been fulfilled by the court awarding the money to the mother. The author's claim on the money now is more of a moral or ethical argument rather than a legal one.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because once the court awarded the money to the mother, it's her responsibility, and she isn't legally bound to share it with adult children. The author's entitlement is based on the original intent of the child support, but once the money is in the mother's possession, it's her decision how to use it unless there's a court order otherwise. The mother's actions, while perhaps ethically questionable, aren't necessarily wrong from a legal standpoint. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
