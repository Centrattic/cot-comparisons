My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking they're entitled to some of their mom's unpaid child support. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him spend more time with his kids. The mom then sued him and got a $500k settlement. Now the author thinks that money should be shared because it was intended for the kids, even though they're adults now. \n\nHmm, legally, child support is supposed to go to the parent who has custody, right? The mom was the custodial parent, so the court probably awarded the support to her since she was the one taking care of the kids. The dad stopped paying because the mom was limiting his time. But he cut off support unilaterally, which might not be the right way to handle it. He should have maybe gone to court to modify the support if there were issues with visitation.\n\nNow, the mom got a lump sum for past unpaid support. Once that money is in her hands, it's her property. The author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18. The money was meant to support them while they were minors, but once they're adults, the mom can decide what to do with it. The author's argument is that the money should be shared because it was \"meant\" for them. But legally, once the support was paid to the mother, it's her responsibility to use it for the children's benefit at that time. If she didn't use it that way, maybe that's a different issue. But now they're adults, and she's not obligated to share the past support with them.\n\nThe author might feel entitled because they were the intended beneficiaries, but in legal terms, the money was awarded to the mother as the custodial parent. So the mom isn't in a position where she has to distribute it to her adult children. The author's demand could be seen as selfish, even if their reasoning is based on the original intent of the funds. So, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the mom to share the money now. The answer would be A.\n"
