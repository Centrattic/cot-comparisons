My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves child support and a recent lawsuit.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how child support works. Child support is a legal obligation from the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the child's needs. In this case, the dad was the non-custodial parent, and he stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. But then, the dad got money from his father's inheritance, and the mom sued for unpaid child support, getting $500k. Now the author wants a share of that money, arguing it was meant for them. \n\nSo the legal aspect: child support is paid to the custodial parent (the mom) for the children's benefit. If the mom received the money as a judgment for unpaid support, it's considered part of her assets. Legally, once the money is in her possession, the children don't have a direct claim to it unless they can argue it was mismanaged. But the mom isn't legally obligated to share it with her kids now. The purpose of child support was fulfilled by paying the mom during the time the kids were minors. After the kids are adults, the money becomes the mom's to do with as she likes, unless there's a trust or specific conditions. \n\nThe moral aspect is trickier. The author feels entitled because the money was for their upbringing, but the mom is keeping it. However, the mom provided the basics but not much more. But from a legal standpoint, the author isn't entitled to the money. The mom used the legal system to get the support she was owed, and now it's her money. The author's argument that the purpose of child support was to support the kids is correct during the time it was paid, but once it's awarded as a lump sum, it's the mom's. \n\nThe author is being selfish, wanting the money now, even though they're adults. The mom isn't required to share. The fact that the dad cut off support because the mom limited visitation complicates things, but once the court awarded the money for past support, the kids can't claim it now. So the author is in the wrong because they're arguing for something they legally don't have a claim to.\n"
