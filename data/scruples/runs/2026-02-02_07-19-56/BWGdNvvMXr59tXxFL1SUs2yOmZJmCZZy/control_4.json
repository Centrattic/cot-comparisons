My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about their mother suing their dad for unpaid child support after he stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids. Now the dad got money from his father's estate, and the mom took most of it through a child support claim. The author feels they should get some of that money since it was for their upbringing, but the mom refuses. The author is upset and thinks they're entitled to a share, but the mom calls them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, child support is supposed to go to the parent who has custody to support the child. But once the child is an adult, does the support money become the child's? I think in most cases, child support payments are for the parent to use for the child's needs. Once the child is no longer a minor, any unpaid support might be considered as a debt owed by the parent, but the collection of that debt would be between the parents, not the child. So the mom getting the money through a legal judgment is likely legal, even if the dad had it coming from his inheritance.\n\nEthically, the author feels entitled because they argue the money was intended for them. However, the money was part of a legal judgment against the dad, so the mom is using her right to claim that debt. The fact that the dad's family provided inheritance is a separate matter. The author's claim that the money should be shared with the kids now might not hold up legally, since the judgment was a settlement for past unpaid support, not a fund to be distributed to the children now that they're adults. \n\nThe mom's refusal to share could be seen as her right, since she was legally awarded the money. The author's frustration is understandable, especially given their upbringing, but legally and ethically, the money might not belong to the kids. The author's entitlement might be based on a misunderstanding of how child support settlements work. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the situation is more about a misunderstanding of legal rights rather than the author being at fault. However, the mom's actions are legal, so the author can't claim the money. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's feelings are valid, but they might be mistaken about their legal entitlement. So, the answer could be B, as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but the reality is the mom is legally entitled to the money."
