My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom getting a large sum from the dad for unpaid child support, and now the author wants to claim some of that money. The dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him spend more time with the kids. Then, after the dad's dad died, the mom sued him and got $500k, which was supposed to go to the kids. But the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child support is meant to support the children, but once it's paid or awarded through the court, it's typically considered the parent's responsibility to manage it for the children's benefit. However, once the child is an adult, the argument is weaker unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. The mom might have legal rights to the money since she was the one awarded it. But the author is arguing that the money was intended for them as kids, so they should get some now.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The mom provided the bare minimum, so maybe the author feels they deserve compensation for their upbringing. But the dad stopped paying because he was cut off from the kids. The mom's actions might have contributed to the dad stopping support. Now, the mom is using the court system to get money from the dad, which is legal, but the author feels entitled to a share.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal precedents where child support money awarded to a parent can be claimed by the children. In many cases, once the child is an adult, the parent can use the funds as they see fit. Unless there's a specific trust or agreement, the parent might not be obligated to share. So legally, the mom might be in the right to keep the money.\n\nMorally, it's more subjective. The author's situation is that the money was supposed to support them as kids, but now that they're adults, maybe they feel they deserve it. However, the mom might have had the right to use the money to support the children during their upbringing, even if it was minimal. The fact that she didn't provide luxuries doesn't necessarily mean she was required to share the money now.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's claim might not have legal standing since the money was awarded to the mom. Morally, it's a complex situation where both sides have points. The author could be seen as not in the wrong because they're seeking what was intended for them, but since the court awarded it to the mom, they might not have a legal claim. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not about the mom or dad.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author can legally claim the money. If not, then they might be in the wrong for expecting it. But if there's no legal obligation, then maybe the author is not wrong for feeling entitled. But since the mom received the money through the court, she's the legal owner, so the author's claim is based on moral grounds rather than legal. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for feeling that way, but they don't have a legal claim. The answer is B.\n"
