My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom getting a large child support payout from the dad's inheritance, and the author wants some of that money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal aspects. Child support is typically paid to the parent who has custody. In this case, the mom had custody, so the dad was supposed to pay her. When he stopped paying, she sued and got a judgment. Now she's keeping the money, which was for unpaid support. \n\nThe author is arguing that since the money is for child support, it should be shared with the kids now that they're adults. But legally, once child support is paid directly to the custodial parent, it's their money. The parent isn't required to share it with the children, even if it's intended to support them. The purpose of child support is to cover the child's needs through the custodial parent, so the parent has discretion on how to use it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the money was for their benefit, they should get some. But the law doesn't usually provide a claim for adult children to reclaim past child support once it's been given to the custodial parent. There might be exceptions, but generally, the parent doesn't have a legal obligation to share that money with the kids after they've become adults. \n\nAlso, the mom's actions of suing for the unpaid support were within her legal rights. The dad stopped paying, so she could pursue the arrears. The fact that she used the inheritance money to settle that doesn't change the legal standing. The kids don't have a legal claim to that money now, unless there's some specific provision in their state's law, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author's emotional argument about the money being intended for them is understandable, but legally, the entitlement doesn't extend to adult children once the funds are in the mom's possession. So the author is in the wrong in expecting a share of that money from the mom, who has no legal obligation to distribute it.\n"
