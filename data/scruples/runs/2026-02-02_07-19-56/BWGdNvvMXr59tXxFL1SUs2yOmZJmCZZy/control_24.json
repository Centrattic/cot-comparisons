My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their mom getting a large sum from their dad for unpaid child support, and the author wants some of that money now. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal side. Child support is money the non-custodial parent pays to the custodial parent for the child's support. If the dad stopped paying because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids, then maybe he had a reason. But the court might still require him to pay. Now, when the dad's dad left him money, the mom sued him for the unpaid support. The court gave her $500k, but she's keeping it all.\n\nThe author is saying that the money was meant for them as kids, so they should get some now. But legally, once the child support is paid to the custodial parent, it's their money to use for the child's needs. The mom might have used it for basic needs but maybe not in a way the author wanted. However, once the payment is made, it's up to the custodial parent how to use it, unless there's a court order otherwise. \n\nSo, the author is arguing that since the money was for their support, they should get it. But from a legal standpoint, the mom received the payment as the custodial parent, and it's her responsibility to use it to support the kids. If she didn't provide luxuries, that's her choice, but the money is hers to manage. The author might feel entitled because they think the money was for them, but once the support is paid, it's the custodial parent's money. \n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The author might feel they were deprived and want a share. But the mom might see the money as compensation for her role in raising them. So, the author's claim might have emotional weight but not legal standing. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but legally, they can't claim entitlement to the money once it's paid to the mom. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
