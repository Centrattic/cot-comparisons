My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about child support and a recent legal action. The author's dad stopped paying child support because the mom wouldn't let him see the kids more. Then, after the dad's dad died and left him money, the mom sued for unpaid child support and got $500k. Now the author feels entitled to some of that money since it was for child support, but the mom isn't sharing it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is typically paid to the custodial parent to cover the child's needs. If the dad stopped paying because the mom was restricting visitation, maybe that's a different issue. But once the mom sued and got the $500k, that money was awarded to her. So legally, is that money now hers to dispose of as she wants, or does it belong to the children?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, child support is meant for the child's benefit, even if paid to the parent. But once the support is past due, it becomes a legal debt owed to the parent, not the children. So if the mom got the money through a court order for unpaid support, that money is now hers. However, some places might consider the children's rights if they haven't had their needs fully met.\n\nThe author's argument is that the money was intended for them, so they should get some. But legally, once the support was unpaid and the mom obtained a judgment, the money is considered her asset. The fact that the mom didn't provide much is a separate issue. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally, the mom has the right to the money if the court awarded it to her.\n\nThe mom's actions of suing for unpaid support were within her rights. The author's frustration is valid, especially since the money was supposed to support them, but the legal ownership might not be on their side now. The key point is whether the child support was paid directly to the kids or to the parent. Since it was paid to the parent, the parent can use it as they see fit unless there are specific laws about past-due support being held in trust for the child.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong morally for feeling entitled, but legally, the mom has the right to the money she received. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but that's not the case legally. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is claiming a legal right to the money, but the court awarded it to the mom, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author's claim is more about moral entitlement, then maybe not.\n\nBut the problem is the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking they're entitled. Legally, no, because the money was awarded to the mom. So the author is in the right morally but not legally. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is about the author's claim. Since the author is asserting a right that they don't have legally, perhaps they are in the wrong. Or maybe not, because the mom's actions were legal, but the author's desire is understandable.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. The answer might hinge on jurisdiction, but generally, the money owed as child support becomes a debt owed to the parent once it's past due. So the author isn't entitled to it. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for feeling entitled, but they are wrong in thinking they have a legal claim. The question is whether they are in the wrong for thinking they are entitled. If the answer is about legal vs. moral, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in general.\n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for feeling entitled, but legally, they don't have a right to the money. However, the AITA question is about social/moral wrong, not legal. The author's position is that they deserve some of the money, but the mom isn't sharing. The author's actions (asserting a claim) might not be in the wrong if it's a moral stance, even if legally they can't get it. So the answer is B.\n"
