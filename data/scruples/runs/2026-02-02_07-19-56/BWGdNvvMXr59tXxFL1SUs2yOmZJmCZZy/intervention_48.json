My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother receiving a large sum from the father's unpaid child support after the father's father died. The father had stopped paying due to the mother's actions, and now the mother is keeping all the money from the lawsuit, refusing to share it with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Child support is typically meant to support the child's needs, right? So if the father was ordered to pay child support and stopped, the mother could pursue legal action to get that money. But once the child is an adult, does the child have a claim to that money? I think it depends on the jurisdiction. In many places, once the child is no longer a minor, the support obligation ends, so the unpaid support might be considered a debt owed to the parent, not the child.\n\nThe mother sued the father and was awarded the money. If the court ruled that the child support was owed to the mother as a parent, then that money belongs to her. The author argues that the purpose of child support is for the kids, so they should get it. But legally, the parent is the one receiving the support on behalf of the child. So once the support is paid (or in this case, after the lawsuit), it's the parent's money to manage unless there's a specific reason the child would have a claim. \n\nThe mother provided for the basics but not much beyond. The author is upset because the money was intended for them, but if the money was awarded to the mother in a legal settlement, she might have the right to keep it. The author's argument is more about the moral aspect rather than legal entitlement. \n\nAlso, the father cutting off support because the mother wouldn't let him see the kids might complicate things. But the lawsuit was about unpaid child support, which was a legal obligation. The mother's actions might have led to the father stopping support, but that doesn't change the fact that the court awarded the money to her. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a claim to the money. The mother received it through a court decision, so she owns it. The author's entitlement is based on the original purpose of child support, but once the support was unpaid and then recovered through a lawsuit, the recipient is the parent. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong (A) because the money was legally awarded to the mother, and the author doesn't have a legal claim to it. The moral argument is separate, but the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about legal or ethical responsibility. Since the author's claim is based on a misunderstanding of the legal ownership, they are in the wrong.\n"
