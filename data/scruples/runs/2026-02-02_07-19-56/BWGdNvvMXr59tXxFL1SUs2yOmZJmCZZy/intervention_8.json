My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn\u2019t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.\n\nMy dad\u2019s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.\n\nNow my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would\u2019ve been for me if I were under 18. My mom called me selfish and ungrateful when I told her this. AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong regarding their mom receiving money from their dad's inheritance through a child support lawsuit. The author feels entitled to some of that money, but their mom isn't sharing it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand child support laws. Child support is typically paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent to help cover the costs of raising the children. If the mom was the custodial parent and the dad stopped paying, then the court might award past due support. But once the kids are adults, does that support still belong to them? Or does it go to the custodial parent?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, child support payments are considered the property of the custodial parent once they receive them. Even if the payments were meant for the children's benefit, once they are awarded to the custodial parent, they become part of her assets. So, the mom might have legal ownership over the money, even if it was for the children's support when they were minors.\n\nThe author argues that the money was originally intended for them, but once the child support was awarded to the mom, it's her money. The fact that the dad got a large inheritance and the mom sued to get back past child support is part of the legal process. The author is an adult now, so the child support obligation would have ended when they turned 18 or graduated, depending on local laws.\n\nThe mom isn't legally obligated to share the money with her adult children. The author's frustration is understandable, but if the court ruled that the money is owed to the mom, then it's hers. The author might feel entitled emotionally, but legally, the mom isn't in the wrong for keeping it. The author's accusation of selfishness towards the mom might not hold up because the money was awarded to the mom as compensation for past support. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are claiming entitlement to money that legally belongs to the mom. The mom's actions are within her rights once the court has ruled in her favor. The answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
