There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that the classmate was using their phone during a test, and the person told the teacher, leading to the grade being thrown out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings because it undermines fairness. If someone is caught cheating, it's usually expected that they face consequences. The person reporting might be seen as upholding integrity, which is a positive action. However, there's also the angle of being a \"snitch,\" which can have social repercussions. The reporter might be labeled as a traitor among peers, even if their action was right.\n\nNext, the situation's specifics matter. The person claims they saw the classmate using a phone to get answers. If the test instructions prohibit phones, then the classmate was indeed violating rules. Reporting this to the teacher is the correct procedure. The teacher's response (not counting the grade) is a standard consequence. The reporter didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher, which is the proper channel. \n\nAnother point is the motivation. The reporter mentions that everyone studied hard, implying they wanted fairness. Their action is to prevent an unfair advantage. There's no indication of personal vendetta here, just a desire for fair assessment. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a risk of false accusations. If the person was unsure, they might have acted on a suspicion rather than certainty. But in the scenario, it's stated that it was \"pretty obvious,\" so the reporter had a reasonable belief. \n\nSocial dynamics play a role too. In some groups, reporting can be seen negatively, but academically, it's usually the right thing. The conflict here is between personal relationships and upholding rules. The question is whether the right action depends on the context, but generally, integrity is valued in academic settings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong. They acted to maintain fairness by reporting a clear violation of rules through the correct authority. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
