There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the classmate was caught looking at their phone during a test. The student reported this to the teacher after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade. The student is wondering if they did the right thing by \"snitching.\"\n\nPossible perspectives: On one hand, cheating is unfair, and reporting it maintains academic integrity. The student might feel that others worked hard and deserve a fair assessment. On the other hand, some might argue that it's a personal matter between the cheater and the teacher, and that reporting could be seen as tattling, potentially causing conflict between classmates.\n\nBut in educational settings, policies usually encourage reporting academic dishonesty. Teachers rely on students to report such incidents. The student's action could be seen as responsible, upholding standards. However, the method might matter. Approaching the teacher privately after class is probably the right way. But if the student had done it in front of others, it might be different. Here, they went to the teacher after others left, which seems appropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the student is in the wrong. The key factors are the intent (to report cheating) and the method (private report). Since the teacher acted on it, the system is working as intended. The student isn't in the wrong for doing the right thing by reporting. The answer would likely be B (No), but need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe some might say it's a personal choice, but in most cases, reporting is encouraged.\n"
