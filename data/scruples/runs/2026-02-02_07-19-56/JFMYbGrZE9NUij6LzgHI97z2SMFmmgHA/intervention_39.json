There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate based on the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: the student saw their classmate using a phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the grade. The main question is if the reporter was wrong.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered dishonest, so reporting it might be seen as upholding academic integrity. The student didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher, which is the proper channel. However, there's a possible issue with being a \"snitch,\" which can be seen negatively in some peer groups. But academically, cheating is a violation, so reporting it is the right step.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're thinking about the social aspect\u2014maybe the classmate feels betrayed. However, from an ethical standpoint, reporting cheating is a responsible action. The key points are: did the student act within the rules? Yes. Did they have a valid reason? Yes, observed cheating. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance if there was no proof, but the teacher still took action. But the student did report what they saw, so it's a justified report. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
