There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So the situation is that during a test, the classmate was looking at their phone and writing answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and told them, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is usually considered wrong because it's unfair to others who put in effort. The reporter mentioned that they and others studied hard, so there's a sense of unfairness. By reporting the cheating, the reporter is trying to uphold academic integrity. \n\nBut then, there's the act of reporting itself. Is it right to inform on someone? Some might say it's a betrayal of trust or that the reporter should have confronted the classmate directly first. However, in many educational settings, teachers encourage students to report cheating to maintain fairness. \n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. The classmate might face academic penalties, but the reporter is preventing an unfair advantage. If cheating isn't addressed, it devalues the efforts of honest students. \n\nI should also think about the method. The reporter went directly to the teacher after everyone left, which seems responsible. They didn't spread rumors but approached the teacher privately. That's usually the correct procedure. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the reporter wasn't sure if it was cheating. But they said it was obvious she was looking at her phone. Unless there's a policy against using phones even if it's for notes, but in a test setting, phones are typically prohibited. \n\nSo weighing it all, the reporter likely did the right thing by maintaining academic honesty, even though it might feel like snitching. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
