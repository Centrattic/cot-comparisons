There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers. The reporter went to the teacher after everyone left and told them. The teacher then didn't count the cheater's grade.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the reporter did the right thing. Let me think about the possible angles here.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered dishonest, so reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. The classmate had an unfair advantage, which might affect the integrity of the test results. The reporter mentions that others, including themselves, studied hard, so there's an emphasis on fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the reporter could have handled it differently. Maybe confronting the classmate first or discussing with the teacher in a different way. Also, there's the possibility that the reporter might have misinterpreted the situation. Was it really cheating, or could there have been another reason the classmate was using their phone?\n\nBut in this case, the reporter saw the classmate writing answers while looking at the phone, which is a common way of cheating. The teacher didn't count the grade, so the action was taken. If the teacher agreed it was cheating, then the reporter's action was justified.\n\nAnother point: reporting cheating is usually expected in academic settings to uphold standards. So the reporter might be in the right. But some might say it's snitching, which can have social consequences. However, the ethical side is about doing what's right for fairness.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a violation of academic integrity, which is the correct course of action despite potential social backlash.\n"
