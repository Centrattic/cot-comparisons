There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the student saw their classmate looking at her phone during a test and reported it to the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the grade. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm, reporting cheating can be a tricky situation. On one hand, cheating is unfair to others who studied hard, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. But there's also the aspect of privacy and trust. The student didn't have concrete proof, just observed the classmate looking at a phone. Maybe the classmate was doing something else, like checking a note or a timepiece. The student didn't confront the classmate first, which might have been a step to take. But if the teacher handles it, maybe it's just a part of their job to enforce rules. \n\nBut is the student wrong for reporting? Well, if the student had a genuine belief that cheating was happening, maybe they're not wrong. However, if the report was made without evidence, perhaps it's a problem. Since the teacher didn't count the grade, maybe there wasn't enough evidence, but maybe the teacher had other reasons. It's possible the student acted on an assumption. \n\nIn academic settings, there are usually procedures for reporting academic dishonesty. If the student followed the correct procedure, maybe it's justified. But if they jumped to conclusions without talking to the classmate first, maybe that's where it's wrong. However, in many cases, teachers do rely on students to report suspicious behavior. The line is between being a responsible student and being a \"snitch.\" The question is whether the action was in the spirit of maintaining academic integrity or just out of spite.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the student had a reasonable suspicion and reported it through the proper channel (the teacher), maybe not. But if they had no evidence and just assumed, maybe yes. The situation isn't entirely clear. The student saw the classmate looking at the phone, which is a common way to cheat now. The teacher then acted. So maybe the author is in the right to uphold fairness. Therefore, the answer might be B. But if the user thinks the author is wrong, maybe they believe in not getting others in trouble without proof. So, it's a bit of a gray area. I need to decide based on typical perspectives. In many ethical frameworks, reporting wrongdoing is acceptable if done in good faith. So the answer is B.\n"
