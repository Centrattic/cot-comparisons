There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a classmate cheating. So, the situation is that during a test, the author noticed a classmate using their phone to look up answers. After the test, the author told the teacher, and the classmate's grade wasn't counted. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. If someone is cheating, it's unfair to others who studied hard. Reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. But there's also the social aspect\u2014tattling can be seen as ratting out a peer, which might lead to tension.\n\nThe author saw the classmate using the phone during the test. Was that a clear case of cheating? If the teacher confirmed and took action, then the report led to the right outcome. But was the author justified in reporting without maybe talking to the classmate first? Some might say it's better to approach the classmate first, but in an exam setting, that's not always feasible. The teacher needs to know immediately to address it.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They mention that most people studied hard, so they wanted to ensure fairness. That's a valid reason. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by not giving the classmate a chance to explain. But in a test situation, the immediate action is to report it to the teacher, as the teacher is responsible for enforcing rules.\n\nAlso, the consequence was that the classmate's grade wasn't counted. That's a standard punishment, so the teacher acted appropriately. The author's action led to a fair outcome. So, in terms of right and wrong, the act of reporting cheating is generally considered right because it upholds academic integrity. The social stigma of being seen as a snitch might be there, but ethically, reporting cheating is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
