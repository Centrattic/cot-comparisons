There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who reported their classmate is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation is a test where most students, including the author, studied hard. The classmate in front was seen looking at her phone and writing answers. The author went to the teacher after class to report this, leading to the teacher invalidating the test grade. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by \"snitching.\"\n\nHmm, cheating is generally considered wrong because it undermines fairness. If someone is caught cheating, the usual response is for the teacher to handle it, like not counting the grade. The author observed the cheating and reported it. But is reporting considered snitching in a negative sense?\n\nIn some contexts, \"snitching\" has a negative connotation, implying betrayal or tattling for personal gain. But here, the author seems to be acting out of a sense of fairness, not for personal benefit. The teacher didn't take any action against the author, just invalidated the grade. The classmates who studied hard might feel that reporting the cheater was the right thing to do to maintain academic integrity.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, if there was a way to address the cheating without directly reporting the classmate, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The key point is that the author did report the cheating, and the teacher acted on it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI think in most cases, reporting cheating is seen as a responsible action, even if it's uncomfortable. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
