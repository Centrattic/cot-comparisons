There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a student who reported a classmate for cheating. So first, I need to consider the ethical aspects of reporting cheating. The user says they saw the classmate using their phone to look up answers during a test. They went to the teacher after the test and told them, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The question is whether the reporter is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is dishonest and undermines the fairness of the test. If the student actually observed cheating, reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. The user mentions that they studied hard, so they might feel it's unfair if someone else cheats. Reporting the cheater could protect the grades of others who followed the rules.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of privacy and whether the student had the right to confront the teacher alone. Maybe the student should have approached the classmate first to talk about it, but in many cases, reporting to a teacher is the appropriate step. Also, if the student was certain they saw cheating, it's their responsibility to inform the teacher to maintain fairness.\n\nBut wait, what if there was a misunderstanding? If the classmate had a legitimate reason for using the phone, like a medical device or an authorized resource, but the reporter didn't check, then the reporter might be at fault. However, the user states it was \"pretty obvious\" she was cheating, implying they were confident in their observation. \n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. Snitching can be seen as tattling, which might create tension. However, in an academic setting, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is part of upholding standards. The teacher's job is to ensure fair assessment, so the student's action supports that.\n\nIn many educational institutions, students are encouraged to report academic dishonesty to maintain the integrity of their degrees. So the student did the right thing by following the proper channels. Unless there was no evidence, the teacher would handle it. The fact that the teacher invalidated the grade suggests the report was valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the student acted correctly in reporting the cheating. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
