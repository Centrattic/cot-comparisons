There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was seen using their phone during a test, and the student told the teacher after the test. The teacher then invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it undermines academic integrity. If someone is caught cheating, it's expected that others would report it. However, there might be nuances. For example, was there clear evidence? The student saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing. Phones are typically not allowed during tests, so using one to cheat is a clear violation. \n\nAnother angle is intent. The student came forward after the test, not during, which might be a point of contention. If they reported it immediately, maybe it would have been handled differently. But the student might have wanted to confirm their suspicions before reporting. \n\nAlso, the impact on others: the student mentions that everyone studied hard. By reporting the cheater, they might be trying to uphold fairness. However, some might argue that it's not their place to be a \"snitch,\" but others would see it as doing the right thing to maintain standards.\n\nPossible counterarguments: What if the classmate didn't actually cheat? Maybe the phone was for something else. But the student observed the classmate looking at the phone and writing, which strongly suggests cheating. The teacher likely considered the evidence before invalidating the grade.\n\nMoral responsibility: If you witness cheating, do you have a duty to report it? In many educational systems, yes. Academic integrity policies usually encourage reporting. So the student might be justified.\n\nPersonal relationships: Reporting could strain friendships or create conflict. But the question is about right or wrong, not the consequences. \n\nSo weighing all this, the act of reporting cheating when there's clear evidence is not wrong. The student is enforcing rules and fairness. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
