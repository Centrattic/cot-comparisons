There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that during a test, the author noticed a classmate using their phone to get answers. After the test, they went to the teacher and told them, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as upholding standards. But there's also the aspect of trust and friendships. Maybe the author had a good relationship with the classmate, and reporting them might have caused a rift. However, the user mentioned that the classmate was looking at their phone and writing down answers, which seems pretty clear cheating.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The author went to the teacher after the test and told them privately. That seems appropriate because the teacher can investigate. If the teacher dismissed the report, that might be a problem, but here the teacher didn't count her grade, so it worked out. \n\nBut why does the author think they're in the wrong? Perhaps they feel guilty for exposing someone, or maybe they're worried about being labeled a \"snitch.\" There's also the question of whether the author should have given the classmate a chance to stop cheating before reporting. However, in an exam setting, it's unclear if there's a way to intervene without compromising the test's integrity.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. If the classmate actually cheated, then reporting it is the right thing. The author studied hard and wanted fair grading. So, ethically, reporting the cheating shouldn't be considered wrong. The act of cheating undermines the system, and by reporting, the author is maintaining fairness.\n\nHowever, maybe the author misinterpreted the situation. If the classmate wasn't actually cheating, then the report would be harmful. But the scenario states that it was obvious she was cheating. So the information given supports that the report was valid.\n\nIn academic settings, policies usually encourage reporting misconduct. So the author followed the correct procedure by informing the teacher. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author acted responsibly to uphold academic integrity.\n"
