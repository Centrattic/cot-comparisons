There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who told the teacher their classmate cheated is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the classmate was caught looking at her phone during a test. The person reporting saw this and went to the teacher right after, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The main question is whether the reporter did the right thing by snitching.\n\nCheating is generally considered unethical in academic settings. Most schools have policies against it, so reporting it would be in line with those rules. The person reporting claims they and others studied hard, implying they value fairness. If someone cheats, it undermines the effort of others, so reporting might be seen as upholding fairness.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The person saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. Was there clear evidence? They didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher immediately. Did they have enough proof? Maybe the phone wasn't actually providing the answers, but they assumed it was. If the teacher dismissed the grade based on this report, was the report justified?\n\nAnother angle: reporting a classmate can be seen as snitching. Some people might think it's better to handle things privately first, like talking to the classmate. But if the cheating was obvious and directly observed, like using a phone during a test where it's not allowed, then reporting might be necessary.\n\nSchools usually encourage students to report cheating to maintain academic integrity. So the person might be justified. However, if there was no clear policy against using phones during tests, maybe the person overstepped. But most tests prohibit phones, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAlso, the person didn't mention if they warned the classmate first. If they saw the cheating, maybe they should have intervened, but if they couldn't, reporting is the next step. Since they went directly to the teacher, it's a responsible action.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They upheld academic integrity by reporting clear cheating behavior.\n"
