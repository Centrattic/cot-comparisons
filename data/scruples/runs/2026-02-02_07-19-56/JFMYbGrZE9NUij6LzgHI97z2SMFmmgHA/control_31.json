There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for telling the teacher that a classmate cheated. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was looking at their phone and writing answers. The user saw this, went to the teacher after everyone left, and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the classmate's grade. The user is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others who put in the effort. The user mentions that most of the class, including themselves, studied hard. So there's a sense of fairness here. Reporting cheating could be seen as upholding academic integrity.\n\nBut why might the user be in the wrong? Maybe they didn't have concrete evidence. Cheating can be hard to prove. If the teacher didn't witness the cheating themselves, relying on a student's word might not be enough. There's a risk of false accusations. However, the user saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing, which seems suspicious. Phones are usually not allowed during tests, so that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher didn't count the grade. So the consequence was immediate. If the teacher didn't have a chance to investigate or talk to the student, maybe the user should have let the teacher handle it. But the user reported it after the test, so maybe the teacher had their own process. The user might not have known the proper procedure, like going through the teacher first.\n\nAlso, the user went to the teacher after everyone left. Was that the right time? Maybe the classmate had an allowed reason for using the phone, like a medical device or an accommodation. The user didn't consider that possibility. But the scenario says the classmate was looking at the phone and writing answers, which is more suspicious.\n\nIn some schools, there are protocols for reporting cheating. If the user followed the school's guidelines, then it's okay. If they didn't, maybe they acted impulsively. But the user's intention was to report cheating, which is a positive intent. The outcome was the classmate's grade not counting. If the classmate actually cheated, then the user did the right thing. If not, maybe the user was wrong.\n\nBut without more context, like the school's policies on cheating and how the report was handled, it's hard to say for sure. However, the user acted based on what they observed. Cheating undermines the system, so reporting it is usually encouraged. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the intent was to maintain fairness, even if there's a possibility of misunderstanding. The user took action based on their observation, which is reasonable.\n"
