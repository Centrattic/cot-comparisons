There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether someone is in the wrong for reporting a classmate who cheated on a test. The person went to the teacher and told them, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered wrong. Reporting it can be seen as a responsible action to maintain fairness. The author observed the cheating and reported it without confrontation, which some might view as doing the right thing. However, others might argue that the author should have addressed it differently, like talking to the classmate first or not snitching at all.\n\nBut in academic settings, there are usually policies against cheating. Reporting it is often encouraged to uphold integrity. The author didn't fabricate evidence; they observed the cheating and informed the teacher. So, from an ethical standpoint, the author might be in the right. But some people might think it's betrayal or that the teacher should handle it without student reports.\n\nI need to weigh these perspectives. The key points are the act of cheating and the method of reporting. Since the teacher took action, it seems the report was valid. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
