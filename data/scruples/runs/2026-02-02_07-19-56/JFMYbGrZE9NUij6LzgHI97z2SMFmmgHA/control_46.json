There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about reporting a classmate for cheating. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user observed their classmate looking at her phone during a test, which they believe indicates cheating. Then they went to the teacher and reported it after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade. The main question is whether the user did the right thing by reporting.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is against academic integrity. If the user saw the classmate using a phone during the test, which is likely against the rules, then reporting it could be seen as responsible. The user studied hard, so it's fair they feel upset about unfair advantages.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user didn't confirm for sure that it was cheating. Maybe the phone was for something else, though the scenario says the classmate was writing answers. But the user thought it was obvious. Also, reporting anonymously after the fact\u2014did they have a duty to inform the teacher during the test? Sometimes teachers prefer to handle it in real-time if possible. But the user might not want to confront the classmate directly in front of others, so approaching the teacher after could be a valid approach.\n\nPotential issues: Did the user have sufficient evidence? If they're mistaken, it's a false accusation. But the scenario states they saw her looking at the phone and writing answers, which seems like clear cheating. Also, the teacher's response was to invalidate the grade, implying the report was taken seriously.\n\nSo, considering the intent to maintain fairness and the evidence they observed, the user might be in the right. But if they didn't confirm it 100%, maybe there's a gray area. However, given the circumstances described, the action seems justified. So the answer is B (No).\n"
