There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that during a test, the person noticed their classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. After the test, they told the teacher, which led to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The user wants to know if the reporter is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered dishonest, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do to maintain fairness. However, there might be nuances. Did the person have sufficient evidence? They saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing. But maybe the classmate had a legitimate reason, like using a calculator or taking notes for something else. However, most schools have rules against using phones during tests, so even if it's not cheating, it's still a violation.\n\nThen there's the question of intent. The person reported because they believed cheating occurred. If their intent was to uphold academic integrity, that's a positive motive. But if it's revenge or to undermine the classmate, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention any negative intent, just that they noticed the behavior and reported it.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. By reporting, the teacher invalidated the grade. That affects the classmate's academic record. If the report was based on a misunderstanding, it could be unfair. But if the person acted in good faith, they might not be at fault. Schools usually handle such reports seriously, and it's part of maintaining standards.\n\nAlso, considering the responsibility of students. In many educational systems, students are encouraged to report dishonesty to preserve fairness for everyone. The person might be doing their duty by reporting, even if it leads to conflict.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Reporting a peer can lead to being labeled a \"snitch,\" which might affect relationships. However, the user's main concern is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not socially.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The person observed what they believed to be cheating and reported it to the teacher. If they had reasonable grounds and acted without malice, they are likely not in the wrong. Cheating undermines the system, and reporting it is a responsible action. The answer should be B, No.\n"
