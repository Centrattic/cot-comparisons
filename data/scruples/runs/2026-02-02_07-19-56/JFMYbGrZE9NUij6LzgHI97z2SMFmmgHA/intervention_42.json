There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers. The person then told the teacher after the test, and the teacher didn't count the classmate's grade. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. If someone does cheat, it's against the rules and unfair to others who worked hard. Reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and the potential consequences of false accusations.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have sufficient evidence? The author says they saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. If that's the case, it's plausible cheating. But maybe there's another explanation, like the student was taking notes for later. However, during a test, using a phone to look up answers is typically considered cheating. \n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The author went to the teacher alone after everyone left. Was that the proper procedure? In some schools, there might be specific protocols for reporting cheating, like doing it in front of others or providing evidence. If the author acted alone, maybe there's a lack of corroborating witnesses, which could be a problem if the accusation is false. But the teacher still took action based on the report.\n\nAlso, the impact: The classmate's grade was not counted. That's a significant consequence. The author might have acted out of a sense of justice, but they might not consider the personal relationship with the classmate or the classmate's possible reasons for cheating (e.g., stress, misunderstanding the rules).\n\nOn the other hand, if the teacher investigated and confirmed the cheating, then the author did the right thing. But if there was no investigation and the teacher immediately dismissed the grade, that could be an issue. The scenario doesn't mention an investigation, just that the teacher didn't count the grade.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to uphold academic integrity, which is good. But the method of reporting and the potential consequences need to be considered. If the author is certain about the cheating and followed the right procedure, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they acted without sufficient evidence or caused harm without just cause, they could be in the wrong.\n\nIn many cases, reporting cheating is seen as a responsible action. However, some might argue that it's better to discuss the situation with the involved parties first or seek mediation. But in an academic setting, teachers often rely on students to report such issues.\n\nGiven that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they reported a possible academic violation, which is part of maintaining fairness. Unless there's a reason to doubt the author's intent or the validity of the accusation, which isn't mentioned here. The author observed something suspicious and reported it, which is a responsible action even if it leads to conflict.\n"
