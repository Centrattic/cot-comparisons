There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for reporting a classmate who cheated. The situation is that the classmate was seen using her phone during a test, and the author told the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the grade. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. Reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. However, sometimes people might feel it's snitching, especially if the reporter and the cheater are peers. But the key here is that the author observed the cheating and reported it after the fact, not in a confrontational way. \n\nI should also think about the impact. If cheating isn't addressed, it can undermine the fairness of assessments for others who studied. The author mentions that most of them studied hard, so there's a motivation to maintain fairness. The teacher handled it by not counting the grade, which is a standard response. \n\nAre there any potential downsides? Maybe if the report was malicious, but there's no indication that here. The author acted in good faith. In academic policies, reporting cheating is usually encouraged. Peer responsibility to maintain standards is part of the community.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the student could have approached the teacher during the test or given the classmate a chance to stop cheating. But since the author did report it after the fact and the teacher dealt with it, the action was appropriate. \n\nSo, the consensus is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
