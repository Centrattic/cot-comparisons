There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was using her phone to get answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the cheater's grade.\n\nFirst, cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do. But sometimes people might feel it's snitching. The key points here: the reporter saw the classmate using a phone during the test, which is a clear sign of cheating. The reporter went to the teacher alone after everyone left, which might be considered honest and responsible. The teacher then took appropriate action.\n\nBut maybe the reporter could have been wrong? Like, maybe the phone use wasn't for cheating. But the user says it was obvious, so that's their perspective. The teacher's decision to not count the grade suggests the teacher believed the report. \n\nSo, the question is whether the reporter is in the wrong. If the action was to uphold academic standards and done responsibly, then no. If it was done out of spite or with false information, then yes. But in this case, the user didn't mention malice. They studied hard and saw the cheating. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Cheating undermines fairness, so reporting it is justified.\n"
