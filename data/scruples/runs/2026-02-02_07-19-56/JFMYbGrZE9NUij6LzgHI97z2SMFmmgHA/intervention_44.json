There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where a student saw their classmate using a phone during a test and reported it, leading to the teacher invalidating that test. The user initially thinks the reporter is wrong but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. Cheating in exams is generally considered unethical and against academic integrity. The student observed what they believed was cheating\u2014using a phone to get answers. Reporting this could be seen as upholding academic standards, ensuring fairness for all students, including those who studied hard. However, there might be nuances. Did the student have solid evidence? The user mentioned that the classmate was looking at the phone and writing answers. If it's clear that cheating occurred, reporting it makes sense. But if the student misinterpreted the situation (maybe the classmate was doing something else), then it's a problem. However, the scenario says the teacher invalidated the grade, implying the report was valid.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that reporting a peer could damage the relationship between students, especially if the report was made after the fact without immediate confrontation. Also, there's the aspect of trust and privacy. But in academic settings, maintaining integrity is usually prioritized. The teacher's action (not counting the grade) suggests the report was justified. So, the student who reported might be in the right because they upheld academic honesty. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
