There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user themselves think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author saw their classmate using a phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the grade. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nCheating is a serious issue in academic settings. Schools usually have policies against it. If a student observes cheating, they might be expected to report it. But there's also the social aspect\u2014tattling on a classmate can be seen as snitching, which some people view negatively.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author have a duty to report? The teacher didn't know about the cheating without the report. If the student didn't report, they might be enabling unfair practices. But if they did report, they might be seen as betraying a classmate.\n\nI need to consider the ethics. Honesty and integrity are usually valued. Allowing cheating undermines the system. However, the method of reporting matters. The author reported after the test, privately, which is appropriate. They didn't do it in front of others, so that's a good point.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should handle it differently, maybe talk to the classmate first. However, in many cases, the responsibility to report lies with the student, especially if they have evidence. The teacher's job is to enforce rules, so the student's report is a way to uphold integrity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, maybe because of the \"snitching\" aspect. But in academic contexts, reporting cheating is often encouraged. So the author might be in the right for maintaining fairness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
