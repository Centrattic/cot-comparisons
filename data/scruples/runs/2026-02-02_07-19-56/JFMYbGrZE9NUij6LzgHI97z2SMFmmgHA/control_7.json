There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was using her phone during a test, which the author assumed was for looking up answers. The teacher didn't count the classmate's grade after the report.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, the teacher usually has a policy to handle it. The author saw something suspicious and reported it. The key point here is whether the author acted appropriately. \n\nThe author didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher after the test. Reporting to the teacher is the correct procedural step. However, the user might be questioning if it's right to \"snitch\" or if they overstepped. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author didn't have concrete evidence. If they just saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing, that's an assumption. The teacher might not have had the chance to check if the phone was actually being used for cheating. However, the teacher already knew the answer and dismissed the grade. \n\nIn academic integrity, it's important to uphold standards. If the teacher investigated and confirmed cheating, then the report was justified. If the teacher acted without evidence, maybe the author's report was based on a misunderstanding. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: intent (trying to maintain fairness), method (reporting to the teacher instead of confronting the classmate first), and the outcome (teacher took action). \n\nIn many cases, reporting cheating is seen as the right thing to do, even if it's uncomfortable. However, some people might argue that the author should have confronted the classmate first. But the teacher's role is to handle such issues, so going to the teacher is appropriate. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author's report was based on a genuine suspicion and the teacher handled it correctly. If the teacher made a judgment based on the report, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the teacher acted without proper investigation, maybe the author should have done more. However, the scenario states the teacher didn't count her grade, implying she took action. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to maintain academic integrity. The answer should be B.\n"
