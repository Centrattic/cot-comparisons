There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their teacher a classmate cheated on a test. The situation is that they noticed the classmate using a phone during the test, which they believe was to cheat. Afterward, they reported it to the teacher, and the grade wasn't counted. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main points here are about academic integrity. Cheating is generally considered wrong in educational settings because it's unfair to others who studied. The person in question observed what they believed was cheating and took action by informing the teacher. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has clear policies against cheating and encourages reporting it, then the student might be right to act. However, if the student's actions were vindictive or done for personal reasons, that could be a problem. But in the scenario, the student mentions that everyone studied hard, implying they're concerned about fairness. \n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The student went to the teacher after class when others were gone, which seems like a responsible approach. They didn't spread rumors but directly informed the authority. \n\nBut wait, was there confirmation that the classmate actually cheated? The student saw the classmate looking at the phone. But maybe there's a non-cheating explanation. However, the teacher decided not to count the grade, so there might be internal procedures. The student's intention was to uphold academic standards, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student should have approached the situation differently, like asking the teacher during the test. However, if the student didn't want to cause a scene or disturb the test environment, going to the teacher after could be justifiable. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the action was based on a reasonable suspicion and the teacher acted on it, the student might not be at fault. But if the report was a false accusation, then it would be wrong. However, the student didn't have proof, just what they saw. That's a gray area. Schools often take reports seriously even without concrete proof if there's a suspicion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the student's action was to maintain fairness, they reported it appropriately, and the teacher handled it. The answer might be that the student isn't in the wrong.\n"
