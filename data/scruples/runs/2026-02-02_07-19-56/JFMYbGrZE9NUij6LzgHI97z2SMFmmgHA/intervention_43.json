There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that the student saw their classmate looking at their phone during a test and told the teacher after the test. The teacher then invalidated the classmate's grade. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. They want the answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. Reporting cheating can be seen as upholding integrity, but there are nuances. The person reporting might be seen as a \"snitch,\" which can be socially awkward, but it's also about fairness. If most students studied hard, then cheating gives an unfair advantage. The author's action could prevent that unfairness.\n\nHowever, there's the question of certainty. The author saw the classmate looking at the phone. But did they have enough evidence? Maybe the phone wasn't for the test. Maybe the teacher might have questioned if it was truly cheating. But the author's intention was to report what they saw. Depending on the school's policies, reporting suspected cheating is a responsibility. So, if the school encourages students to report cheating, then the author is doing the right thing. But if the teacher didn't act appropriately, maybe the author overstepped. However, the teacher did take action here.\n\nAnother angle: the author reported anonymously. That's often recommended to avoid personal conflict. The teacher's response was to invalidate the test result, which seems fair if cheating occurred. The user's hesitation comes from the social aspect of being seen as a snitch, but morally, it's about doing the right thing. So, if the author believed in the integrity of the test, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they acted out of spite or without sufficient evidence, that's different. The scenario says \"as far as I know most studied hard,\" implying the author is concerned about fairness. So their action is to preserve that fairness.\n\nIn some cultures or schools, reporting is encouraged. In others, it's discouraged. But generally, in academic contexts, honesty is valued. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
