There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to figure this out based on the situation given.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The person saw a classmate using their phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the grade. The person is wondering if they did the right thing. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Reporting cheating is usually considered the right thing to do because it maintains academic integrity. Cheating is unfair to others who studied, so reporting it upholds fairness. However, maybe there's a nuance here. Did the reporter have concrete evidence? The classmate was looking at their phone and writing. If that's against the test rules, then it's cheating. But maybe the reporter was mistaken? The user says \"as far as I know most studied hard,\" implying that the classmate didn't. So the reporter acted on what they saw. \n\nBut could there be a reason the classmate was on their phone? Maybe it's a medical device or an accommodation. But the teacher would know the rules. Also, the reporter went to the teacher after class, which is the correct procedure. They didn't confront the classmate directly. So the action seems responsible. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, maybe because they feel it was a betrayal or the classmate had a valid reason. But without more context, the act of reporting cheating is generally right. The teacher would handle it, and the classmate might face consequences. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They upheld integrity and followed proper channels.\n"
