There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did the right thing. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so reporting it might be seen as the right action. However, sometimes people might think it's snitching and could damage friendships or create a hostile environment. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. The teacher took action, so maybe the author did the right thing by upholding academic integrity. On the other hand, maybe there's a gray area if the evidence wasn't clear, but the user says it was obvious she was cheating. \n\nI should consider the potential consequences. If the classmate actually cheated, the teacher should handle it. The author is protecting the fairness of the test for everyone who studied. So probably, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
