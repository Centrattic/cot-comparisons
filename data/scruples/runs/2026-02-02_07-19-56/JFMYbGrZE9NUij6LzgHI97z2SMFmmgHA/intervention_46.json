There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was using their phone during a test, and the author told the teacher after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm, why? Maybe because they consider it snitching? But cheating is a serious issue. If someone is cheating, isn't it the right thing to report it? But maybe the author's intention matters. They mention that they and others studied hard, so they felt it was unfair. \n\nBut let's think about the rules. If the teacher has a policy against cheating, then reporting is part of upholding those rules. However, maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to the classmate first or giving them a chance to explain. But in a test setting, the teacher is the authority. \n\nAlso, maybe the classmate didn't actually cheat. The author saw them looking at the phone, but maybe it was a different reason. However, the author believed it was cheating. In that case, reporting it is still the responsible action. \n\nSo, the key points: the author acted to prevent unfair advantage, followed the correct procedure by reporting to the teacher, and there's a possibility the classmate did cheat. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
