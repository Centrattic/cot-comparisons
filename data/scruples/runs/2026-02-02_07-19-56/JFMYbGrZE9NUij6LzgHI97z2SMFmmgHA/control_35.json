There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and told them. The teacher then invalidated the test grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, they usually face consequences. The person reporting could be seen as upholding academic integrity, which is a positive thing. However, there's a debate about whether they should have confronted the classmate first or just let it go.\n\nBut the question is about whether the reporter is at fault. The key points are: the reporter observed the cheating, reported it after the test, and the teacher took action. The user is asking if reporting was the right move. \n\nSome might argue that the reporter acted out of jealousy or personal gain, but the scenario mentions that the reporter and others studied hard, implying that the reporter is genuinely concerned about fairness. However, others might say that involving the teacher was unnecessary and that the classmate should have been confronted first.\n\nBut in most educational contexts, teachers encourage students to report cheating. The teacher's job is to maintain integrity, and students are often advised to report such incidents. So the reporter is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
