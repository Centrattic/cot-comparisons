There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author saw a classmate using their phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the classmate's grade. The author is questioning if they did the right thing, and the user initially thinks they are in the wrong.\n\nHmm, cheating is a serious issue. Schools have policies against it to maintain fairness. If someone is caught cheating, it's usually handled by the teacher or administration. But is reporting a classmate considered \"snitching\"? That depends on the context. If the author is genuinely concerned about academic integrity, then reporting might be the right thing. However, if they did it out of spite or personal dislike, that could be different.\n\nIn this case, the author says they and others studied hard, implying they care about the fairness of the test. They observed the cheating and reported it after the test, which is when the teacher was available. The teacher didn't take the grade, so the classmate's work was invalidated because of the cheating. \n\nBut is there a possibility of a mistake? Did the author have concrete evidence, or was it just their observation? If they saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing, that might be considered sufficient evidence for a report. However, if the teacher didn't actually check the phone or confirm the cheating, maybe the report was unfounded. But the teacher still decided to void the grade, so perhaps the teacher believed the report. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the report and the outcome. If the author acted in good faith to uphold academic standards, they might be in the right. But if they reported out of jealousy or to get the classmate in trouble for some other reason, that's different. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but the scenario as described doesn't show malice. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. Cheating undermines the value of the test and others' efforts, so reporting it is a responsible action. The answer should be B.\n"
