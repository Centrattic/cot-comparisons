There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So the scenario is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade. The question is whether the reporter (the \"I\" in the story) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. On the other hand, some might argue that it's meddling or causing trouble for the classmate. But the key points here are that the reporter observed the cheating directly and reported it to the teacher. The teacher then took action, which is the standard procedure.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The reporter claims they studied hard, so maybe they felt it was unfair. But the main issue is whether reporting the cheating is justified. In most educational settings, students are encouraged to report misconduct. So the teacher's response of disqualifying the grade seems appropriate. The reporter didn't confront the classmate directly first, but maybe that's not necessary if the teacher's the authority. Also, the reporter did report it after the fact, which is still responsible.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Did the reporter have enough evidence? They saw the classmate on the phone. Depending on the school's policies, maybe they needed more concrete proof, but in many cases, a witness account is enough. Also, the aftermath\u2014was the classmate given a chance to explain? The story doesn't mention that, but the teacher's action was to not count the grade, which is a standard consequence.\n\nOverall, the act of reporting cheating is usually seen as the right thing to do. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
