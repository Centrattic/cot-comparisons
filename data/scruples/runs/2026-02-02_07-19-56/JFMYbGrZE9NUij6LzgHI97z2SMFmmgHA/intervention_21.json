There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a student who reported a classmate for cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nFirst, the author saw a classmate using their phone during a test. They went to the teacher after class and reported it. The teacher then didn't count the classmate's grade. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nCheating is a serious issue. If someone does cheat, reporting it can be the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. The author did study hard along with others, so the cheating would be unfair. The key points are: did the author have a legitimate reason to report, and was the method appropriate?\n\nThe author didn't confront the classmate first or gather more evidence, but they saw the cheating directly. They reported it to the teacher after the test, which is a standard procedure. The teacher's response was to invalidate the grade, which is a common consequence for cheating. The author's action prevents unfair advantage, so they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have warned the classmate first. But in many schools, reporting cheating is expected. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
