There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was looking at their phone and writing answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the cheater's grade. The question is whether the reporter (AITA) is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered unfair, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. The person did study hard, so they might feel it's unfair if others cheat. On the other hand, maybe there's a question about whether the observer was certain. Did they have conclusive evidence? Sometimes people might misinterpret actions, like looking at a phone could be for other reasons, but in a test setting, it's often suspicious.\n\nAnother angle: the reporter went to the teacher directly after the test. Was that the right procedure? If the teacher had a policy on reporting cheating, maybe they should have done it differently. But in most cases, reporting to an authority is the correct step. Also, the teacher didn't use the grade, which is a standard response to cheating.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The reporter might be a \"snitch,\" but in academic settings, integrity is important. If everyone cheated, the system breaks down. So reporting helps maintain fairness. The classmate's actions were against rules, so the reporter upheld them.\n\nHowever, maybe the reporter should have considered the consequences for the classmate. Cheating can have serious repercussions, like academic penalties. But the classmate made the choice to cheat. The reporter's duty is to maintain standards, even if it means a friend or classmate faces consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The reporter acted to prevent cheating, which is against academic integrity. They reported it through the proper channel. Unless there's a reason to doubt the observation (like not being sure), the reporter is in the right. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
