There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate used their phone to look up answers, and the author told the teacher after the test. The teacher then invalidated the classmate's grade.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The answer should be either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and many schools have policies against it. Reporting cheating is often seen as the right thing to do because it upholds academic integrity. However, there are nuances. The author didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher after the fact. Did they have enough evidence? The author saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing answers, which could be strong evidence. But was it conclusive? Maybe the phone use wasn't for cheating, though in a test setting, that's less likely. \n\nThe teacher's response was to not count the grade, which is typical if cheating is confirmed. The author's justification is that others studied hard, so cheating is unfair. \n\nBut why would the author think they're in the wrong? Maybe because they're seen as \"snitching\" or causing trouble for a peer. However, if the school encourages reporting academic dishonesty, then the author did the right thing. \n\nI should also consider if there's a conflict of interest or if the author had a reason to target the classmate. The question doesn't mention any, so it's likely the author acted out of a sense of fairness. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, reporting wrongdoing, especially when it affects fairness, is encouraged. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, some might argue about the method\u2014should they have told the teacher privately or confronted the classmate first? But in many cases, reporting to the teacher directly is the correct procedure, especially if the teacher has policies in place. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author did the right thing by upholding academic integrity, even if it caused tension. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
