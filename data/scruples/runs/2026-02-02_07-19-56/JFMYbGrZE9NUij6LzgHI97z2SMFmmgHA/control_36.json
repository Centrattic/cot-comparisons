There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So the situation is that during a test, a classmate was caught looking at their phone and writing answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade. Now the question is whether the reporter did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a clear policy against cheating and encourages reporting it, then the person did the right thing. But if the school has a different approach, maybe it's different. But generally, most schools have anti-cheating policies.\n\nThen, there's the intention. The person says most of the class studied hard, so maybe they felt it was unfair. Reporting cheating is usually seen as the right thing to do because it maintains fairness. However, sometimes people worry about being a \"snitch,\" but in academic settings, integrity is usually valued.\n\nAlso, the method: the person went directly to the teacher after the test, which is a proper way to report. They didn't confront the classmate publicly or spread rumors, which is important. The teacher then handled it by not counting the grade, which seems like the appropriate action.\n\nBut could there be any wrongdoing? Maybe if the person had no proof, but in this case, they saw the classmate using the phone. However, sometimes there could be misunderstandings, but the question states it was \"pretty obvious,\" so the observer is confident.\n\nSo overall, the person acted to uphold academic integrity, reported appropriately, and the teacher took action. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance. Some might say it's interfering with others' business, but in a test scenario, cheating is a serious offense. The key is whether the action was justified and followed the right procedure. Since they did, the answer should be B.\n"
