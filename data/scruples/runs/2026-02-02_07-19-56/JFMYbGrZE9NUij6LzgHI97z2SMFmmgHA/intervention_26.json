There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their classmate's cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user says they saw a classmate looking at her phone during a test and writing down answers, which they interpreted as cheating. After the test, they went to the teacher and reported it, leading to the classmate's grade being taken away. The question is whether the author did the right thing by \"snitching.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider the school's policies. In most educational settings, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is usually encouraged. However, the way the report was made might matter. The author went directly to the teacher after class when everyone was gone. That seems responsible because they didn't spread rumors but went to the authority figure. \n\nThen there's the evidence. The user claims they saw the classmate using her phone. But is that enough? If there's no clear proof like screenshots or a teacher witnessing it, maybe the teacher had to rely on the student's word. However, if the teacher dismissed the grade based on the report, maybe the teacher had prior knowledge or other reasons. The user might not know the full context, but their action was based on observation.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The user studied hard, and the classmate might have been trying to gain an unfair advantage. Reporting cheating can maintain fairness in the class. However, there's also the social aspect\u2014snitching can lead to conflicts among peers. But ethically, preventing unfair practices is important.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. If they acted in good faith, believing cheating occurred, they might be justified. However, if they were motivated by personal gain, like wanting a better grade themselves, that's different. The user mentions that most studied hard, implying they were trying to be fair.\n\nThe user's action led to the classmate's grade being taken away. If the teacher didn't count the grade, maybe the teacher believed the report. So the user's action had consequences, but was it wrong? If the user is correct, then they did the right thing. If the classmate didn't cheat, then the user caused harm. But the user based their report on what they saw.\n\nI think the key here is the intention and the process. If the user reported in a responsible way (as they did) and acted in good faith, they might not be in the wrong. Cheating undermines the system, and reporting it is a moral duty for some. However, others might argue that it's better to talk to the classmate first or that the user didn't have solid evidence. But in many schools, reporting suspicious behavior is part of academic integrity policies.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
