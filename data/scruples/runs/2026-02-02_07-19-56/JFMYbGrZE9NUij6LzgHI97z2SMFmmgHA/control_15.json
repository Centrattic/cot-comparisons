There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using a phone to write down answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally considered dishonest and undermines academic integrity. If someone is caught cheating, the usual response is for the teacher to handle it, which might involve penalties like a zero on the test. The reporter's action here is reporting the cheating, which is a form of whistleblowing in an academic context.\n\nNow, is the reporter in the wrong? Well, the teacher is responsible for enforcing academic standards. By reporting the cheating, the reporter is upholding those standards. However, some might argue that the reporter's motivation could be to maintain fair grading, especially since others studied hard. On the flip side, there's the consideration of privacy and the potential for false accusations. But in this case, the reporter saw the classmate using a phone during the test, which is a common sign of cheating. Since phones are typically prohibited during exams, the reporter acted on clear evidence.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The reporter went directly to the teacher after class when others were gone. That seems appropriate because it's confidential and allows the teacher to investigate. There's no mention of spreading rumors or public shaming, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, the key points are: the reporter observed cheating, reported it confidentially, and the teacher took appropriate action. The reporter's action prevents unfair advantage, which is right. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
