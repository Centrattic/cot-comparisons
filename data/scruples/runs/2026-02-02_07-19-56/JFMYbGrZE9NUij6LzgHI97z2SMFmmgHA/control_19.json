There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The person saw their classmate looking at their phone during the test and informed the teacher afterward. The teacher didn't count the cheater's grade.\n\nFirst, the main point is whether the teacher's action was justified. The user noticed cheating, which is against academic integrity. Reporting it could be seen as upholding fairness, especially since others studied hard. But sometimes, there might be misunderstandings. Maybe the classmate wasn't cheating, or the phone use was allowed. But the user thought it was obvious.\n\nHowever, the user approached the teacher after everyone left, which might be a good way to handle it privately. The teacher took action, so the report had an impact. The user is worried about being a \"snitch,\" which is a common concern. But if the act was indeed cheating, then reporting it is responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to address it without snitching, but if the user is certain of the cheating, their action is justified. The answer likely leans towards not being in the wrong because they're maintaining academic honesty. So the answer is B.\n"
