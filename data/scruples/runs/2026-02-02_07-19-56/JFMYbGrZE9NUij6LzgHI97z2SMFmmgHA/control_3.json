There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that the classmate was seen using a phone during a test, and the student told the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so reporting it might be seen as right. But some people might say it's snitching and could harm relationships. But in an academic setting, integrity is important. The student did the right thing by informing the teacher. The teacher's job is to enforce rules, so the student followed proper procedures. The fact that others studied hard adds context that the student feels the cheating is unfair. There's no indication the report was malicious. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
