There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a classmate who cheated. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was looking at her phone, and the author told the teacher after the test. The teacher then invalidated the cheater's grade.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, cheating is a serious issue in academic settings. If the author saw the classmate using a phone during the test and it was against the rules, then reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do. The teacher's response (not counting the grade) supports that the action was justified.\n\nBut why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe if they were motivated by jealousy or if there's no concrete evidence. However, the author stated they observed the classmate looking at the phone and writing answers. If the test rules prohibit phones, then the evidence is there. Also, the teacher acted on it, so the system worked.\n\nAnother angle: did the author act out of malice? The user says the classmate cheated, so the author's intent was to report wrongdoing. In many schools, students are encouraged to report cheating. So the right thing is to report to maintain fairness.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
