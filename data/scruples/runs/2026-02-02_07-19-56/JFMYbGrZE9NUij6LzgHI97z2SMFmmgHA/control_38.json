There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that during a test, the person noticed a classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. They went to the teacher after the test and reported it. The teacher invalidated the test grade. The question is whether the person who reported this is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, the appropriate action is usually to report it so that the institution can handle it according to their policies. However, sometimes people might feel that reporting a peer could be seen as snitching, which might lead to social consequences.\n\nBut in this case, the person observed what they believed to be cheating. They didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher privately. The teacher then took action. The key points here are: was there a violation of academic integrity, and was the reporting done in a proper manner?\n\nCheating undermines the fairness of the academic process. If the person truly saw the classmate using a phone during a test, which is typically prohibited, then reporting it is the right thing to do. The person didn't make a public accusation but went to the teacher directly, which is the correct procedure. However, there's a possibility that the classmate wasn't actually cheating\u2014maybe the phone was for a legitimate reason. But the person acted on their observation, which they believed to be cheating.\n\nIn most academic codes, students are expected to maintain integrity and report dishonesty. So, the act of reporting, when done responsibly, is not considered wrong. The outcome is that the teacher investigated and invalidated the grade, which is standard procedure. Therefore, the person isn't in the wrong for reporting the suspected cheating. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
