There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that someone saw their classmate using a phone during a test and reported it to the teacher, leading to the grade not being counted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings because it's unfair to others and undermines the integrity of assessments. The person reporting did so after the test and when others had left, which might be seen as a private report. The teacher took action, which is standard procedure.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe they believe that it's not their place to report someone, or that they should have confronted the classmate directly first. Alternatively, there could be a cultural or personal belief that gossiping or snitching is negative.\n\nOn the other hand, reporting cheating can be seen as upholding academic standards. If the student genuinely believed cheating was happening, reporting it to the teacher is the appropriate step. The teacher then handles the situation, so the student isn't taking matters into their own hands. The fact that they studied hard might add to their motivation to report, as they feel it's unfair.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the student didn't have concrete evidence, just an observation. But in this case, the student saw the classmate using a phone to get answers, which is a clear sign of cheating. Also, reporting to the teacher after the fact is a standard procedure. If the student didn't report it, the cheater might have gotten an unfair advantage.\n\nSo, the key points are: the act of cheating is wrong, the student reported it through the proper channel (teacher), and the teacher acted accordingly. Therefore, the student isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue about the method or timing, but the action itself is justified. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
