There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that the classmate was seen using their phone during a test, and the author told the teacher, leading to the grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. If the teacher has a policy against cheating and expects students to report it, then the author might be justified. On the other hand, if the author is considered a \"snitch,\" there might be social implications.\n\nThe key points here: the author observed the classmate cheating, reported it to the teacher, and the teacher took action. The author's intention was to uphold academic integrity. However, some might argue that the author is betraying a classmate or causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, maintaining fairness in assessments is important. If the teacher supports reporting cheating, then the author did the right thing. The answer might depend on the school's policies and the teacher's stance. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In most cases, reporting cheating is the correct action, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might say that the author should have confronted the classmate first or considered other factors. But given the information, the action seems justified.\n"
