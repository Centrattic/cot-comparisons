There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was using a phone during a test, which the student found suspicious. After the test, the student told the teacher, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the student did the right thing. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it might be justified. The student observed something questionable and brought it to the teacher's attention. However, did they have enough evidence? The student saw the classmate looking at a phone and writing answers. Depending on the context, maybe the teacher had allowed phones for something else, but generally, during a test, phones aren't allowed. If the student was certain, then reporting it makes sense.\n\nBut there's a possibility of a misunderstanding. What if the classmate was using the phone for a legitimate reason, like a medical alert app or something? The student acted without discussing with the classmate first. However, in most school policies, the onus is on the student to follow rules, and reporting suspected cheating is part of maintaining academic fairness.\n\nThe student's motivation was that others studied hard, so they wanted to act against cheating. That's understandable. However, some might argue that the student should have approached the teacher during the test or discussed it with the classmate first. But in reality, if you see someone cheating during a test, teachers usually ask you to ignore it to prevent distractions. So approaching the teacher after class is probably the correct method.\n\nSo, the student followed the right procedure by reporting to the teacher. The teacher then took action. Therefore, the student isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
