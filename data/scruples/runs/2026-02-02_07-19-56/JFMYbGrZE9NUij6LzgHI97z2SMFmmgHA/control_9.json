There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers, so the narrator told the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the classmate's grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do. The narrator mentions that they and others studied hard, implying that the classmate's actions were unfair. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of privacy and confrontation. The narrator approached the teacher after class when everyone else had left. Was that the appropriate time? Maybe, because it's a private conversation. But maybe the narrator should have done it in a more formal way, like through a written report or during office hours, but that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: the narrator didn't confront the classmate first. Should they have? Sometimes people prefer to address the issue directly before involving a teacher. However, if the cheating is in progress, the best course of action is to report it to an authority rather than handle it alone.\n\nAlso, the narrator's motivation is key. They mention that others studied hard, so their intention was to uphold fairness. If the report is accurate, then the teacher's action of invalidating the grade is justified. But if the report was based on a misunderstanding, then the narrator could be at fault. The situation says the narrator thought it was \"pretty obvious,\" but that's still a judgment call. However, the user is asking if the narrator is in the wrong, assuming the action was taken. \n\nIn academic settings, many institutions encourage reporting cheating to maintain integrity. So the narrator did the right thing by informing the teacher. However, some might argue that it's a \"snitch\" culture and that peer conflict should be handled differently. But in this case, the teacher took appropriate action, so the narrator isn't necessarily at fault.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported a potential violation of academic integrity, which is generally the correct action."
