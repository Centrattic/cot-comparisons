There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that during a test, the author noticed a classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. After the test, they told the teacher, which led to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings because it undermines fairness. If someone cheats, it's unfair to those who studied hard. By reporting the cheating, the author is trying to uphold academic integrity. But there's also the social aspect\u2014tattling can be seen as ratting out a peer, which can create tension or resentment. \n\nHowever, the key points here are that the author observed the cheating firsthand, and they reported it directly to the teacher. The teacher then took appropriate action. In most educational institutions, there are policies in place that encourage students to report academic dishonesty. So from an institutional standpoint, the author acted within the rules. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have approached the classmate first or considered the potential consequences for their friend. But the scenario doesn't mention any prior attempts to address the cheating. Also, approaching the teacher after class when others had left suggests the author wanted to handle it responsibly without causing a scene. \n\nThe user mentioned they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The main factors are intent and action. The intent was to report cheating, which is a violation of academic standards. The action was reporting it through the proper channel. Unless there's evidence of false accusation or malicious intent, the action seems justified. \n\nPossible counterarguments could be about the social dynamics\u2014maybe the classmate was just stressed and didn't mean to cheat, or perhaps the author misinterpreted the situation. But the user's story states that the cheating was obvious, so the author's observation is key here. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a social stigma around reporting peers, from an academic and ethical standpoint, the author did the right thing by upholding integrity. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
