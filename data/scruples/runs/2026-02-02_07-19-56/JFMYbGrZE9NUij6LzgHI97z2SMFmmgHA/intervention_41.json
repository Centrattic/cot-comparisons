There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the author saw their classmate looking at their phone during a test and reported it to the teacher after the fact. The teacher then invalidated the cheater's grade.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. They provided the context of the test being something most students studied hard for, and the classmate's actions were suspicious. The author went to the teacher alone after the test without confronting the classmate first.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, cheating is dishonest and unfair to others who worked hard. Reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. On the other hand, the author didn't confront the classmate directly. Maybe they should have tried to address it during the test, like telling the teacher immediately or informing the classmate to stop. By waiting until after the test, the author might have acted impulsively without ensuring the situation was properly addressed in real-time.\n\nAlso, the method of reporting matters. Approaching the teacher after everyone left might have been more about covering their own actions rather than being transparent. The teacher could have handled it differently if the report was made during the test. Additionally, there's a chance the author misinterpreted the situation\u2014maybe the classmate had a legitimate reason for using their phone. Without evidence, the report could have been based on a mistake.\n\nHowever, the intent was to report cheating, which is a moral duty. The consequences of not reporting might have been unfair to other students. The key factors here are the author's intent and the method of reporting. If the author acted out of a sense of fairness, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But if it was to gain favor with the teacher or out of spite, that's different. The scenario doesn't indicate any ulterior motives, so it's likely the author believed they were doing the right thing.\n\nIn many educational settings, there are protocols for reporting cheating. The author didn't follow the immediate protocol (like informing the teacher during the test), which could be a mistake. But the act of reporting itself is generally seen as right. So, the author's actions are a mix of right (reporting cheating) and wrong (method of reporting). However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Since the consequence was the cheater's grade being invalid, which is fair, but the method might have been flawed. So, the answer might be A or B. But given that the intent was good, maybe B is more appropriate. But if the method is considered wrong, then A. It's a bit tricky.\n"
