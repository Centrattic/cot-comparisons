There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their teacher about a classmate cheating is in the wrong. They provided a situation where a student noticed someone using their phone during a test and reported it. The teacher didn't count the cheater's grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered dishonest, so if someone is doing it, it's against academic integrity. The student reported the cheating, which is a responsible action in many schools. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because they see it as snitching or betrayal.\n\nBut wait, the teacher didn't count the grade, so there's a consequence. The question is about whether the reporter is at fault. In some cases, people might think it's wrong to report a peer, but in others, it's seen as upholding standards. The key factors here are whether the student acted in good faith, if they were certain about the cheating, and if they followed the proper channels.\n\nThe student went to the teacher after class, which is appropriate. They observed the classmate using a phone, which is a common way people cheat. The student didn't confront the classmate first but went straight to the teacher. That might be a point of consideration\u2014maybe the teacher would prefer to address it first with the student. However, the student might have felt uncomfortable confronting the classmate directly.\n\nAnother angle: the student's intention. If they were genuinely concerned about fairness rather than just wanting to feel superior or seeking revenge, then it's more justified. The situation mentions that most students studied hard, implying that cheating undermines their efforts. So the reporter's action could be seen as maintaining fairness.\n\nBut there's also the possibility of mistaken judgment. Was the student sure that the classmate was cheating? If the phone was being used for something else, like a timer or notes unrelated to the test, then the report might be incorrect. However, the user states that the cheater was \"looking at her phone and writing down answers,\" which makes the cheating seem more obvious.\n\nIn some educational settings, it's encouraged to report cheating, while others might frown on it if not handled directly with the accused first. The teacher's response (not counting the grade) suggests that the school has a policy against cheating, so the student's report was effective.\n\nSo, the main debate is between upholding academic integrity versus loyalty to peers. If the school's rules support reporting cheating, then the student isn't in the wrong. But if the culture is more about handling it privately, then maybe the student acted inconsiderately. However, given the information, the student did the right thing by reporting through the proper channel. Therefore, the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
