There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and told them, which resulted in the classmate's grade not being counted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and ethics here. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, it's usually dealt with by the teacher. The question is whether reporting it makes the reporter wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the reporter is upholding academic integrity. They noticed something suspicious and took action to report it. This could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness for everyone else who studied hard. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the reporter is a \"snitch\" or that they overstepped. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like talking to the classmate first or using a different method to report the cheating. Also, there's the possibility that the teacher might have handled it differently if the student had come forward during the test, but in this case, the student reported after the fact.\n\nBut the key points are: the student observed cheating, reported it to the teacher, and the teacher took appropriate action. The consequences for the cheater were applied, which might not necessarily make the reporter wrong. However, some people might feel that the reporter betrayed their classmate's trust or created a hostile environment.\n\nI need to check if there's any policy about reporting cheating. Typically, educational institutions encourage students to report misconduct. So from that perspective, the reporter is following the rules. However, the term \"snitching\" can have a negative connotation in some contexts, implying betrayal or unnecessary tattling. But in an academic setting, reporting cheating is usually the correct action.\n\nAnother angle: the student didn't confront the classmate directly but went straight to the teacher. Some might think the student should have first warned the classmate or given them a chance to stop. But if the student was certain about the cheating, maybe immediate reporting was the right call to prevent others from being affected.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on whether maintaining academic integrity is more important than potential social repercussions. Since the teacher acted on the report and upheld the test's fairness, the reporter likely did the right thing. Therefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
