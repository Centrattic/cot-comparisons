There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that the classmate was using her phone during a test, and the reporter told the teacher, leading the test to be invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If cheating is against the rules, then reporting it might be the right thing to do. But maybe the reporter didn't have enough evidence? Wait, the user says they saw the classmate looking at her phone and writing down answers. That seems like a clear observation. If the test is supposed to be without phones, then that's cheating.\n\nBut some might argue that the reporter is snitching, which is seen as a bad thing socially. However, from an academic integrity standpoint, reporting cheating is usually encouraged. The teacher did invalidate the grade, so maybe the action was correct. The question is whether the reporter is at fault. The answer would likely be no because they're upholding academic standards. So the answer should be B.\n"
