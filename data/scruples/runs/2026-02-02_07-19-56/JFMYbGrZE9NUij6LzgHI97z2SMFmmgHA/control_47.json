There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was using their phone during a test, which the reporter saw. They went to the teacher and reported it, and the teacher invalidated the test score. The user wants to know if the reporter is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others who put in the work. The reporter noticed the cheating and took action, which could be seen as doing the right thing by upholding academic integrity. But there's also the aspect of reporting a classmate, which might be seen as snitching by some.\n\nBut in an academic setting, there's usually an expectation that students will report violations of academic honesty policies. Teachers often encourage students to report cheating because it maintains fairness. So the reporter might be following the rules correctly. However, maybe there were other ways to handle it, like talking to the classmate first. But if the reporter wasn't sure how to approach it, going to the teacher is a standard procedure.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the classmate. If the teacher confirmed the cheating, then the reporter helped prevent an unfair advantage. But if the report was unfounded, maybe the reporter acted without sufficient evidence. However, the scenario says the reporter saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers, which seems like clear evidence. So the reporter had a legitimate reason.\n\nSome people might argue that it's not the student's place to report others, but in many schools, students are taught that reporting misconduct is part of maintaining a fair environment. So the reporter isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
