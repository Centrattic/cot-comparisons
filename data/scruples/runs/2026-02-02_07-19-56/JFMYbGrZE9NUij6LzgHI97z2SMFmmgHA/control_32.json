There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that during a test, the person noticed a classmate using their phone to get answers. After the test, they told the teacher, and the grade was invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating on a test is generally considered dishonest. The person reporting it is following the rules and maintaining academic integrity. However, some might argue that they shouldn't have snitched, maybe to protect their classmate or avoid being a \"snitch.\"\n\nBut the key points here are: the test was important, others studied hard, and the cheating was observed directly. The teacher took action based on the report. The person did the right thing by reporting the cheating. There's no indication of false accusation here. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They upheld academic standards.\n"
