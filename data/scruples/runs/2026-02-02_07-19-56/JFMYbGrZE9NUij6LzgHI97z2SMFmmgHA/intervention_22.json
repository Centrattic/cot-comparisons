There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for reporting a classmate who cheated on a test. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was clearly looking at their phone and writing down answers, which the reporter found suspicious. After the test, they went to the teacher and told them, leading to the teacher not counting the classmate's grade.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my perspective. I need to decide between A (Yes) and B (No). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. However, the person is a classmate, and the reporter might be seen as a \"snitch\" which could have social consequences. \n\nBut the key here is whether the action was wrong. The teacher's responsibility is to maintain fair assessment. If the student saw clear evidence of cheating, then reporting it could be justified. However, the method of reporting might matter. Did they confront the classmate first? Or did they go directly to the teacher? In some cases, people might argue that you should address it with the classmate first, but if the teacher has a policy against sharing grades or handling such issues directly, then going to the teacher is appropriate. \n\nAlso, the impact on the classmate. If cheating was indeed happening, not reporting could allow the cheater to gain an unfair advantage, which is unfair to others who studied hard. The reporter is helping maintain fairness. \n\nBut maybe the reporter was overstepping if there was no clear policy or if they didn't have concrete proof. However, in this case, the reporter saw the classmate looking at their phone and writing, which is pretty direct evidence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the action of reporting a cheater to the teacher, especially with observable evidence, is ethically correct. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
