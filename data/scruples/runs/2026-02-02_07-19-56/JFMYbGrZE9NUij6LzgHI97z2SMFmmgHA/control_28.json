There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person saw a classmate using their phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the cheater's grade. The question is whether the reporter is at fault.\n\nCheating in exams is a serious issue. It's unfair to other students who put in the effort. The reporter here observed something suspicious and took action. But there's a nuance here. Did they have enough evidence? Just seeing someone looking at their phone might not be conclusive. However, in a test setting, phones are usually not allowed, so using one would be a clear violation.\n\nNow, the reporter went to the teacher after the test, which is a responsible step. Reporting cheating is part of maintaining academic integrity. However, the teacher didn't get to see it themselves, so relying on a single student's account could be problematic. But the reporter isn't necessarily wrong for coming forward. It's better to report potential misconduct than to stay silent if you believe it's happening.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the reporter should have considered if there were other factors. Like, maybe the classmate was doing something else on their phone, not necessarily cheating. But given the context of a test, and the fact that the cheater was writing down answers, it's plausible the reporter made a correct judgment.\n\nSo, the key points are: the reporter acted to uphold fairness, used their best judgment based on observation, and reported it through the proper channel. They aren't in the wrong for trying to prevent cheating. Unless there's a policy against reporting anonymously, which isn't mentioned here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
