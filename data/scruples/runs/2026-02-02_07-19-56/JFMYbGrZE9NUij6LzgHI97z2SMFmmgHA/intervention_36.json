There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing down answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and anonymously told them, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is usually considered wrong because it's unfair to other students. If someone is cheating, it undermines the integrity of the academic work. The reporter saw clear evidence\u2014looking at a phone during a test. Phones are typically not allowed in tests, so that's a red flag.\n\nBut then, there's the act of reporting. The reporter did go to the teacher after the fact. The teacher handled it by not counting the grade. Was the reporter right to do that? Some might say that reporting cheating is the right thing to do to maintain fairness. Others might argue that the reporter should have spoken up during the test or maybe confronted the classmate first, but in many cases, students aren't supposed to handle it themselves.\n\nAnother angle: the reporter did go to the teacher directly, which is the proper authority. Anonymity might be an issue, but in some cases, students report anonymously to avoid retaliation. The teacher's decision to invalidate the grade seems appropriate if the evidence is clear.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the reporter acted out of jealousy or personal gain. But the question mentions that the reporter studied hard, implying that the classmate's cheating was unfair to them. There's no indication of personal vendetta here.\n\nSo, considering the intent to maintain fairness and the proper reporting to an authority, the reporter might not be in the wrong. Cheating is against academic integrity policies, and reporting it aligns with those policies. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the reporter saw the classmate using a phone, but maybe the teacher had allowed phones for some reason. However, that's not mentioned here. The key point is that the reporter observed cheating and reported it through the correct channel. So, B makes sense.\n"
