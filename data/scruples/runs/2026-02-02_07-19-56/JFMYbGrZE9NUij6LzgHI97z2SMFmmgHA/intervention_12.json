There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to look up answers. The person reported this to the teacher after the test, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a serious academic offense, and reporting it is generally seen as the right thing to do to maintain fairness. However, there might be nuances. Did the person have enough evidence? They saw the classmate using their phone and writing answers. If the teacher's policy is to report cheating, then the person acted appropriately. But maybe there's a way the person could have handled it differently, like confronting the classmate first or the teacher during the test. However, in many cases, students aren't supposed to interrupt a test, so reporting after might be the only option.\n\nAlso, the user's motivation is important. They mention that others studied hard, implying they wanted fairness. The action of reporting prevents unfair advantage, which is a positive outcome. But the user questions if they were a snitch. The term \"snitch\" often has negative connotations, but in this context, it's about upholding academic integrity. The key here is whether the action was justified. If the person had a valid reason and followed the correct procedure (reporting to the teacher), then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the classmate wasn't actually cheating\u2014maybe they were using the phone for something else. But the person observed them looking up answers and writing, which is strong evidence. Also, the teacher's decision to invalidate the grade suggests that the report was taken seriously and the action was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the person reported cheating after observing clear evidence and followed the proper channel. Therefore, they are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
