There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the student noticed a classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. After the test, they told the teacher, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated. The user originally thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is a violation of academic integrity, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. However, there's also the aspect of personal relationships and whether the student should have handled it differently first.\n\nBut the key here is whether the student had a valid reason to believe cheating was occurring. The student saw their classmate using a phone during a test where phones weren't allowed, which is a common rule. If the teacher had explicitly stated no phones, then using a phone is clear cheating. The student approached the teacher after the test, which might be appropriate because they didn't confront the classmate directly, which could have been confrontational or led to arguments.\n\nHowever, maybe the student could have first tried to address the classmate directly or check if there was a misunderstanding. But in many school policies, reporting suspected cheating to an authority is encouraged to maintain fairness. The student's action prevented an unfair advantage, which benefits the integrity of the assessment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the student was motivated by personal dislike or jealousy, that's different. But the scenario mentions that most students studied hard, so the student's action was to uphold fairness rather than personal gain. \n\nSo, considering academic integrity policies and the need to report violations, the student is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
