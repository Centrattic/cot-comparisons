There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told the teacher about a classmate cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that the classmate was seen looking at her phone during the test, and the person reported it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in an academic setting. Reporting it is usually seen as upholding academic integrity. The person did study hard, so they might feel that the cheater is getting an unfair advantage. By reporting, they're trying to maintain fairness.\n\nBut there are other angles. Did the reporter have concrete evidence? They saw the classmate looking at a phone. Depending on the rules, just seeing someone on a phone might not be enough. However, if the teacher already has policies against using phones during tests, then it's valid. Also, did the reporter do it anonymously or in a respectful way? The user went to the teacher after class when others were gone, which seems appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the reporter is a \"snitch\" and that it's better to handle it privately. But academic dishonesty is a serious matter, and institutions usually encourage reporting it. The teacher's decision to not count the grade was the right action, so the report had the intended effect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person wasn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent cheating, which is against the rules. The answer should be B for No.\n"
