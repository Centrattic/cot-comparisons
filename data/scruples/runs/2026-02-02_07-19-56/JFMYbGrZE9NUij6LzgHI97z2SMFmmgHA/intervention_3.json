There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that the student saw the classmate using their phone during a test and told the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the test grade. The user originally thinks the reporter is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating undermines academic integrity, so reporting it might be seen as doing the right thing. But there's also the aspect of trust and privacy. The student didn't confront the classmate first; they went straight to the teacher. Maybe the teacher had already given instructions about using phones, so using a phone is a clear violation. The reporter didn't give the classmate a chance to explain, which could be a problem if there was a legitimate reason (like looking up something for the test, though that's unlikely). \n\nHowever, if the test rules prohibit phone usage, then using a phone is a clear violation. The reporter might be protecting the integrity of the test for others. But some might argue that the reporter should have talked to the classmate first or there's an assumption that students know the rules. The key factors here are whether the rules were clear and if the reporter acted in good faith. Since the teacher didn't use the grade, it shows the report had consequences. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the student overstepped by not giving the classmate a chance to explain. But if the act was obvious cheating, like looking up answers, then it's a violation. So the answer might hinge on whether the reporter acted appropriately. Since the test environment typically has strict rules, the reporter's action is justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
