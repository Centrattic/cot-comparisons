There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers. The author told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cheating is usually considered wrong in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, reporting it might be seen as upholding integrity. But there's also the social aspect\u2014some might view it as snitching. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author had a valid reason to report. The classmate was using a phone during the test, which is typically prohibited. The author didn't confront the classmate directly but told the teacher after the fact. Did they act appropriately? \n\nIn many educational institutions, cheating is a serious offense, and reporting it is expected. However, the method of reporting might affect the perception. Reporting anonymously after the fact could be seen as less confrontational but might also be seen as undermining a peer without giving them a chance to explain. But in this case, the teacher handled it by not counting the grade, so maybe the process was followed correctly.\n\nAnother angle is the motive. The author mentions that they and others studied hard, implying they felt it was unfair. Reporting cheating can be seen as standing up for fairness. However, some might argue that it's a personal choice how to handle such situations, and snitching could damage relationships.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The reported student might lose trust or face academic penalties, which is a big deal. But if cheating isn't addressed, it could set a bad precedent. The author's action might be justified in maintaining academic standards.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they had a legitimate reason to believe cheating occurred and reported it through the proper channel (the teacher), then they might be in the right. However, if their suspicion was unfounded, it could be problematic. The description says \"it was pretty obvious,\" suggesting the author was certain. So the report was based on observed actions, which adds credibility.\n\nIn summary, the action was to report cheating, which is generally considered the right thing to do. However, some might still see it as snitching. The answer depends on whether the action aligns with institutional policies and if the author acted responsibly. Given that the teacher took appropriate action, the author is likely in the right. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
