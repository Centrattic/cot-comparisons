There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The student saw their classmate using a phone during a test and reported it. The teacher then invalidated the test grade for that classmate. The student is asking if they did the wrong thing by snitching.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is against academic integrity. If someone is cheating, it's unfair to others who studied. The reporter might feel it's right to report to maintain fairness. Teachers usually encourage reporting misconduct, so the student followed the correct procedure by going to the teacher directly after the test.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the student didn't have concrete proof. They saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing, but maybe the phone use was for something else. However, during a test, using a phone is typically against rules, so the student might have a valid reason to assume cheating.\n\nAlso, the student reported it in a responsible way\u2014after the test, in private, to the teacher. There's no evidence of malice or personal vendetta here. The student's motivation was to uphold the integrity of the test, which others worked hard for.\n\nBut some might argue that the student could have confronted the classmate first or tried to warn them during the test instead of just reporting. However, during a test, it's usually not allowed to talk or interact, so that might not be feasible.\n\nIn most academic settings, reporting cheating is encouraged. The teacher's decision to not count the grade suggests they took the report seriously and followed protocol. The student acted within the expected guidelines to prevent unfair advantage.\n\nSo considering all that, the student isn't in the wrong. They did the right thing by reporting the cheating.\n"
