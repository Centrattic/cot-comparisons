There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for reporting a classmate's cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author saw a classmate using their phone during a test, which is typically against the rules. After the test, the author reported this to the teacher, leading to the grade being invalidated. The question is whether the author did the right thing or if they're in the wrong.\n\nCheating is a serious issue in academic settings. Most schools have policies against it to maintain fairness. If the teacher didn't allow phones during the test, then using one would be cheating. The author's action was to report the cheating, which could be seen as upholding academic integrity.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the author handled it. They went to the teacher alone after everyone left, which might have been a good move to provide evidence without confrontation. However, sometimes people feel that reporting a peer can lead to social backlash, which the author might face. \n\nThe key points to consider are: \n1. Did the classmate actually cheat? The author claims they saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing answers. If the school's rules prohibit phones during tests, this is likely cheating.\n2. Was the author's method of reporting appropriate? Reporting to the teacher directly seems reasonable. \n3. Are there any mitigating factors? Maybe the author acted out of jealousy or personal issues, but the post doesn't mention that. It says the author studied hard, implying they wanted fair evaluation.\n\nCheating undermines the value of education for everyone. Reporting it is often encouraged by institutions. However, some might argue that the author should have discussed it with the classmate first, but in a test setting, that's not practical. The immediate action after the test to inform the teacher is logical.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author misunderstood the situation, but they had a clear observation. If the teacher confirmed the cheating, then the report was valid. If not, maybe the author was wrong, but the scenario states the grade was invalidated, suggesting the teacher agreed.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author acted within their responsibility to report cheating, which is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
