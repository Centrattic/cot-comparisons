There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about reporting a classmate for cheating on a test. The user (the author) saw their classmate looking at their phone during the test and then told the teacher after the test. The teacher didn't count the classmate's grade. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of reporting someone for cheating. Cheating is against academic integrity, so reporting it could be seen as the right thing to do. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and the potential for false accusations. The author saw the classmate using their phone and assumed they were cheating. But did they have enough evidence? Maybe the phone was for something else, but the author made a judgment based on what they saw. \n\nThen there's the method of reporting. The author went directly to the teacher after class, when everyone was gone. That seems responsible because they didn't make a scene or spread rumors. The teacher then took action, which in this case was not counting the grade. \n\nBut is there a possibility that the author acted out of jealousy or some other motive? The post mentions that they and others studied hard, so maybe the author felt it was unfair if someone didn't play by the rules. However, the author's intention was to report cheating, not to get back at the classmate. \n\nIn academic settings, teachers usually encourage students to report cheating if they have evidence. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable suspicion. Since they observed the classmate looking at the phone during the test, that's a valid observation. Even if they didn't have concrete proof, the teacher could investigate further. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is in the wrong, it might be because they didn't confirm the cheating first or if they acted impulsively. But given that using a phone during a test is typically against the rules, the author's action was in line with school policies. \n\nSo, considering the intent to uphold academic integrity and the method of reporting directly to the teacher, the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
