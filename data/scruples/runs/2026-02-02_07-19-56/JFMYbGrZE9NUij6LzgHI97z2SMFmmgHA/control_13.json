There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The student saw a classmate using their phone during a test and reported it. The teacher didn't count the cheater's grade. The student is asking if they're at fault for snitching.\n\nCheating is generally considered unethical, so reporting it might be seen as the right thing to do. But there's also the social aspect\u2014some people might view it as tattling or being a snitch. The key points here are whether the student acted correctly by reporting the cheating.\n\nThe student's motivation is important. They mention that everyone studied hard, implying they wanted fair grading. The action taken was to inform the teacher immediately after the test, which is a responsible approach. The teacher's response was to invalidate the cheater's test, which seems fair. So from an ethical standpoint, the student upheld academic integrity.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the student should have approached the classmate first or that there's a stigma around reporting peers. But since the student didn't confront the classmate directly and went straight to the teacher, it's a more formal and appropriate method. There's no indication of personal vendetta here, just a concern for fairness.\n\nIn most ethical frameworks, preventing cheating is a positive action when done correctly. The teacher handled it, so the student isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful about cultural or situational nuances. If the school had a specific process for reporting, maybe the student should have followed that. But the scenario doesn't mention any such issues. So, sticking with B.\n"
