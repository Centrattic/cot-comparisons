There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone and writing answers, so the reporter told the teacher after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade. The user initially thought the author is wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others and undermines the integrity of the academic system. Reporting cheating can be seen as upholding standards, but there might be nuances. Did the reporter have enough evidence? They observed the classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. If the teacher's policy is against using phones during tests, then this is a clear violation. The reporter acted after the test, which might be appropriate because confronting the classmate during the test could be disruptive. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the reporter should have addressed it during the test, like informing the teacher then and there. But the scenario says the reporter went to the teacher after everyone was gone, which might be seen as trying to avoid confrontation or maybe to ensure the teacher's attention. The key points are whether the report was truthful and done in good faith. If the classmate was indeed cheating, then the reporter did the right thing. But if the report was a false accusation, then the reporter is wrong. The scenario states \"as far as I know most of us including me studied really hard,\" so the reporter's intention might be to maintain fairness.\n\nAnother angle: the impact on the classmate. Reporting cheating can have serious consequences, so the reporter should be sure. But in this case, the evidence seems observable. The phone use during a test is a common cheating method. The teacher's action of not counting the grade suggests that the report was taken seriously. \n\nSo, considering these points, the reporter acted to prevent an unfair advantage, which is ethical. Unless there's a reason to doubt the reporter's intent, like a personal vendetta, but the scenario doesn't mention that. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). But wait, the initial thought was A. Maybe I need to check again. Sometimes people think that reporting others is tattling, but it's actually upholding rules. So the correct answer is B.\n"
