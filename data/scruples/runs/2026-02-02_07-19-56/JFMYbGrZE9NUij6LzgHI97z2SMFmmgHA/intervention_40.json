There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a classmate who cheated. The situation is that the author saw the classmate using a phone during a test and reported it to the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the cheater's grade.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my opinion. I need to determine if the author did the right thing by reporting the cheating. \n\nFirst, cheating is a serious academic integrity issue. If the author witnessed the cheating, reporting it is part of maintaining fairness. The teacher's action of not counting the grade seems appropriate. The author studied hard, so they have a stake in ensuring the test is fair. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't have concrete evidence? Wait, the author says they \"saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers.\" That's observable behavior. If the test rules prohibit phones, then the author has valid reason to report. However, if the teacher didn't mention phone policy before, maybe there's ambiguity. But the key point is the act of using a phone during a test is typically cheating. \n\nIs there a possibility of misunderstanding? Like maybe the phone was for a permitted purpose? The author didn't specify, but the classmate's action of writing down answers from the phone supports cheating. \n\nAlso, the author reported it after the test, when others were gone, which is a responsible way to bring it up. The teacher handled it by not counting the grade. The author's intent was to uphold fairness, which is commendable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They did the right thing by reporting observed cheating. The answer should be B (No).\n"
