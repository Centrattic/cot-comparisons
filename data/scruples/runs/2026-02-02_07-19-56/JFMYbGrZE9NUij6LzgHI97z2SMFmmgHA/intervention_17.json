There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen looking at their phone, which the reporter interpreted as cheating. The reporter then told the teacher, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Reporting cheating is generally seen as a responsible action because it upholds academic integrity. However, there might be nuances. Did the reporter have enough evidence? The user mentions \"saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers,\" which seems like direct observation. If the teacher allows phones for specific reasons, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But assuming the test rules prohibit phones, then it's a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle is motive. The user mentions that most studied hard, implying a sense of fairness. The reporter might feel it's unjust if someone gains an unfair advantage. But was the reporter's action a snitching move, or a responsible report? The term \"snitching\" often has a negative connotation, suggesting personal motives like rivalry. However, the context here seems more about upholding rules.\n\nPotential consequences: The classmate's grade was invalidated. If the teacher didn't count the grade, the classmate might lose credit for the test. But if the teacher investigates further, maybe there's a different outcome. However, the reporter's action led to a decision, which could be seen as fair.\n\nPossible wrongdoings: Did the reporter act impulsively without confirming? For example, maybe the classmate was using the phone for something allowed. But the description says it's \"pretty obvious,\" which suggests the reporter was confident. Also, reporting after the test, when the teacher is alone, shows they wanted to handle it discreetly, which is responsible.\n\nEthically, in many academic settings, reporting cheating is encouraged to maintain fairness. However, some might argue that the reporter could have approached the classmate first or confirmed with the teacher during the test. But in this case, the reporter waited until after the test to inform the teacher, which is a standard procedure.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the reporter's action seems justified. They observed something that violated test rules and reported it through the proper channel. Therefore, the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
