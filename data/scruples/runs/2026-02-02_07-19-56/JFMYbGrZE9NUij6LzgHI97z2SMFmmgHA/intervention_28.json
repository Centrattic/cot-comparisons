There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The story says that the author saw the classmate using their phone during a test and went to the teacher after everyone left. The teacher didn't count the classmate's grade. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Cheating is a serious issue, and if someone is caught, they usually face consequences. The author observed what they believed was cheating, so they reported it. But maybe the classmate wasn't cheating, or maybe the author's method of reporting was wrong.\n\nIn many educational settings, it's encouraged to report academic dishonesty because it's unfair to others who studied. Since the author mentioned that everyone studied hard, it's about fairness. However, some might argue that the author should have waited for the teacher to notice or talk to the classmate first. But in most cases, reporting cheating is the right thing to do. The author didn't confront the classmate in front of others, just reported the incident to the teacher. That seems responsible. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
