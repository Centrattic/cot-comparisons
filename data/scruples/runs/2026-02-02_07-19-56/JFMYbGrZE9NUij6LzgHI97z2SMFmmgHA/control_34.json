There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was using her phone during a test, and the reporter told the teacher after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade. The user wants to know if the reporter is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing. However, sometimes people might feel it's a betrayal, especially if the person is a classmate. But in academic settings, integrity is important, so reporting cheating is usually encouraged.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The person went to the teacher after the test, when everyone had left. That seems appropriate because they didn't make a scene or spread rumors. They directly informed the teacher, which is the proper authority. \n\nBut maybe there's a question of certainty. Did the reporter have enough evidence? They saw the classmate looking at her phone and writing. If they're sure it was cheating, then it's valid. But if it was a misunderstanding, maybe they were wrong. However, the user states it was \"pretty obvious,\" so they probably had a good reason.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the classmate's grade was invalidated. That's a significant outcome, so the reporter should be confident. However, if the teacher already knew or had policies in place, maybe. But in this case, the teacher acted based on the report.\n\nIn academic honor codes, students are often expected to report cheating. So the action aligns with that. The reporter might feel guilty for snitching, but protecting academic integrity is important. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the person isn't in the wrong because they reported a violation of academic standards through the correct channel. Answer B.\n"
