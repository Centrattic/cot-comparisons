There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that someone saw the classmate using their phone during a test, so they told the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the test grade.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. They need an answer of A or B. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered unethical in academic settings. If someone is caught cheating, they usually face consequences. The key points here are: Did the person have a valid reason to report? Was there a clear observation? Did they act appropriately?\n\nThe person observed the classmate using their phone during the test. If the test rules prohibit phone use, then the classmate was violating the rules. Reporting that to the teacher is a responsible action. The teacher's response was to not count the grade, which is a standard consequence. \n\nBut what about the person's intent? They might feel like they're being a \"snitch,\" but in academic integrity, reporting cheating is often encouraged. However, there's a possibility that the person reporting might have acted out of jealousy or other motives. The scenario doesn't mention that, though. The user says that most people studied hard, implying they wanted fairness.\n\nOn the other hand, did they have conclusive evidence? If the teacher didn't see it, maybe the person should have approached the teacher during the test. But if the teacher is already aware of what's happening, then maybe the student did the right thing. Also, after the test, the student reported it privately when others were gone, which is probably the right approach to avoid public shaming.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was truthful and based on observation, and done anonymously and respectfully, then no. Cheating undermines fairness, and reporting it upholds academic integrity. The author might feel bad about being a \"snitch,\" but the action was ethical in maintaining fairness. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
