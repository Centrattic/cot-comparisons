There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The person reported this to the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide if the author did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered wrong. If someone is caught cheating, the usual response is for the teacher to take action. The author saw clear evidence\u2014using a phone during a test. In many schools, using a phone during a test is a form of cheating, so reporting that makes sense.\n\nBut maybe there are factors to consider. Like, was the phone use actually cheating? Maybe the person was just looking up something unrelated. But the author claims it was obvious she was getting answers. Also, after the test, the teacher invalidated her grade, which suggests the action was justified.\n\nHowever, the act of reporting could be seen as snitching, which some people frown upon. But in an academic setting, preventing cheating is important for fairness. If others studied hard, allowing cheating would be unfair to them. The author's action might be seen as maintaining integrity.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have approached the teacher during the test instead of after. Also, if there's uncertainty, maybe confronting the classmate first would be better. But in this case, the author saw clear evidence, so reporting it makes sense.\n\nSo, considering fairness and academic integrity, the author did the right thing. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
