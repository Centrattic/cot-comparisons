There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was seen on their phone, and the author told the teacher after the test. The teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others who put in the effort. If the author saw clear evidence, like the classmate looking at their phone during the test, then reporting that seems like the right thing to do. But maybe there's more to it. Did the author have enough proof? Was the phone in a suspicious way, like not allowed during the test? If the teacher didn't question the student, maybe there's a lack of follow-up. Also, the author might be seen as a snitch, but in some contexts, reporting cheating is expected to maintain academic integrity. However, if the classmate was actually cheating, then the author did the right thing. On the other hand, if the author misinterpreted the situation, like the phone was for a legitimate reason, then the report could be a mistake. But according to the information given, the author saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing answers, which is pretty concrete. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
