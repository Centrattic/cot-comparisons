There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a student who reported a classmate for cheating. The key points are: the student saw the classmate using their phone during a test, went to the teacher after class to report it, and the teacher invalidated the test grade. The question is whether the reporter is in the wrong for snitching.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the class. If cheating is against the policy and the teacher enforces it by invalidating the test, then reporting it seems like the right thing to do. The student might be protecting academic integrity by preventing an unfair advantage. On the other hand, some might argue that the student should handle it differently, like talking to the classmate first or not involving the teacher. But in most school settings, reporting cheating is encouraged to maintain fairness. Also, the student didn't confront the classmate directly but went to the teacher, which is the proper authority. \n\nAnother angle is the potential fallout for the reported student. If the teacher invalidated the test, maybe the student lost points they worked for. But the reporter also studied hard and might feel it's unfair if others cheat. The moral dilemma here is about honesty vs. loyalty to peers. However, academic institutions typically prioritize honesty. Unless there were no clear policies against using phones, the action seems justified. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted within the expected guidelines to uphold test integrity.\n"
