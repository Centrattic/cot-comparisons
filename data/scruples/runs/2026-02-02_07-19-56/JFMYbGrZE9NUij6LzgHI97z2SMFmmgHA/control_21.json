There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to look up answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others who put in honest work. The person reporting might be seen as doing the right thing by upholding academic integrity. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and whether the teacher should have been informed directly after the test without confronting the classmate first.\n\nBut in many educational settings, teachers have policies in place for reporting cheating. If the teacher has a system where students can report incidents, then the student did the right thing. However, if the student acted out of spite or had a personal vendetta, that could be a different story. But in this case, the student mentions that others studied hard, implying they were concerned about fairness.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The student went to the teacher alone after everyone else left, which might be appropriate if that's the protocol. If the teacher has a specific process, maybe the student should have followed that. But the teacher still took action, so maybe the method wasn't the issue.\n\nPotential downsides: The student might have made an accusation without concrete evidence. If the teacher didn't have proof, the student's report could be seen as a false accusation. However, the student saw the classmate using the phone, which is a common form of cheating. If the school allows phones to be used during tests under supervision, then maybe it's different. But usually, tests don't allow phones, so using one would be a clear violation.\n\nAlso, the student's intention matters. If they were trying to maintain fairness rather than personal gain, it's more justified. The fact that they reported it anonymously (waiting until others left) might be to avoid confrontation, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the student should have confronted the classmate directly or given them a chance to explain before reporting. But in a test setting, interrupting to confront someone could cause a scene or be disruptive. Plus, if the teacher's instructions were clear about cheating procedures, following them is the proper course.\n\nIn conclusion, the student acted in accordance with academic integrity by reporting the cheating. Unless there's evidence the student was lying or had a malicious intent, the action is justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
