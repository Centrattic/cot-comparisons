There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using her phone to write down answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the classmate's grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the school. If the school has a clear policy against cheating and encourages students to report it, then the person isn't in the wrong. On the other hand, if the student didn't have solid evidence or if the teacher didn't want reports done anonymously, maybe there's an issue.\n\nThe user mentions that they saw the classmate looking at her phone and writing answers. That seems like direct observation, so it's not just a suspicion. The teacher didn't take any action beyond not counting the grade, which might be standard procedure upon investigation.\n\nCheating undermines the fairness of the test. If others studied hard, cheating gives an unfair advantage. Reporting it could be seen as upholding academic integrity. However, some might argue that the student should have approached the teacher during the test or that it's a personal choice to snitch, but in an educational setting, preventing cheating is usually encouraged.\n\nThe key points here are the school's policies, the presence of evidence, and the intent of the reporter. Since the user reported based on observation and the teacher acted accordingly, it's likely the right thing to do. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
