There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who told their teacher a classmate cheated is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person saw their classmate using their phone during a test and reported it, leading the teacher to not count the cheater's grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it's unfair to others who studied. The person reporting it did so after the test when everyone else was gone, which is a responsible approach. They didn't spread rumors or confront the classmate publicly, which might have been more problematic.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of intent. The reporter wanted to uphold fairness, which is a positive motive. They mentioned that they and others studied hard, implying a sense of justice. However, they might be worried about being seen as a \"snitch,\" which can sometimes carry a negative connotation in school settings. But in academic contexts, reporting cheating is usually encouraged to maintain integrity.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The person went directly to the teacher without confrontation, which is the right procedure. If they had accused the classmate publicly without evidence, that might be different. But here, the report was made to an authority figure, which is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the teacher didn't just punish the cheater; they didn't count the grade, which is a standard consequence. The reporter isn't facing any negative consequences here, but the main question is about their moral standing.\n\nSome might argue that the reporter could have handled it differently, like talking to the classmate first. But in many cases, especially in exams, teachers prefer direct reports to them. The reporter didn't know if the classmate was cheating for sure, but observed something suspicious. The teacher would then investigate if needed.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the person isn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent unfair advantage, used the correct reporting method, and had a valid reason. The answer should be B.\n"
