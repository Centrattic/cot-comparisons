There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The scenario is that during a test, the student saw their classmate looking at their phone and writing answers. Then they told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the cheater's grade. The user thinks the reporter is wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Reporting cheating is a tricky situation. On one hand, cheating is unfair to others who studied hard. The teacher's role is to enforce academic integrity, so reporting it might be the right thing to do. But there's also the aspect of privacy and potentially ruining someone's reputation based on a single observation. What if the classmate had a legitimate reason for using their phone? Maybe they had a medical issue or needed something else. The reporter didn't confront the classmate first, which could have been a way to address it more privately. However, waiting until after the test to tell the teacher is a common procedure, especially if the teacher isn't present during the test to intervene.\n\nAnother angle is the school's policy. If the school encourages students to report cheating, then the reporter might be following the rules. But if the policy is more about handling it through other means first, like confronting the person, then maybe the reporter skipped a step. Also, the aftermath: the cheater's grade was nullified, which is a significant consequence. The reporter might not have considered the impact on their classmate, like academic penalties or social repercussions. However, the teacher handled it by not counting the grade, which is a standard response.\n\nSo, is the reporter in the wrong? If they observed cheating and reported it to the appropriate authority (the teacher), that's generally expected. However, if the observation was a misunderstanding, then there's a problem. But the user says it was \"pretty obvious,\" so maybe they were certain. The key here is whether the reporter acted responsibly. They didn't confront the classmate first, which could have been an option, but in some cases, direct confrontation isn't safe or advisable. The teacher's response was to invalidate the grade, which is a fair outcome if cheating occurred. So, if cheating actually happened, reporting it is correct. If not, then the reporter made a mistake. But since the user is asking if the reporter is in the wrong, and assuming the observation was accurate, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). If the observation was a mistake, then A. But the user says they think the author is wrong, so maybe they're considering that the reporter shouldn't have snitched. However, from a moral standpoint, upholding academic integrity is important, so the answer might be B.\n"
