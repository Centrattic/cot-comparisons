There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and told them, leading to the grade being disregarded.\n\nHmm, the first thing to consider is whether cheating is wrong. Cheating is a clear violation of academic integrity, so the classmate did something wrong. The question is whether the reporter did the right thing by informing the teacher.\n\nThe user is asking if the reporter is in the wrong. The teacher's action was to not count the grade, which is a standard consequence for cheating. The reporter probably felt it was unfair since everyone else studied hard. But some might argue that tattling could create a bad environment or that the teacher should handle it.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, reporting cheating is usually encouraged to maintain fairness. The reporter didn't confront the classmate directly, which might have been an option, but in a test setting, the immediate action is to inform the teacher. The teacher has the authority to address it, so the reporter acted within their responsibility to uphold academic standards. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust in the classroom. If students don't report cheating, it could lead to an unfair advantage for cheaters. The reporter might have felt that by not reporting, they'd be complicit. So the action was justified to maintain fairness, even if it caused some tension with the classmate.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they did the right thing by upholding academic integrity.\n"
