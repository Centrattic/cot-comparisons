There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to look up answers. The author told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade.\n\nSo first, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is usually considered wrong because it's unfair to others who worked hard. Reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. But there's also the social aspect of \"snitching\" and how that's sometimes looked down upon.\n\nThe author's actions might be justified if they genuinely believed cheating was happening. But maybe they should have approached the teacher during the test instead of after, which could have been more appropriate. However, the teacher already invalidated the grade, so the action was taken.\n\nAnother angle: was there enough evidence? The author saw the classmate looking at the phone. Depending on school policy, maybe the teacher needed a report. But the user didn't mention if the teacher was skeptical. Also, the motivation: the author mentions that others studied hard, implying they were trying to uphold fairness.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe they were motivated by personal rivalry or didn't have concrete proof. But the scenario says it was obvious, so the evidence might be sufficient.\n\nIn academic integrity policies, reporting cheating is often encouraged. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
