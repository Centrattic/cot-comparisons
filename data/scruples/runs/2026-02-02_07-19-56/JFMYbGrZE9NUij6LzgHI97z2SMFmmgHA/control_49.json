There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a student saw their classmate cheating during a test and reported it to the teacher. The teacher then invalidated the cheater's grade. The student is asking if they're an a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the class. If cheating is prohibited and there's a policy against it, then reporting it would be following the rules. The student did the right thing by going to the teacher after the test. They didn't confront the classmate directly, which could have caused a scene or conflict, so that's probably why they told the teacher privately.\n\nBut wait, maybe the student was overreacting? Like, maybe the classmate was just checking the time or texting someone for a valid reason. But the student observed the classmate looking at the phone and writing answers, which is a clear sign of cheating. If that's the case, then the student acted appropriately.\n\nAnother angle: the student studied hard and felt it was unfair. Reporting the cheater could be seen as standing up for fairness. However, some might argue that snitching is bad because it creates a hostile environment. But in an academic setting, cheating is usually considered a serious issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nAlso, the student didn't spread rumors or accuse anyone publicly. They went directly to the teacher, which is the right procedure. So the action was responsible. The teacher's response was to disqualify the grade, which is standard. \n\nSo, considering all this, the student isn't in the wrong. They did what they should to uphold academic integrity. So the answer should be B.\n"
