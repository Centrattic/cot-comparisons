There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was looking at their phone and writing answers, and the reporter told the teacher after the test. The teacher then didn't count the cheater's grade.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered wrong, and reporting it can be seen as doing the right thing. But there's also the aspect of privacy and maybe the method of reporting. The person went to the teacher alone after everyone was gone, which might be appropriate. \n\nBut wait, did the reporter have enough evidence? They saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing, but maybe they didn't witness the actual act of looking up answers. However, the reporter thought it was obvious. The teacher decided to invalidate the grade, which might have been based on the report. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the reporter should have talked to the teacher during the test or not said anything to avoid confrontation. But in some cases, people aren't comfortable speaking up during the test. Also, the reporter might be protecting the integrity of the test for everyone who studied hard. \n\nSo, considering all that, the reporter is probably in the right. The act of cheating undermines the fairness of the test, and reporting it is a responsible action. The teacher's response was to not count the grade, which is a standard consequence. There's no indication of malicious intent from the reporter. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
