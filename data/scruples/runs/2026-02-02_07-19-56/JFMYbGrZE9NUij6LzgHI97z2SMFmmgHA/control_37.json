There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that during a test, the classmate was seen using their phone to get answers. The reporter told the teacher after the test, and the teacher invalidated the grade. The user wants to know if the reporter is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. Reporting it could be seen as doing the right thing to maintain fairness. However, sometimes people might feel it's tattling, especially if they don't know the full story.\n\nBut in this case, the reporter saw the classmate using a phone during the test. If the test rules prohibit phones, then it's a clear violation. The reporter didn't confront the classmate in front of others, which could have been embarrassing, but instead went to the teacher privately. That seems responsible.\n\nThe teacher's action was to not count the grade, which is a standard consequence. The reporter's intent was to uphold academic integrity. So, from an ethical standpoint, the reporter is probably in the right. However, some might argue that the reporter overstepped, but given the circumstances, it seems justified.\n\nAnother angle: Did the reporter have enough evidence? They saw the classmate on the phone. Maybe the teacher needed more proof, but the teacher still acted on it. If the teacher didn't act, maybe there's a problem, but since they did, the reporter isn't at fault.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
