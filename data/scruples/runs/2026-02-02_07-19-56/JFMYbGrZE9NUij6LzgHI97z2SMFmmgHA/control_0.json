There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The scenario is that during a test, the classmate was using their phone to get answers. The reporter went to the teacher after the test and told them, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered wrong in academic settings. The teacher's role is to enforce rules, so reporting cheating is a responsibility. But there's a nuance here. The reporter saw the classmate using a phone. But was there enough evidence? The teacher didn't count the grade, so maybe they took the report seriously. However, sometimes students might use phones for other reasons\u2014a calculator, notes for a disability, or even a mistake. Did the reporter have definitive proof it was cheating? If the teacher didn't act immediately, maybe they wanted to investigate further. But the user says they told the teacher after everyone left, which might prevent the classmate from defending themselves. \n\nBut the main point is whether the reporter was wrong. Cheating is a serious offense. If the report was true, then the teacher handled it. But if the report was based on insufficient evidence, that's a problem. The user mentions they saw the classmate looking at the phone and writing answers, which seems plausible. However, without the teacher's confirmation, there's a chance of a false accusation. But in many schools, reporting suspected cheating is part of integrity policies. So the teacher's action here suggests they believed the report. \n\nOn the other hand, the reporter didn't confront the classmate first or give them a chance to explain. Reporting anonymously might have been better. But the teacher still handled it. The user's reasoning is that they studied hard, so they felt justified. That's common in these situations. The key here is whether the action was right. Since the teacher acted and the classmate was penalized, it's possible the report was valid. However, some might argue that the reporter shouldn't have acted alone without more evidence. But in many cases, students are encouraged to report cheating. So the answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a counter-argument about due process. However, the teacher's response seems to validate the report. So probably B.\n"
