There was this classmate sitting in front of me and when I finished my test, I saw her looking at her phone and writing down answers. For me it was pretty obvious that she had the answers on her smartphone. After the test finished I went to my teacher after everyone was gone and said to her: \"Mrs, this classmate cheated on the test\". Of course my teacher didn't count her grade on the test.\n\nAITA for snitching my classmate cheating on a test most of us studied really hard for? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported a classmate for cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the classmate was caught using a phone during a test. The author saw this and told the teacher, leading to the classmate's grade being invalidated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the school has a clear policy against cheating and encourages reporting it, then the author did the right thing. But if there's no such policy, maybe it's different. However, usually, schools do have anti-cheating policies.\n\nNext, the intent. The author wanted to maintain fairness because they studied hard. Cheating undermines the effort of others. So reporting it could be seen as upholding integrity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author is a \"snitch,\" but that term is often used pejoratively. However, if the action was based on clear evidence (seeing the classmate on a phone during the test), it's a responsible report.\n\nPotential consequences: The classmate was caught and dealt with appropriately. The teacher handled it after the fact, which is standard. No evidence that the author had ulterior motives, like personal grudges.\n\nSo, the author acted according to school rules and protected the fairness of the test. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe if the author didn't have enough evidence, but in this case, seeing the classmate with a phone is sufficient. Yeah, I think B is correct.\n"
