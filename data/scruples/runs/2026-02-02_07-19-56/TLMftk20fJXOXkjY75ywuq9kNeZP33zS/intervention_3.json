I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She previously was in a five-year relationship with a woman and identifies as bisexual, but now is in a heterosexual relationship. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride events with her friends, some of whom are gay and some straight. The author is uncomfortable with this because he feels like she's erasing their relationship by participating in Pride as if she's still gay. The girlfriend had a breakdown and left, saying the author is trying to erase her sexuality and make her be straight to protect his insecurities. She feels part of the LGBT community and wants to support it, even though she's currently in a hetero relationship. The author compares it to a lesbian woman going to straight bars for Pride, implying it's not the same. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is not homophobic but is uncomfortable with his girlfriend's participation in Pride events. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual and feels connected to the LGBT community. The author's issue is that he feels she's not part of the community now because she's in a hetero relationship, so attending Pride is confusing or erasing their relationship. The girlfriend feels marginalized in both straight and LGBT communities and sees Pride as a way to express her identity and support the community.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of the relationship. The author is in a committed relationship and feels that his girlfriend's actions might imply she's not fully committed, even though she says she isn't. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is asserting her identity as bisexual and her right to support the community she feels part of. \n\nThis seems like a conflict between the author's feelings of insecurity and the girlfriend's need to maintain her identity and community connections. In relationships, trust and respect for each other's identities are crucial. The author is questioning her right to participate in events that he sees as conflicting with their relationship, but the girlfriend's perspective is that her sexual orientation isn't contingent on her current relationship status. \n\nBisexuality is about being attracted to more than one gender, and being in a hetero relationship doesn't negate that. The author's comparison to a lesbian going to straight bars might not hold because the context is different\u2014Pride events are specifically for the LGBT community, and attending them is about solidarity and identity, not about seeking new relationships. \n\nThe author's stance could be seen as invalidating his girlfriend's identity. Even though he's not homophobic, his discomfort suggests that he might not fully understand or respect her bisexuality. The girlfriend's breakdown indicates that this issue is significant for her, and the author's response may have been dismissive of her feelings and identity. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions (arguing and making her feel like she needs to be straight) might be the issue here. The girlfriend is expressing her need to feel part of the community she's connected to, and the author is resisting that. This could be a case of the author projecting his insecurities onto her, rather than supporting her identity. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he is not respecting his girlfriend's identity and community ties, which are important to her. His comparison and insistence that she isn't part of the community anymore could be invalidating her bisexuality and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity.\n"
