I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the girlfriend identifies as bisexual and wants to attend Gay Pride events, while the boyfriend feels uncomfortable with it because she's in a heterosexual relationship now. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend isn't homophobic and supports individual rights, but he feels that attending Gay Pride as someone in a straight relationship erases their relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that her bisexuality is part of her identity and that attending Pride is important for her to connect with a community that once ostracized her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity and community inclusion. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Even if she's currently in a heterosexual relationship, her identity isn't defined solely by her current partner. The boyfriend's concern might stem from feeling that her participation in Gay Pride could lead to assumptions by others about her relationship status, but that's a common misunderstanding. The girlfriend's right to identify with the LGBT+ community should be respected, as her sexuality isn't exclusive to her current relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that she can't be in the LGBT+ community while in a heterosexual relationship is problematic. Sexual orientation isn't determined by current relationship status. Bisexual people can be in straight relationships and still identify with the LGBT+ community. The idea that she must choose between the privileges of a straight relationship and community support is a false dichotomy. She can participate in Pride events as an ally and as a bisexual person, regardless of her current relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction indicates that this issue is significant to her identity and mental health. Feeling erased or invalidated can cause emotional distress. The boyfriend's comment that she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship dismisses her bisexuality. Bisexuality includes attraction to both genders, so even in a straight relationship, she remains part of the LGBT+ spectrum.\n\nSupporting Pride events doesn't mean she's not committed to her relationship. Many people in monogamous relationships participate in community events without any intention of straying. The boyfriend's insecurity about her potential for cheating isn't justified by her attending Pride alone. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and his reaction might indicate underlying issues of insecurity rather than a valid concern about her actions.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and respect for identity, the boyfriend is in the wrong by invalidating his partner's sexuality and community ties. The girlfriend is expressing her authentic self, which should be supported. The argument highlights a lack of understanding of bisexuality and the importance of community for people who have faced marginalization.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's stance is based on misconceptions about bisexuality and community belonging. The correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his partner's identity and the significance of Pride events to her.\n"
