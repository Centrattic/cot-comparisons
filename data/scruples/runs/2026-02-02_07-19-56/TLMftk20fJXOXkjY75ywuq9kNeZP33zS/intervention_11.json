I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to gay pride events. The author mentions they're not homophobic and support people's rights, but they take issue with their girlfriend, who is in a heterosexual relationship now, still attending Pride with her bi friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main argument is that their girlfriend is in a straight relationship and thus shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore, which makes them feel erased or not fully accepted. Their girlfriend, on the other hand, explains that she was previously in a 5-year relationship with a woman and identifies as bisexual. She feels that attending Pride is important for her to connect with a community she once was part of and to support the cause, even though she's now in a straight relationship. The author's stance seems to stem from insecurity, thinking that her presence at Pride might imply she's still gay and not fully committed to their relationship.\n\nNow, understanding bisexuality. Bisexual people can be in any type of relationship, and their identity isn't solely defined by their current partner. The author's girlfriend is still part of the LGBT community as a bisexual individual, regardless of her current relationship status. The author's argument that she can't have both the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBT community's support is problematic because it conflates identity with relationship status. Being in a straight relationship doesn't negate her sexual orientation or her right to support a cause she believes in.\n\nThe author's comparison to a female couple attending straight bars and pride events is a bit off. For one, in a female couple, both partners are part of the LGBT community, so attending Pride would be affirming their shared identity. In the author's case, the girlfriend is part of the LGBT community (as bi), but the author is straight, so the dynamic is different. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto her, not recognizing her valid identity and her reasons for participating in Pride events.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to highlight that the author is making her feel like she has to hide her sexuality, which is a form of erasure. The author is denying her the right to express her identity and support her community, which is hurtful and invalidates her feelings. Also, the idea that one must act in a certain way to avoid \"assumptions\" from others (like gay friends assuming she's still gay) is something the author can't control and shouldn't impose on her. People in the community should accept her as she is, regardless of her current relationship.\n\nThe author's claim that they support gay pride but find it hurtful is contradictory. Supporting the cause should mean supporting all individuals within the LGBT community, including bisexual people. The author's insecurities might be leading them to misunderstand or invalidate their girlfriend's identity and needs. The girlfriend's breakdown indicates that the author's words were deeply hurtful, which suggests that they overstepped.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not respecting their girlfriend's identity and the importance of her connecting with her community. Bisexual individuals are part of the LGBT community, and supporting Pride is a way to show solidarity. The author's argument is based on a flawed understanding of sexual orientation and community identity. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
