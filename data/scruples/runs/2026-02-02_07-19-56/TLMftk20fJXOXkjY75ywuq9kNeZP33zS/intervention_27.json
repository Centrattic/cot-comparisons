I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who was previously in a same-sex relationship. She identifies as bisexual, having never been attracted to a guy before the author. They've been together for three years and are generally happy. The issue arises because the author is uncomfortable with her attending Gay Pride, feeling that since she's in a straight relationship now, she's erasing their relationship by participating in LGBT events. The girlfriend had an emotional breakdown, feeling that the author is invalidating her sexuality and making her \"be straight\" to accommodate his insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of bisexuality. If the girlfriend identifies as bi, then her attractions aren't limited to just one gender. Her participation in Pride events could be about supporting the community and her identity, not about actively pursuing relationships. The author's argument is that she's not part of the LGBT community now because she's in a straight relationship, but bisexuality doesn't depend on current relationship status. Being bi means attraction to more than one gender, regardless of current partners.\n\nThe author's main concern seems to be about feeling erased or that her attending Pride undermines their relationship. However, it's important to recognize that supporting a cause doesn't equate to seeking a relationship. The author might be conflating her participation in Pride with a rejection of their relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction highlights that her identity is part of her, and feeling that her partner doesn't accept that part can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he supports gay pride but finds it hurtful. This is a bit contradictory. Supporting the cause while being upset about his partner's involvement suggests a lack of understanding or acceptance of her identity. The girlfriend's point about not being accepted by either community\u2014straight or LGBT\u2014because of her bisexuality adds another layer. She's in a marginalized group herself, and the author's reaction might be contributing to her feeling invalidated.\n\nThe author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars might not be entirely fair. The context and intent matter here. For a bisexual person, attending Pride can be about solidarity and celebrating their identity, not seeking a relationship. The author's discomfort could stem from insecurity or a lack of understanding about bisexuality. His statement that she's not gay until she's in a gay relationship is a bit reductive. Sexual identity isn't solely determined by relationship status but by self-identification and attraction.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach of expressing his feelings without validating hers might have contributed to the breakdown. The girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that she feels her identity is under attack. The author's focus on his insecurities and the idea that she's \"erasing\" their relationship by attending Pride might not take into account her need to express her identity.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's stance seems to be based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the role of community events. He's imposing his own comfort on her identity without fully acknowledging her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is a natural response to feeling that her partner doesn't accept her as she is. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because he's not respecting her identity and the importance of Pride events for her, while not considering her feelings adequately.\n"
