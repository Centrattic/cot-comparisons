I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether they're the asshole for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as not homophobic and supports people being who they are. The girlfriend is bi, previously in a same-sex relationship, and now in a hetero one. She wants to go to Pride annually. The author feels she's erasing their relationship by participating in Pride events since she's in a straight relationship now. The girlfriend is upset, feeling her identity is being erased by the author's stance.\n\nThe author's argument is that if she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community. But the girlfriend argues that bisexuality is part of her identity and that Pride is important for her. The author also mentions insecurity about her being around other women.\n\nHmm, bisexuality is a valid orientation. Even if she's in a hetero relationship, her identity might still include being bi. Pride events are for the entire LGBT community, including bisexual people. The author's stance seems to dismiss her identity. Plus, supporting Pride doesn't mean she's not committed to the relationship. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight bars isn't quite the same because being bi is part of the LGBT spectrum. The author might be projecting their insecurities onto her actions. The key issue is the author invalidating her identity for their own comfort, which isn't fair. So, probably the author is in the wrong.\n"
