I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of that \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with a girlfriend who used to be in a five-year relationship with a woman. She identifies as bisexual, saying she's never been attracted to a guy until her current boyfriend. Now, they've been together for three years, and the author is okay with being in a hetero relationship. However, the girlfriend goes to Gay Pride events every year, and the author is upset about that. He feels like it erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. The girlfriend is passionate about the cause and feels part of the LGBT community despite being with a guy. The argument escalated, leading to a breakdown where she said the author is making her be straight and not accepting her sexuality. She's even left home, and the author is questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend identifies as bi, which is a valid sexual orientation. She's in a hetero relationship but still feels a connection to the LGBT community. The author is uncomfortable with her attending Pride events because he sees it as her not being fully part of the community now that she's with a guy. But bisexuality is about being attracted to more than one gender. So if she's bi, being in a hetero relationship doesn't negate her identity. The author's argument seems to hinge on the idea that if she's in a hetero relationship, she can't be part of the LGBT community. That's a flawed understanding of bisexuality and LGBT inclusivity. \n\nAlso, the author compares it to a lesbian couple going to straight bars and straight pride events. But that's not the same scenario because the girlfriend is part of a hetero relationship, whereas a same-sex couple isn't part of the straight community. The dynamics here are different. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions, assuming that attending Pride means she's not committed to their relationship. However, the girlfriend has stated she's not looking elsewhere and is committed. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about her participation in Pride events, which the girlfriend sees as a way to celebrate her identity and support a community that has faced discrimination. The author is dismissing her need to express her identity, which could be seen as invalidating her sexuality. By not accepting her bisexuality and her desire to support the community, the author is indeed erasing part of her identity. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this is a significant emotional issue for her. The author's response was to question her belonging to the community, which could be hurtful. The fact that she's left home indicates the argument was serious, and his perspective might be contributing to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like his stance is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the importance of community for individuals with diverse sexual orientations. The author is not respecting his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in events that are meaningful to her. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong.\n"
