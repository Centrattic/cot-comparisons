I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. He's not homophobic and supports the rights of the LGBT community. His issue is that his girlfriend, who is currently in a heterosexual relationship, still identifies as bisexual and wants to go to Pride events. He feels like it erases their relationship because she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. She, on the other hand, feels that her sexuality is still part of her identity and that Pride is important for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. She's in a current heterosexual relationship but still feels a connection to the LGBT community. The author is uncomfortable with her attending Pride because it conflicts with his perception of her being in a straight relationship. \n\nThe key points are about identity versus relationship status. The author is conflating her relationship status with her identity. Bisexuality is about attraction to more than one gender, not necessarily being in a same-sex relationship. So even if she's in a heterosexual relationship, her identity as bisexual doesn't change. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, which includes bisexuality. \n\nThe author's argument that she can't be part of both the straight and LGBT community is a false dichotomy. People can be part of multiple communities. Additionally, his comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events is flawed because the context and purpose differ. Straight bars aren't about celebrating a marginalized community, whereas Pride is about solidarity and history. \n\nThe girlfriend's emotional response indicates that this is a significant issue for her. Feeling erased from her identity could cause genuine harm to her sense of self. The author's refusal to acknowledge her bisexuality based on her current relationship is invalidating. The fact that he's causing her to question their future together shows the conflict is deep-rooted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not respecting his girlfriend's identity. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and attending Pride is a way for her to connect with her community. His reasoning is based on his insecurities rather than her actual identity. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not supporting her in this aspect and making her feel she needs to choose between her identity and their relationship.\n"
