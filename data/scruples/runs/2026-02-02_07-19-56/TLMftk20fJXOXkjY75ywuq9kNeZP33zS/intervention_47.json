I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events because she's in a heterosexual relationship now, even though she identifies as bisexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. The author is okay with her being bi but is uncomfortable with her attending Pride events, thinking that since she's in a straight relationship, she's erasing their relationship by participating in LGBT events. The girlfriend argues that she still feels part of the LGBT community because of her bisexuality and the historical challenges the community has faced. She also mentions feeling caught between two worlds when she's in either a straight or LGBT space.\n\nThe author argues that if the girlfriend is in a straight relationship, she can't have the privileges of both straight and LGBT communities. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her sexuality isn't erased by her current relationship and that her bisexuality is a core part of her identity, regardless of her current partner.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of bisexuality, it's a valid sexual orientation where a person is attracted to both genders. Just because someone is in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate their bisexuality. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, which includes bisexual individuals. The author's concern seems to stem from insecurity or a lack of understanding about bisexuality. He might be conflating relationship status with sexual identity. \n\nThe girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity and advocacy, not about her current relationship. It's possible the author is projecting his feelings of exclusion or insecurity onto her actions. The fact that she was previously in a same-sex relationship and still identifies as bi suggests that her identity is an important part of who she is. \n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both straight and LGBT privileges is a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and hold various identities. Moreover, the author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't quite equivalent because the context and societal acceptance differ. \n\nThe emotional response from the girlfriend, storming out and breaking down, indicates that this issue is significant to her. The author's insistence on her not attending Pride might be dismissing her identity and her community's importance. The key here is whether the author is respecting his partner's identity and her right to participate in events that affirm her sexuality, even if he doesn't fully understand her need for it. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's stance seems to prioritize his own comfort over his partner's identity. The question is whether his disapproval is valid or if it's an infringement on her autonomy. Since the girlfriend isn't in a same-sex relationship but still identifies as bi, her participation in Pride is a legitimate expression of her identity. Therefore, the author's disapproval could be seen as invalidating her identity. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his partner's sexual identity and the importance of her community to her well-being and sense of self.\n"
