I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship but identifies as bisexual. He's been in the relationship for three years, and she's been in a previous same-sex relationship. He's upset that she's going to Pride events, feeling it erases their relationship and that she's still part of the LGBT community even though she's in a straight relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. Being part of the LGBT community isn't just about current relationships but also about identity. The author's argument is that since she's in a heterosexual relationship now, she shouldn't participate in Pride events. But bisexuality isn't about being in a relationship with one gender at a time; it's a part of her identity. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the entire LGBT community, not just those in same-sex relationships.\n\nThe author might feel insecure or threatened, thinking that attending Pride could make her less committed to the relationship. However, that's a projection of his feelings onto her. The girlfriend explains that she's part of a community that has historically marginalized her and that she needs that space to express her identity. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality and the importance of community for her. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014having a breakdown\u2014suggests deep emotional impact from his words. She feels he's erasing her sexuality by making her conform to straight norms. The key here is understanding that being bisexual doesn't change with relationship status. The author is conflating her identity with her current relationship, which isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of societal context, the author's argument could be seen as exclusionary. The LGBT community is diverse, and bisexuality is a valid part of that. Pride events are for everyone in the community, regardless of their current relationship status. The author's insistence that she can't participate because she's in a straight relationship might be dismissive of her ongoing identity as a bisexual person.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting her identity and the importance of community for her. His insecurity shouldn't override her need to participate in events that affirm her identity. The answer should be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
