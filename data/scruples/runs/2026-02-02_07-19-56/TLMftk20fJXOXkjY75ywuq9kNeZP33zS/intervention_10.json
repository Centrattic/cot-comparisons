I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend's desire to attend Pride events. \n\nFirst, the author is in a heterosexual relationship but identifies as bisexual. The girlfriend has been in a previous same-sex relationship and still identifies as part of the LGBT community. She wants to go to Pride annually with friends, both gay and straight. The author feels that since she's in a straight relationship now, attending Pride might erase their relationship and that she's not part of the community anymore.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and community. The girlfriend explains that being part of the LGBT community isn't just about current relationships but also about her sexual orientation and past experiences. The author's argument seems to hinge on the idea that once someone is in a straight relationship, they lose their connection to the LGBT community, which might not be accurate. Sexual orientation is complex, and many people in straight relationships still identify with the LGBT community if they are bisexual or have a history of same-sex relationships.\n\nThe author's concern might stem from insecurity or a desire to be seen as exclusive, but the girlfriend's right to express her identity and participate in events that matter to her is important. The author's comparison to a female couple attending straight bars is a bit off because the context and purpose of Pride are different. Pride is about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, not about current relationship status.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was emotional, but it's understandable given that her identity and sense of belonging are at stake. The author might be projecting their own feelings of insecurity onto her actions. The fact that the author is questioning their own stance shows they have some self-awareness, but their argument may not fully respect her identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because the girlfriend's participation in Pride is a valid part of her identity, and the author is dismissing her feelings and experiences. The right to participate in community events shouldn't be contingent on current relationship status, especially for someone who identifies as bisexual."
