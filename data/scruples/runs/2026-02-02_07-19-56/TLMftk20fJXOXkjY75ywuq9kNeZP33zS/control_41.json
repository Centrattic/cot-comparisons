I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to go to gay pride. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he's not homophobic and supports people being themselves. His girlfriend is bisexual, previously in a same-sex relationship, now in a heterosexual one with him. She wants to attend Pride events, which he objects to because she's in a straight relationship now. He feels she's erasing their relationship by being part of the LGBT community still. She got upset, said he was erasing her sexuality, and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend identifies as bi, which is a valid sexual orientation. Attending Pride events isn't about being in a relationship but about supporting a community. The author's issue is that since she's in a straight relationship, he feels her presence at Pride is contradictory. But bisexuality includes attraction to both genders, so her identity isn't negated by being in a straight relationship. \n\nThe author might be conflating her identity with her current relationship status. He's suggesting that she can't be part of the LGBT community now, which is incorrect. Bisexual people can be in straight relationships but still identify as part of the LGBT community. The girlfriend's need to attend Pride is about her personal identity and support for the community, not about the relationship. \n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both straight privileges and be part of the LGBT community is a bit of a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities. Also, his comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight events is flawed because the context and experiences are different. \n\nHe might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions. His comment about her \"being straight to protect his insecurities\" shows he's not fully accepting her identity. The girlfriend's emotional reaction indicates the issue is significant to her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the purpose of Pride events. His girlfriend's identity isn't erased by her current relationship. The fact that he caused her to leave suggests that his approach was hurtful. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
