I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend going to Gay Pride, and he's upset about it because she's in a heterosexual relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he's not homophobic and supports people being who they are. But he's uncomfortable with his girlfriend, who identifies as bisexual, attending Pride events now that she's in a straight relationship. He feels like she's erasing their relationship by still participating in the LGBT community. The girlfriend, on the other hand, explains that she was previously in a same-sex relationship, is still bisexual, and needs to feel part of the community that accepted her before. She got upset and left because he made her feel like she has to be straight for his insecurities.\n\nSo the key points here are: the girlfriend's identity as bisexual and her connection to the LGBT community. Bisexual people can still be part of the LGBT community even if they're in a heterosexual relationship. The author might not understand that bisexuality is a valid orientation and that her participation in Pride is about her identity, not just her current relationship status. \n\nThe author's argument is that since she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community. But that's a common misconception. Sexual orientation isn't defined solely by current relationships. Being bisexual means being attracted to both genders, and that doesn't change based on who you're dating. So the girlfriend's identity as bisexual and her support for the community are valid. \n\nThe author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or a misunderstanding of bisexuality. By telling her she can't have both the privileges of a straight relationship and the community, he's invalidating her identity. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a result of feeling erased. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the importance of her community. The girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her sense of self and support for a cause, which the author isn't acknowledging. His projection of insecurity onto her choices is problematic. \n\nSo the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
