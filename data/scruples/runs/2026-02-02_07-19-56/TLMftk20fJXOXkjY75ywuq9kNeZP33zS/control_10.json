I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that his girlfriend, who recently transitioned from a same-sex relationship to a heterosexual one, still wants to attend Gay Pride events. The author feels that by doing so, she's not fully embracing their hetero relationship and is erasing their relationship by participating in the LGBT community. The girlfriend is upset and left, feeling her identity is being erased.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author claims he's not homophobic and respects everyone's rights. He's in a three-year relationship with a woman who is bisexual, as she's never been attracted to men before him. The issue is her attending Pride events even though she's in a hetero relationship now. The author feels it's contradictory, like she's trying to have the privileges of a straight relationship while still being part of the LGBT community. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that her bisexuality isn't negated by her current relationship. She needs Pride as a space where she feels accepted, having faced exclusion from both straight and LGBT communities before. She also mentions that she's passionate about the cause and that it's important for her to support the community.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Bisexuality and Identity**: The girlfriend identifies as bisexual. Bisexual people can be in heterosexual relationships but still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author's stance that she isn't \"gay\" until she's in a same-sex relationship might be invalidating her identity. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and participation in Pride events is about supporting the community, not just personal relationships.\n\n2. **Community Participation**: Pride events are for celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, which includes people of various orientations. The author's argument that she's erasing their relationship by attending Pride might not hold because her participation is more about solidarity and her own identity, not about her current relationship status. The analogy the author makes about a same-sex couple attending straight events is a bit different because the primary community for a same-sex couple is the LGBT community, whereas for a bisexual person, they can participate in both if they choose.\n\n3. **Respect and Trust**: The author's main concern seems to be about feeling insecure or threatened by her participation. The girlfriend feels her identity is being erased, leading to emotional distress. In a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's identities and communities. The author's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than a valid issue with her actions. The girlfriend's breakdown and stating she can't see a future with him if he keeps invalidating her sexuality suggests that this is a significant issue affecting their relationship.\n\n4. **Communication and Understanding**: The author's approach to discussing his feelings led to a breakdown in communication. Instead of expressing his hurt, he made judgments about her community involvement. A better approach might have been to discuss his feelings of insecurity and seek a compromise rather than dismissing her identity.\n\n5. **Privileges and Double Standards**: The author's comment about not wanting her to expect the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBT community at the same time is problematic. It implies that one can't belong to both, which isn't the case. People can have multiple identities and communities. The comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars is not entirely fair, as the primary community for same-sex couples is the LGBT community, whereas the bisexual individual is part of both. However, the author's hypothetical is a bit of a stretch because attending a straight event is different from attending a Pride event, which is specifically for the LGBT community.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's main issue is with his girlfriend's identity and community participation, which he perceives as contradictory to their relationship. However, her bisexuality and continued participation in Pride events are valid aspects of her identity that shouldn't be erased. The author's reaction comes off as controlling and invalidating her feelings, which can be harmful in a relationship. The girlfriend's emotional response and the fact that she feels her future is in question indicate that the author's actions are hurting her and the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the importance of her participation in the LGBT community, despite being in a heterosexual relationship. His insecurities and the way he addressed them have caused harm and a breakdown in their communication.\n"
