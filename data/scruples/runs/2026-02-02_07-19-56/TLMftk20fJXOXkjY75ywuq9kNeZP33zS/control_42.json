I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. The girlfriend is bisexual, was previously in a same-sex relationship, and now is in a heterosexual relationship with the author. The author feels that her attending Pride is erasing their relationship and that she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. The girlfriend, however, feels that her identity is still part of the LGBT community and that she needs to express that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is not homophobic but is uncomfortable with his girlfriend participating in Pride. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which means she can be attracted to both genders. Being part of the LGBT community isn't just about current relationships but also about one's identity. The author seems to think that since she's in a heterosexual relationship, she's no longer part of the LGBT community, which might not be accurate. Bisexual people can be part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner's gender.\n\nThe author's argument is that her attending Pride might lead others to assume she's still gay, which could make him uncomfortable. But bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT spectrum. The girlfriend mentions that she's been outcast by both straight and LGBT communities, which is a real issue some bisexual people face. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her identity and the community she feels connected to. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's breakdown and saying she can't see a future with him if he keeps \"erasing her sexuality\" suggests that this is a significant emotional issue for her. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight pride events might be a valid analogy, but it's important to recognize that the LGBT community includes people of various identities, including bisexual individuals. \n\nThe author's insecurity might be playing a role here, as he mentions protecting his insecurities. It's about whether his feelings are valid but not overriding his girlfriend's right to her identity. The key point is that the girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity and community, which shouldn't be dependent on her current relationship status. \n\nSo, considering that the author is not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the community she feels part of, even though he's in a heterosexual relationship, it's likely that he is in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's dismissing her valid identity and needs, and his insecurities are affecting their relationship negatively.\n"
