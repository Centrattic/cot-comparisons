I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to gay pride. Let me start by breaking down both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as not homophobic and supports people being themselves. They're in a three-year relationship with a girlfriend who was previously in a same-sex relationship. She identifies as bi now, saying she's open to both genders but hasn't been with a guy before. The issue is that she goes to gay pride events every year, and the author feels it erases their current relationship, making it seem like she's still gay. The author is hurt because they think she's part of the straight relationship now, so attending these events is confusing or conflicting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels she's part of the LGBT community because she's bisexual. She's part of a community that's been through struggles, and pride is important to her. She's facing a dilemma where she's not accepted by either the straight or LGBT communities fully. She's passionate about the cause and sees her bisexuality as valid. The author's refusal to support her attending pride is making her feel erased.\n\nSo, from a broader perspective, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. Being part of the LGBT community isn't just about current relationships but about identity. The girlfriend is expressing her identity and supporting a cause she cares about. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or fear of not being accepted, but that doesn't make the author right. The author is trying to control the girlfriend's participation in her own community, which can be seen as invalidating her identity.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing valid feelings of hurt and confusion. They might feel that attending gay pride could lead to assumptions or confusion about her sexuality, but that's more about their own insecurities. It's possible the author needs to work on trust and understanding that their partner's identity isn't contingent on her current relationship status.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't being homophobic, but they're imposing their feelings on the girlfriend. The key here is that the girlfriend's identity as bisexual is real and should be respected. The author's actions are preventing her from expressing that part of herself. So, the author is in the wrong because they're invalidating her identity and not supporting her participation in an important community event. The girlfriend's actions are about her identity and support for her community, which the author should respect regardless of his own discomfort.\n"
