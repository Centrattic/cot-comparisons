I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting their girlfriend to go to gay pride. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual and has a history of being in a same-sex relationship. She goes to pride events every year, and the author is upset because she's in a heterosexual relationship now. He feels like she's erasing their relationship by participating in pride. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She mentioned she was outcasted by the straight community when she was in a same-sex relationship and now feels like she's not accepted in the LGBT community because she's in a straight relationship. She's using pride as a way to express her identity and support the community. Her bisexuality is part of her identity regardless of her current relationship status. So, the author's objection might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding.\n\nThe author argues that she can't have the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBT community at the same time. That seems like a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and have different aspects of their identity. Being bi means she's attracted to more than one gender, so her participation in pride events is valid regardless of her current partner. The author's comparison to a female couple going to straight bars might not hold because the context and reasons for attending such events differ. Pride events are about celebrating identity and support for the community, not just about current relationship status.\n\nThe girlfriend had a breakdown and is considering leaving the relationship, which suggests that the author's words hurt her deeply. His comment about her \"needing to be straight\" to protect his insecurities implies that he's prioritizing his feelings over her identity. That's a red flag in a relationship. The author might be projecting his discomfort onto her, not respecting her right to maintain her identity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid in that he might feel excluded or insecure. But the way he expressed them was harmful. The key issue is whether his feelings justify controlling her behavior. No, controlling behavior isn't acceptable. The right approach would be to communicate his feelings without dismissing her identity. The author's stance seems to invalidate her bisexuality and the importance of her participation in pride events, which is not supportive of her authentic self.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the significance of her participation in the LGBT community. His insecurity shouldn't override her right to express her bisexuality and support for the community she's part of.\n"
