I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend identifies as bisexual, is in a heterosexual relationship with the author, but still goes to Gay Pride events. The author is uncomfortable with this, thinking it erases their relationship and that she's acting as if she's still gay. They had an argument about it, and now she's left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She mentions she was previously in a 5-year same-sex relationship and identifies as bi. She's part of the LGBT community historically and still supports it. She goes to Pride events with friends, both gay and straight. She feels like she can express her pride there and that it's important for her identity. Also, she's facing a kind of double exclusion\u2014outcast by straights because she's bi and not fully accepted by the LGBT community because she's in a hetero relationship. That's a real issue many people in the queer community face, especially those who are bisexual. They often feel like they don't belong fully in either group.\n\nThe author argues that since she's in a hetero relationship now, she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. But bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, not about current relationship status. So even if she's dating a guy now, her identity as bi doesn't change. Pride events are about celebrating the entire LGBT community, including bisexual people. So attending Pride as a bi person is valid.\n\nThe author's concern about the community assuming she's gay when she's in a straight relationship might be a personal insecurity. The girlfriend's point about not having to \"be straight\" to protect his feelings seems valid. It's about respecting her identity regardless of her current relationship. Also, the analogy the author makes about a female-female couple going to straight events is a bit off because the context is different. If someone is in a same-sex relationship but chooses to attend events associated with another orientation, that's different from someone in a straight relationship attending Pride. But in this case, the girlfriend is part of the bi community, which is included under the LGBT umbrella.\n\nThe author's statement that she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship is incorrect. Orientation isn't determined by current relationships but by one's attractions. Being bi means being attracted to both genders, so even in a hetero relationship, she still identifies as bi. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity about her sexuality, which is a personal issue that needs to be addressed, not a justification for dismissing her identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's emotional reaction and the fact that she's left the house indicate that the author's words were hurtful. Making her feel like she has to hide her identity to accommodate his insecurities is not supportive. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her sexuality and the importance of her community to her. That's a serious issue in a relationship because it's about mutual respect and acceptance.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if they're the asshole. Considering the girlfriend's perspective and the broader context of bisexuality and community inclusion, the author's position seems to be based on a misunderstanding of her identity and the nature of Pride events. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
