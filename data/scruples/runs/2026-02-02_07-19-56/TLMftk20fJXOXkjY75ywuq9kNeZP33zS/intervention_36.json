I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend gay pride events. The author identifies as not homophobic, but he's uncomfortable because his girlfriend, who is in a heterosexual relationship now, still goes to Pride. He feels it erases their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. She's active in the LGBT community, attending Pride events with friends. The author's issue is that he sees her participation in Pride as not aligning with her current heterosexual relationship. But she argues that bisexuality is part of her identity regardless of her current relationship status, and that Pride is important for her to feel connected to the community.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal identity, bisexuality is an inherent part of someone's sexuality regardless of their current partner. So if she's bi, her participation in Pride events is a valid expression of her identity. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or a misunderstanding of how sexual orientation works. He's comparing it to a same-sex partner going to straight events, which is a different scenario because the context of the relationship and the community's purpose might differ. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional reaction\u2014having a breakdown\u2014suggests that this is a significant issue for her. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating her identity, which can be hurtful. The concept of \"erasing her sexuality\" is a strong accusation, implying that by not supporting her attendance, he's not acknowledging her bisexuality. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that her presence in Pride events could lead to assumptions by others, but that's more about societal perceptions rather than her identity. However, his argument about not expecting both straight privileges and LGBT community inclusion might be a bit of a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and their relationships can coexist without conflict.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, the key is mutual respect. If the author truly supports her, he should respect her need to connect with her community, even if he doesn't fully understand it. His discomfort leading to conflict might be more about his own insecurities than her actions. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance seems to be in the wrong because he's not respecting her identity and the importance of Pride to her. His argument that she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" misunderstands bisexuality, which is a valid orientation regardless of current partner. The girlfriend's feeling that her sexuality is being erased is a valid concern, and the author's reaction might be causing unnecessary harm.\n"
