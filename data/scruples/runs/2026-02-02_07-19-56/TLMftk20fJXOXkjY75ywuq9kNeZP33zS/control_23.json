I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the argument. The guy is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with her friends, some of whom are gay and some straight. He's upset because he feels that her attending Pride as part of the LGBT community erases their current relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. His girlfriend is upset, sees Pride as important to her identity, and feels he's invalidating her bisexuality. She's even left the house after an argument.\n\nThe guy claims he's not homophobic and supports people's rights to be themselves. However, his main issue is that since she's in a straight relationship now, he doesn't see why she needs to participate in Pride events. He compares it to a same-sex couple going to straight bars for Pride, implying hypocrisy. The girlfriend argues that bisexuality is part of her identity regardless of her current relationship and that Pride is important to her as part of the LGBT community. She also mentions the social stigma she faces from both communities based on her relationship status.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and someone's participation in LGBT events doesn't negate their current relationship status. The man's argument seems to stem from insecurity or a misunderstanding of bisexuality. He's suggesting that only people in same-sex relationships can be part of the LGBT community, which isn't accurate. Bisexual individuals are part of the LGBT community regardless of their current relationship. \n\nHis comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight Pride events is a bit of a flawed analogy because the context and social acceptance differ. Straight Pride isn't recognized in the same way as Gay Pride, and the issues faced by the LGBT community are distinct. The fact that the girlfriend has faced exclusion from both communities based on her relationship status adds another layer of complexity. She's trying to maintain her identity and connection to a community that has historically supported her during her previous relationship. \n\nThe man's insistence that she can't have both the privileges of a straight relationship and the community of the LGBT community is problematic. It's not about privileges but about identity. Being part of a community isn't something that can be switched on or off based on relationship status. The idea that she has to \"be straight\" to make him feel secure is invalidating her sexuality. \n\nMoreover, his reaction led her to have a breakdown and storm out, which suggests that his communication was hurtful. Instead of finding a compromise, he's taking a rigid stance. While it's okay to have concerns, the way he expressed them and the underlying assumptions about bisexuality likely contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the man's perspective is based on a misunderstanding of what it means to be part of the LGBT community and bisexuality. His actions in expressing this, especially leading to her emotional distress, indicate that he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
