I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a woman who was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. The main issue is the author's discomfort with her attending Pride events now that she's in a straight relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She has a history of being in the LGBT community, which is a significant part of her identity. Even though she's currently in a straight relationship, her bisexuality means she still has a connection to that community. Pride events are not only about current relationships but also about celebrating one's identity and supporting the community's history and struggles. The girlfriend feels that going to Pride allows her to express her pride and support for her community, even if her relationship status has changed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that attending Pride under her previous identity might \"erase\" their relationship. He's uncomfortable with the idea of her being around gay women who might assume she's still gay. But this line of thinking might be based on a misunderstanding of bisexual identity. Being bisexual doesn't mean she's not committed to her current relationship. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events is interesting, but Pride is specifically about the LGBT community, so the analogy might not hold. The key difference is that the author is not part of that community, while the girlfriend still identifies as part of it.\n\nThe author's argument that she isn't \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" could be problematic. Bisexuality is a valid orientation regardless of current relationship status. The girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity and support for the community, not about her current relationship. The author's discomfort might be projecting his insecurities onto her, making her feel like she has to choose between her identity and their relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was a breakdown, indicating deep emotional impact. She feels her identity is being erased, which is a serious issue. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality. It's important to recognize that one's community and identity aren't solely defined by current relationships. Pride events are inclusive of all LGBT individuals, including bisexuals, and attending them doesn't negate a current relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might not be in the wrong for having feelings about this, but his perspective may lack understanding of bisexuality and the importance of community for the girlfriend. The core issue is the author's lack of acceptance of her bisexuality beyond just her current relationship. Relationships require compromise, but forcing someone to disengage from a significant part of their identity for the sake of a partner's insecurities is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's position seems to stem from misunderstanding and insecurity, not malice. However, the impact on the girlfriend's sense of identity is significant. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's not respecting her identity and community involvement, which is an essential part of her self-expression.\n"
