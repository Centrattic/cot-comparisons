I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to go to Gay Pride, and the author is upset about it. The author isn't homophobic, but he's uncomfortable because his girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship now. He feels like her attendance at Pride erases their relationship and makes her act like she's still gay. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is bisexual, has a history of being in a same-sex relationship, and feels that Pride is important for her identity and the community. She's also facing pressure from both communities and wants to support the cause.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He might be feeling insecure or threatened by his girlfriend's participation in an event that's historically for LGBTQ+ people. He compares it to a same-sex couple going to straight events, which is a valid analogy, but maybe he's misunderstanding the context of Pride. Pride isn't just for people in same-sex relationships; it's about celebrating and supporting the entire LGBTQ+ community, including bisexual individuals. The girlfriend identifies as bi, so she's part of the LGBTQ+ community even in a heterosexual relationship. The author might not fully grasp that.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's viewpoint. She's part of the community, has faced exclusion from both sides, and finds Pride to be an important event for her identity and solidarity. She's not denying her current relationship but is asserting her right to be part of the community that has been significant in her life. Her emotional reaction suggests that this issue is personal and about her need for acceptance and expression.\n\nNow, considering the principles: Bisexual individuals are part of the LGBTQ+ community regardless of their current relationship. Pride events are about celebrating diversity and history, not just current relationship status. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity rather than a genuine understanding of his girlfriend's identity. By questioning her participation, he might be invalidating her identity and the importance of community support for her. \n\nAlso, the comparison the author makes to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't entirely accurate because Pride is specifically for the LGBTQ+ community, whereas straight events aren't equivalent. The author might be conflating personal relationship validation with community participation. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, he's expressing his feelings, but if he's making his girlfriend feel like she has to hide her identity for his comfort, that's problematic. Supporting each other's identities is a key part of a healthy relationship. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's ongoing identity as a bisexual person and the importance of her community. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice to participate in Pride as part of her identity and the community's history.\n"
