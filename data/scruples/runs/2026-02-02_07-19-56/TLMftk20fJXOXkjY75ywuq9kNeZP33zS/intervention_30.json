I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend going to Gay Pride. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a heterosexual relationship with his girlfriend, who previously was in a same-sex relationship. She identifies as bisexual now. The issue is that the author is upset about her attending Pride events. He feels it's erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. He argues that since she's in a straight relationship now, she shouldn't participate in LGBT events. His girlfriend is upset, feeling like her sexuality is being erased and that he doesn't support her identity.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity and autonomy. The author's problem seems to stem from jealousy or insecurity. He's making assumptions about her participation in Pride, thinking it's about her still being gay, but she clarifies she's bi and supports the cause regardless of her current relationship status.\n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. Just because someone is in a heterosexual relationship doesn't mean they can't identify as bi. The author is dismissing her identity by suggesting she can't be part of the LGBT community anymore. That's a form of invalidation, which can be harmful. Pride events are for celebrating identity and supporting the community, not about current relationship status. The author is trying to control her participation in something that's important to her, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling her identity is being erased. The author's argument that she can't have the privileges of both straight and LGBT communities is a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and have their identities validated without it being a privilege. Also, the comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events is a bit off because the context and reasons for attending different events are different. But the core issue is about respecting her self-identification.\n\nThe author's stance seems to be based on his discomfort and insecurities rather than understanding her perspective. Validating her identity is crucial. The fact that she has attended Pride with friends before and continues to support the cause should be respected. The author is in a position where he needs to accept her as she is, including her participation in events that affirm her identity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are dismissive of her identity and her autonomy. He's making her choose between her past and present, which isn't fair. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
