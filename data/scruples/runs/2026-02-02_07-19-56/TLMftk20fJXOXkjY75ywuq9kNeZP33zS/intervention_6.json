I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend wanting to go to Gay Pride while in a heterosexual relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend is bisexual, having been in a previous same-sex relationship. She wants to attend Pride events again, which the author is uncomfortable with. He feels that since she's in a heterosexual relationship now, she shouldn't identify as part of the LGBT community anymore. The girlfriend is upset, feeling her identity is erased if she stops participating in Pride.\n\nThe author argues that she can't have the privileges of both straight and LGBT communities. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her bisexuality is valid and that she's still part of the community. She also mentions feeling outcasted by both sides because of her past and current relationships.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and validation. Bisexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation where someone can be attracted to more than one gender. Even if she's currently in a straight relationship, her identity isn't erased. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, regardless of current relationship status. The author seems to be implying that her participation in Pride invalidates their relationship, which is a common but incorrect perspective. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings of needing to express her identity and support the community are valid. The author's concern might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding of bisexuality. He's conflating his own comfort with his girlfriend's identity, which isn't fair. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship is factually incorrect regarding bisexuality. Being bi doesn't require being in a same-sex relationship to validate one's identity. The comparison to a female couple attending straight events isn't entirely equitable because the context and history of the community matter. Pride is a specific cultural and historical event for marginalized groups, which bisexuality is part of, even if someone is in a straight relationship now.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the significance of Pride to her. His comments could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality and the community's importance. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given the personal and emotional stakes involved. The author needs to recognize that her participation in Pride is about her identity and support for the community, not a rejection of their relationship.\n"
