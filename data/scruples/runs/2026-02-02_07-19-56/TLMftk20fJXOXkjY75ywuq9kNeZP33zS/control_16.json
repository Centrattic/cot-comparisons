I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a girlfriend who used to be in a same-sex relationship. Now she's with him, but she still wants to go to Gay Pride events. The author is uncomfortable with this because he feels like she's not part of the LGBT community anymore since she's in a straight relationship and that going to Pride erases their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She identifies as bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. She's still part of the LGBT community because bisexuality is part of that spectrum. Even though she's in a heterosexual relationship now, her identity isn't erased by her current relationship status. The author seems to be conflating current relationship status with sexual orientation. So, he's saying she can't be part of the LGBT community because she's with a guy, which might not be accurate. \n\nThe author also mentions that he's not homophobic and supports everyone's rights, but he feels hurt by her attending Pride. He's projecting his own insecurities onto her, thinking she wants to \"explore the other side\" of her sexuality, which might not be true. She's stated that she's committed to their relationship and wants to support the community. \n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her. She's navigating between two communities where she might not feel fully accepted. The author's comment about \"erasing her sexuality\" could be invalidating her identity. If she's bisexual, attending Pride is a way for her to express her identity and support her community. \n\nThe author's analogy about a same-sex couple going to straight bars might not hold because the situation isn't symmetrical. In the author's case, the girlfriend is part of the LGBT community, so attending Pride is affirming her identity. However, if a same-sex couple went to straight events, it might not be the same because the context and community history are different. \n\nAlso, the author is making a judgment about what defines someone's sexuality. He's implying that she's not gay unless she's in a same-sex relationship, but bisexuality allows for attraction to both. His stance might be limiting her identity. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach seems to have been confrontational, leading to a breakdown. Instead of understanding her perspective, he's focusing on his own discomfort. The girlfriend's need to participate in Pride is about her identity and support for a community that has historically marginalized her. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's argument doesn't hold. He's not considering her identity and the importance of community to her. His stance might be rooted in insecurity rather than valid reasoning about her sexuality. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
