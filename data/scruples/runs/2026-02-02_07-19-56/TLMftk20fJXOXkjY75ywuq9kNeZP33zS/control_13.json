I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a three-year relationship with a girlfriend who was previously in a five-year same-sex relationship. She identifies as bisexual now. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with her friends, some of whom are gay, others straight. The author is upset because she's in a hetero relationship now and doesn't want her to go, feeling like she's erasing their relationship by participating in Gay Pride. The girlfriend is passionate about the cause and feels she's part of the LGBT community because of her bisexuality. She had a breakdown when the author brought up his feelings, and she's now left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's not homophobic, but he feels that his girlfriend's attendance at Gay Pride is contradictory. He argues that since she's in a heterosexual relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore. He compares it to if he were in a same-sex relationship and she went to straight bars and straight pride events. He's worried about her being around other gay women and the potential for assumptions, and he feels she's not fully committed to their relationship if she still wants to participate in LGBT events. However, he acknowledges she's bisexual and that she's not straight just because she's with a guy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's part of the LGBT community because she's bisexual, even if she's currently in a hetero relationship. She feels that the straight community didn't accept her when she was in a same-sex relationship, and now the LGBT community might not accept her because she's in a hetero relationship. She sees Pride as a time to celebrate her identity and support the cause. She's upset that the author is trying to make her \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities and that he's erasing her sexuality.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity, acceptance, and mutual respect in the relationship. The author is struggling with his feelings of insecurity and the perception that his girlfriend's participation in Gay Pride undermines their relationship. However, the girlfriend is asserting her bisexuality and her right to be part of the LGBT community regardless of her current relationship status. \n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. It doesn't mean someone is \"halfway\" to being something else; it's its own identity. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events might not be parallel because bisexuality is different from being in a same-sex relationship. Also, the girlfriend's participation in Pride events is about her identity and support for the community, not necessarily a rejection of her current relationship.\n\nThe author's issue seems to stem from insecurity rather than the actual behavior of the girlfriend. The fact that she's in a monogamous relationship and not engaging in any behavior that threatens the relationship complicates the author's stance. He's projecting his feelings onto her actions, which may not be fair. The girlfriend's breakdown suggests that the argument was emotionally charged and that the author's words might have been hurtful, even if his intentions were to express his feelings.\n\nMoreover, the author's statement that she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship is a misunderstanding of bisexuality. Being bisexual doesn't require being in a relationship with either gender at any given time. It's about attraction, not relationship status. The author's erasure of her bisexuality by implying she must choose one orientation based on current relationships is problematic.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author brought up his feelings, but the way he expressed them might have been dismissive of her identity. The girlfriend's response indicates that she feels her identity is important to her and that the author isn't respecting her need to express that. Healthy relationships require both partners to respect each other's identities and boundaries. The author's insistence that she should stop participating in Pride events because of his insecurities could be seen as invalidating her identity.\n\nIn summary, the author's stance seems to be based on insecurity and a misunderstanding of bisexuality. The girlfriend is valid in her need to participate in Pride as part of her identity. The author is in the wrong if he's dismissing her identity and forcing her to conform to his comfort level without considering her feelings and identity. The key here is whether the author respects her bisexuality and her right to be part of the community, which he doesn't seem to be doing.\n"
