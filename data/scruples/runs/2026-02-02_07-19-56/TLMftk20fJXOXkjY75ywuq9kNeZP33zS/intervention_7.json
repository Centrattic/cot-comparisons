I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, having been in a previous same-sex relationship but now in a heterosexual one. The author's main issue is that he feels she's erasing their relationship by participating in Pride when she's not currently in a same-sex relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She mentions that when she was in a relationship with a woman, she was outcast by straight people. Now, in a straight relationship, she's not accepted in the LGBT community. Pride events are important to her as a time to express her identity and support the community. She also emphasizes that she's still bi and wants to support others in the community. Her breakdown and saying she can't see a future with him if he keeps \"erasing her sexuality\" is significant. That suggests deep emotional impact.\n\nFrom the author's side, he's not homophobic and acknowledges her right to be who she is. His concern seems to be about her presence in Pride events conflicting with their current relationship. He compares it to a hypothetical where a female partner in a same-sex relationship goes to straight bars, which might be a fair analogy. But does that make his stance acceptable?\n\nThe key points here might be about personal identity versus relationship dynamics. The girlfriend is asserting her bisexuality and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity, regardless of her current relationship status. The author is struggling with the idea that her presence in Pride might imply she's still part of the LGBT community, which he might perceive as conflicting with their hetero relationship. However, bisexuality is an inherent part of her identity, not just a phase or a reflection of her current partner. So, even if she's in a straight relationship, her bisexuality doesn't disappear. \n\nThe author's argument that she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" might be conflating identity with relationship status. Being bi doesn't require being in a same-sex relationship. Her participation in Pride is about solidarity and personal identity, not necessarily her current relationship. The author's reaction might be stemming from insecurity, as he mentions, which is a personal issue but shouldn't dictate her right to express her identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's response about not being able to see a future with him if he continues to \"erase her sexuality\" is a strong indicator. It shows that her identity is central to her sense of self, and the author's resistance is causing significant distress. In healthy relationships, partners should support each other's identities unless they pose a direct threat to the relationship. Here, her participation in Pride is about her identity, not about being unfaithful or wanting to leave. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's stance is likely the problem here. He's invalidating her identity and the importance of community events to her. Even if he supports Pride in principle, his personal discomfort in this specific situation is causing conflict. The girlfriend's need to express her bisexuality and connect with the community is legitimate, and his reaction is undermining that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
