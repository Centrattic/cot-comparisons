I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is in a heterosexual relationship but identifies as bisexual. She's been with her girlfriend for three years and the author is okay with that. But now, the author is upset that she goes to Gay Pride events. The author's main issue seems to be that since she's in a straight relationship, attending Gay Pride is erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. The author also mentions feeling that she can't have both straight privileges and be part of the LGBT community.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that the author is invalidating her bisexuality. She argues that she's still part of the LGBT community because she's attracted to women and identifies as bi. She also mentions feeling like she's caught between two worlds\u2014straight and LGBT\u2014and that Pride is a way for her to connect with her identity and the community's history. Her breakdown suggests that this issue is really important to her, and she feels erased.\n\nThe author's concern might stem from insecurity or jealousy. They compare it to if the girlfriend went to straight bars, which is a bit of a flawed analogy because straight bars aren't exclusive and don't have the same historical or political significance as Gay Pride. The author's argument that she's not gay until she's in a gay relationship ignores the fact that bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status. \n\nThe key points here are about identity and respect. The author is trying to define the girlfriend's identity based on her current relationship, which is not accurate. Bisexual individuals can be in straight relationships but still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author's stance might be projecting their own discomfort onto the girlfriend's identity. \n\nThe girlfriend's need to participate in Gay Pride isn't about being with women but about her identity and supporting a cause. The author's insistence on her not attending if she's in a straight relationship could be seen as dismissing her sexuality. The author's argument that she can't have both straight privileges and the LGBT community is problematic because it's a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and identities.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach seems confrontational, leading to the girlfriend's emotional reaction. The author's feelings of hurt are valid, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. The girlfriend feeling that the author is erasing her sexuality is a serious accusation and points to a deeper issue in the relationship about acceptance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's stance is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the importance of community for the girlfriend. The author is not respecting her need to express her identity, which is a fundamental part of any relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
