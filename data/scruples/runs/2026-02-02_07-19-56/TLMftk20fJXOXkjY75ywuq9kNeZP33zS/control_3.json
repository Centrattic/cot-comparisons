I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bi. She was previously in a 5-year same-sex relationship. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with friends, some gay, some straight. The author is uncomfortable because she's in a hetero relationship now and feels she's erasing their relationship by going to Pride. The girlfriend is upset, feeling her identity is being erased, and that the author isn't accepting her bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't homophobic, which is clear. The girlfriend identifies as bi, which is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Being in a hetero relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality. So, the author's issue is that he thinks she's not part of the LGBT community now because she's dating a guy. But bisexuality is about attraction, not current relationship status. So, even if she's in a hetero relationship, she's still part of the LGBT community as a bi person.\n\nThe author's argument is similar to saying that if someone is in a same-sex relationship, they can't attend straight events. But the girlfriend's attending Pride is about her identity, not her current relationship. The author might be conflating her current relationship with her identity. The girlfriend feels she's part of the community because of her bisexuality, regardless of her current partner.\n\nThe author's statement that \"she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship\" is problematic. It's like saying bisexuality isn't valid unless someone is in a same-sex relationship. That's a common misconception. Bisexual people can be in hetero or same-sex relationships, but their identity remains. The author is essentially invalidating her identity by suggesting she can only be part of the LGBT community if she's in a same-sex relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that being in a straight relationship gives her certain privileges but then expects her to have LGBT community support. However, the girlfriend isn't asking for privileges; she's asserting her identity. The author's stance might be rooted in insecurity, thinking she's not loyal if she participates in Pride. But attending Pride is about solidarity and pride in her identity, not about being unfaithful.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that her emotional needs are significant here. She feels her identity is under attack. The author might not be considering that her participation in Pride is important for her sense of self and community. The argument could be that the author is not respecting her right to maintain her identity beyond their relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being bisexual is a valid identity, and attending Pride events is a way to celebrate and support that identity. The author's discomfort might stem from a lack of understanding of bisexuality. The key is whether the author is respecting his girlfriend's identity. If he's making her choose between her identity and their relationship, that's a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's invalidating his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity. His argument is based on a misunderstanding of what bisexuality entails. The girlfriend's actions are about her identity and support for the community, not about the relationship itself. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
