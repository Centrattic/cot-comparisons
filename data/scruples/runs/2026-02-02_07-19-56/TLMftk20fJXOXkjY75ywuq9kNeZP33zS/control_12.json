I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend gay pride events. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author isn't homophobic. He supports people being themselves. His girlfriend is bi, was in a previous same-sex relationship, but now is in a heterosexual relationship with him. Every year, she goes to pride with friends. He argues that since she's now in a hetero relationship, she's not part of the LGBT community anymore and feels she's erasing their relationship by going to pride. She's upset, says she's still bi, part of the community, and needs to support the cause. She's left, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about identity and community. The author's main issue is that she's in a straight relationship now but still participates in pride events. He compares it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and he went to straight pride events. He feels it's erasing their relationship by her being part of another community.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend identifies as bi. Being bisexual means she's attracted to both genders. Her sexual orientation isn't defined by her current relationship. So even though she's with a guy now, she's still part of the LGBT community. Pride events are for the entire community, including bisexual people. The author's argument that she's not part of the community because she's currently in a heterosexual relationship might be invalid. It's her identity, not her current relationship status that defines that.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend feels she's been outcast by both straight and LGBT communities. She uses pride as a way to connect with her identity. The author's insistence that she should not attend might be dismissing her identity. The comparison he makes to straight bars might not hold because pride is about the entire community, not just those in same-sex relationships. If she's part of the community, attending pride is her way of expressing pride in who she is.\n\nThe author's insecurity might be playing a role here. He's worried about her being around other women and feeling she's not fully committed to their relationship. But the girlfriend has stated she's faithful and supports the community. His reaction could be projecting his insecurities onto her, making this more about his comfort than her rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. He might feel like his relationship isn't acknowledged if she's at pride. But his perspective might not consider that bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT community regardless of current relationship status. The girlfriend's participation in pride is about her identity, not about the relationship.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the author's stance could be seen as dismissing his girlfriend's identity and needs. By not supporting her in attending pride, he's not respecting her as a bi person. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling erased, which is a significant emotional response. The author's argument that she can't have both the straight community's privileges and the LGBT community's support might be a false dichotomy. People can be part of multiple communities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. He's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in events that affirm her sexuality. The answer should be A.\n"
