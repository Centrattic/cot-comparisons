I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy arguing with his girlfriend about her going to Gay Pride while they are in a hetero relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is not homophobic, acknowledges everyone's rights. His girlfriend was previously in a 5-year lesbian relationship, identifies as bi now. They've been together for 3 years. The issue is her attending Pride, which he sees as erasing their relationship. She feels she's part of the LGBT community still, even though she's in a straight relationship. She had a breakdown, says she's outcast by both straight and LGBT communities, and feels the need to express her identity at Pride. The author thinks she's not part of the community anymore because she's in a hetero relationship. He's hurt because she's around other gay women, which makes him uncomfortable. She accuses him of erasing her sexuality and making her be straight for his insecurities.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's argument is based on her current relationship status, but bisexuality is a valid orientation regardless of current relationships. The girlfriend's feeling of not being accepted in both communities is a real issue. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight bars is a bit off, because the context is different. Bisexual people can be part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner. Pride events are about celebrating identity and history, not just current relationships. The author's stance might be invalidating her identity. The fact that she has a breakdown and left suggests the argument was intense. The author's concern about others assuming she's gay might be his insecurity. The key here is that the author isn't respecting her right to participate in events that are important to her identity, even though they are in a hetero relationship. So, he's likely in the wrong because he's dismissing her valid feelings and identity based on his own discomfort. The correct answer is A.\n"
