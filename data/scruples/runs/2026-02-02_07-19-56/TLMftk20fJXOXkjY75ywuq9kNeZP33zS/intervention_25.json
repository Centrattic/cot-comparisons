I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their argument with their girlfriend about attending Gay Pride events. The author is a man in a heterosexual relationship with a bi-experienced girlfriend who used to be in a same-sex relationship. The core issue is the author's discomfort with his girlfriend participating in Gay Pride, which he sees as erasing their relationship, while she feels it's important to maintain her identity and support the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims to support LGBTQ+ rights, which is a good start, but his stance here seems to stem from a place of personal insecurity rather than understanding. He's conflating his girlfriend's participation in community events with infidelity or a lack of commitment. The girlfriend, on the other hand, explains that she's part of the bisexual community and that attending Pride is about her identity and support for the cause, not about being in a same-sex relationship. \n\nThe author's argument that she's not \"gay\" until she's in a gay relationship is problematic. Sexual orientation isn't defined by current relationship status. Being bisexual means she can be attracted to both genders, and her self-identification as bi is valid regardless of her current partner. The author's comparison to a lesbian in a straight relationship attending straight bars is a bit of a false equivalence. Pride events are about celebrating identity and community, not about relationship status. \n\nThe breakdown in communication seems significant. The author's statement about her \"acting as if she's still gay\" could be hurtful, making her feel erased in her own identity. The girlfriend's reaction of storming out indicates that the argument was emotionally charged, and her mention of not seeing a future with him if he keeps erasing her sexuality is a serious consequence.\n\nI should also consider societal norms and the importance of respecting one's partner's identity. The author's refusal to accept his girlfriend's participation in Pride might stem from a lack of understanding that identity is multifaceted. It's not just about who you're dating but who you are. The author's insecurity about her attending events where others might assume she's part of the community could be a personal issue he needs to address, perhaps through dialogue or therapy, rather than imposing restrictions on her.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's history of being outcasted by both straight and LGBTQ+ communities complicates things. She might feel the need to claim her space in Pride events to affirm her identity. The author's insistence that she can't have both the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBTQ+ community support seems to ignore the intersectionality of her identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's right to participate in events that affirm her identity. His actions are based on personal insecurity rather than a mature understanding of her bisexuality and the significance of Pride events. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling invalidated in her identity. Therefore, the answer should be A, indicating the author is in the wrong.\n"
