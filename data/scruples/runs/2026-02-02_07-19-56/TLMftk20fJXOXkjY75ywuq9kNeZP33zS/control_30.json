I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is the asshole (AITA) for not wanting his girlfriend to go to gay pride.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who used to be in a same-sex relationship. She identifies as bisexual now and wants to attend Pride events. The author is uncomfortable with this because he feels it erases their current relationship and that she's acting as if she's still gay. He mentioned that he's not homophobic, just conflicted about her participation given their current relationship status. \n\nThe girlfriend had an emotional breakdown, indicating that the author's comments hurt her. She feels that he's invalidating her sexuality and making her \"be straight\" for his insecurities. She argues that her bisexuality doesn't disappear just because she's in a heterosexual relationship, and she needs Pride for community support and expression. \n\nFrom a general perspective, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Her participation in Pride events is about solidarity and community, not about being in a same-sex relationship currently. The author's concern might stem from insecurity or fear of her rekindling past connections, but it's important to recognize that her identity is her own. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting her identity and the fact that Pride is for the entire LGBTQ+ community, including bisexual individuals. The author's stance might be projecting his insecurities onto her, making him question her commitment or her true identity. However, his girlfriend's feelings of being erased or not accepted in either community are significant. \n\nThe argument here is whether the author is overstepping by dictating her participation in events that are important to her identity. Since the author is not part of the LGBTQ+ community, he might be struggling with understanding the importance of Pride for his bisexual partner. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that his comments were hurtful and dismissive of her identity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in a position where he needs to respect his partner's identity and her choice to engage with the community that supports her. His discomfort shouldn't override her need to express her identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for invalidating her bisexuality and the importance of Pride events to her.\n"
