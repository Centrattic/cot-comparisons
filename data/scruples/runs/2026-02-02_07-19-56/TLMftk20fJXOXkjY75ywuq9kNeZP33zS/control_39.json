I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend is bisexual, has been in a same-sex relationship before, and now is in a heterosexual one with the author. The issue is that the author doesn't want her to attend Gay Pride events, feeling it erases their relationship. The girlfriend is upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author feels that since their girlfriend is now in a hetero relationship, going to Gay Pride is inappropriate and makes it seem like she's still gay. The girlfriend argues that she's still part of the LGBT community as a bi person and wants to support the community and express her identity. \n\nBi people often face a lot of erasure and stigma. Being part of the LGBT community isn't solely about current relationships but about identity. The author's argument that she isn't \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" seems to misunderstand bisexuality. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation regardless of current partner. The author is asking her to suppress part of her identity to accommodate his feelings, which is a form of erasure.\n\nThe author might be experiencing insecurity or jealousy, but it's important to respect the girlfriend's identity. The fact that the girlfriend has a history in the community and feels a need to connect with it shouldn't be dismissed. Also, the author's comparison to a female couple going to straight bars isn't quite parallel because the experience of being in a marginalized community is different. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality and the community's significance to her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is about her identity being attacked. The author's refusal to acknowledge her as part of the LGBT community despite her bisexuality is problematic. It's about her right to express her identity and support her community. The argument that she can't have the privileges of a straight relationship while supporting the LGBT community is flawed because she's not denying her relationship status but is asserting her identity.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not respecting the girlfriend's identity and the importance of the community to her. The girlfriend's need to participate in Pride is about self-expression and support, which is valid. The author's stance might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't justify invalidating her bisexuality. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong, which is option A.\n"
