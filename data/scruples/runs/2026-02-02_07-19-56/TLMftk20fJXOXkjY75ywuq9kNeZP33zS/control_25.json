I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup over their girlfriend going to Gay Pride. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author isn't homophobic, but he's uncomfortable with his girlfriend attending Gay Pride because she's in a heterosexual relationship now. He argues that since she's not in a same-sex relationship anymore, she shouldn't participate in Pride events, and he feels it erases their relationship. The girlfriend, however, identifies as bisexual and feels a connection to the LGBTQ+ community despite being in a straight relationship. She's upset that he's invalidating her identity.\n\nSo, the key points are about identity and community participation. The author is making assumptions about what bisexuality entails. Bisexuality means attraction to both genders, so being in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate that identity. The author's argument that she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" is flawed because bisexuality isn't defined by current relationships. \n\nThe girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity and supporting the community, which is a personal choice. The author is projecting his insecurities onto her, suggesting that her attending Pride means she's not fully committed to their relationship. That's a form of control and doesn't respect her right to maintain her identity and community ties.\n\nMoreover, the author is denying her the support of both communities. The girlfriend mentions feeling excluded by both straight and LGBTQ+ communities, which is a real experience for some bisexual people. By not allowing her to participate in Pride, the author is contributing to that erasure, which is harmful.\n\nThe breakdown of the relationship seems to stem from the author's inability to accept his girlfriend's bisexuality in its entirety. The argument that if he were in a same-sex relationship and his partner went to straight events, it would be the same, ignores the context. The issue here is about identity, not about the relationship itself. The author is conflating participation in a community event with infidelity or disloyalty, which isn't valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is based on misunderstanding bisexuality and not respecting his girlfriend's right to express her identity. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
