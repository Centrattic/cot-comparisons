I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who previously was in a 5-year relationship with a woman. She identifies as bisexual, having dated both women and now a man. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with friends, some of whom are gay and others straight. The author is uncomfortable with this because she's in a hetero relationship now and he feels she's \"erasing\" their relationship by attending events associated with the LGBT community. \n\nThe key points here are about identity and community. The author argues that since she's in a hetero relationship and not dating women anymore, she doesn't belong to the LGBT community anymore. But the girlfriend argues that bisexuality is part of her identity, and Pride is a time for her to celebrate that part of herself. She also mentions feeling like she's not accepted by either community now\u2014cast out by straight people because of her past and not fully accepted by the LGBT community now that she's in a hetero relationship.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is that he feels her participation in Pride erases their relationship, but the girlfriend sees it as important for her identity. The author also compares it to a lesbian in a relationship going to straight bars, which might not be a perfect analogy since bisexuality is a different orientation. The author's stance might be rooted in insecurity or feeling that her presence at Pride undermines their relationship. \n\nNow, considering the broader context: Bisexual people can still be part of the LGBT community even if they're in a hetero relationship. Identity isn't solely based on current relationships. Pride events are about celebrating queer identities and history, which is important for many people regardless of their current relationship status. The author's argument that she can't belong to both communities might be invalidating her identity. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her. The author's comment about \"protecting his insecurities\" could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author might be projecting his discomfort onto her actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not respecting her identity and the importance of Pride to her. By not supporting her participation in an event that's meaningful to her, he's contributing to her feeling erased, which is the opposite of what he claims to avoid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here."
