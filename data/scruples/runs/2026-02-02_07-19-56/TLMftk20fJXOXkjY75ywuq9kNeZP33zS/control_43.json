I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is the author's girlfriend going to Gay Pride while they're in a heterosexual relationship. The author feels it's erasing their relationship, right? They mention that she used to be in a same-sex relationship but now is with him, and he's uncomfortable with her participating in Pride events.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She identifies as bisexual, which means she's not exclusively gay. She explains that going to Pride is about her identity and supporting the community, not just her current relationship status. She also mentions feeling outcasted by both straight and LGBT communities, which adds to her need to express her identity.\n\nThe author argues that since she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't partake in Gay Pride because it's not part of her current identity. But bisexuality is a valid orientation regardless of current relationship status. The author's stance might be minimizing her identity. Also, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014storming out and not wanting a future with him if he keeps \"erasing\" her sexuality\u2014shows how hurt she feels by his words.\n\nThe author's analogy about a lesbian girlfriend going to straight bars doesn't quite hold because Pride events are about celebrating identity, not seeking new relationships. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or not fully understanding that identity isn't defined by current relationships. Supporting Pride events is about solidarity with the community, which she still is part of due to her bisexuality.\n\nSo, the author is making the relationship about his insecurities and not respecting her identity and her need to connect with the community. That seems to be the crux. The girlfriend is standing up for her identity, which is a valid stance. The author's actions and words are dismissing her identity, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
