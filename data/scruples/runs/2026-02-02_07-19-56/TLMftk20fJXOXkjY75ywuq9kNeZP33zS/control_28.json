I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with their girlfriend, who previously was in a five-year relationship with a woman and identifies as bisexual. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with friends, both gay and straight. The author feels that since she's now in a straight relationship, attending Pride is erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that the author is invalidating her bisexuality and making her \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings vs. the girlfriend's identity. The author argues that attending Pride when in a straight relationship is confusing, while the girlfriend sees it as a way to support the community and express her pride in her identity, which includes being bisexual.\n\nNow, I need to consider the broader context. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Being in a current relationship with a person of the opposite gender doesn't negate that. The girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity, not her current relationship status. The author's concern seems to stem from a place of insecurity or fear that her presence at Pride might imply that she's not fully committed to their relationship. However, the girlfriend has clarified she's not looking elsewhere and is committed.\n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBT community's support is problematic. It suggests that once someone is in a straight relationship, they lose their connection to the community they were part of before. That's not accurate. Sexual orientation is part of one's identity and doesn't change based on relationship status. People can support causes and communities related to their identity regardless of who they're currently dating.\n\nThe author's comparison to a lesbian in a straight bar also has issues. The context matters. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, which includes bisexual individuals. There's a difference between attending an event that celebrates one's identity and attending an event that's the opposite. The author's discomfort might be rooted in jealousy or a lack of understanding of bisexuality. \n\nThe girlfriend feels erased because her sexuality is being questioned. The author is essentially telling her that her identity is only valid if she's in a same-sex relationship, which is not the case. Bisexual people don't need to be in same-sex relationships to be part of the LGBT community. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that \"she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship\" is incorrect. Sexual orientation is about attraction, not relationship status. Being bisexual means she is attracted to both genders, and that doesn't change based on who she's dating. So, the author is invalidating her identity and the community's inclusivity.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach might have been too confrontational, leading to the girlfriend's breakdown. However, the underlying issue is the author's stance on her participation in Pride, which is based on a misunderstanding of her identity. \n\nGiven all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they're dismissing their girlfriend's valid identity and the importance of her community to her. The author's concerns, while understandable, are based on a lack of understanding of bisexuality and the role of Pride events. The girlfriend's right to express her identity and support the community should be respected, regardless of her current relationship status."
