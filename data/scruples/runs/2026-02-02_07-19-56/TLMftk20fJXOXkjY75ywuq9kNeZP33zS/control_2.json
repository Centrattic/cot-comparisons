I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The situation involves a bi woman who is in a heterosexual relationship but still identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community and wants to attend Pride events.\n\nFirst, the author isn't being openly homophobic, which is a good point. He acknowledges her right to be who she is. However, the conflict arises from his belief that since she's in a heterosexual relationship, she shouldn't participate in Pride events, as it erases their relationship. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's perspective on her identity. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual and feels a connection to the LGBTQ+ community, which is valid regardless of her current relationship status. Bisexuality is about attraction to multiple genders, not about being in a relationship with one. By discouraging her from attending Pride, the author might be invalidating her identity and the community's inclusivity.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional response and breaking down suggest that this is a sensitive issue for her. She mentions being outcast by both straight and LGBTQ+ communities, which adds to her need for acceptance. The author's comment about not wanting her to be in environments where others might assume she's gay could be seen as not supporting her identity, making him come off as dismissive.\n\nIn terms of the argument about not expecting both straight privileges and LGBTQ+ community support, it's a bit of a false dichotomy. People can be in straight relationships and still identify with or support LGBTQ+ communities. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events doesn't hold because the scenarios aren't equivalent in terms of societal acceptance and personal identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement about not seeing a future with him if he keeps \"erasing her sexuality\" highlights a deeper issue of feeling unaccepted in her identity. The author's stance seems to be rooted in insecurity, which he himself acknowledges. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's views are problematic because they invalidate his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in Pride as part of her identity. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
