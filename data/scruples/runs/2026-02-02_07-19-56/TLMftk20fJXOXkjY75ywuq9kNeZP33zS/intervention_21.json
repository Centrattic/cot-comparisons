I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy being upset that his girlfriend, who identified as gay but is now in a heterosexual relationship, still attends Gay Pride events. He's struggling with her participation because he feels it erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. She's bisexual and feels her identity is still part of the LGBT community, even though she's with a guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. The right to attend such events is protected. The girlfriend's participation isn't about her current relationship but her identity. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, so her support for the community is legitimate. The author's issue is more about his feelings of insecurity and not wanting to share his partner with a community he perceives as separate.\n\nHe mentions that he's not homophobic, which is good. But his argument is that since she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't partake in the LGBT community's events. This might be erasing her bisexuality. The key here is that bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status. Just because she's dating a man now doesn't mean she can't support the community she's part of.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this is a deep emotional issue for her. She's trying to maintain her identity even within a straight relationship. The author's analogy about a lesbian girlfriend attending straight bars might not hold because the contexts are different. Straight bars aren't about identity as much as Gay Pride is. Also, attending Gay Pride is about supporting a community, not about seeking relationships.\n\nThe author's statement about not wanting his girlfriend to access both communities could be seen as trying to control her identity. The girlfriend's response about future compatibility is valid if he's unwilling to accept her bisexuality. The author is conflating her support for the community with infidelity or her not being fully committed. That's a misstep. He should respect her identity regardless of her current relationship status.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is based on personal discomfort rather than any wrongdoing by his girlfriend. Her participation in Gay Pride is a personal right and a part of her identity. The author needs to work on accepting her bisexuality and her right to support the community. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
