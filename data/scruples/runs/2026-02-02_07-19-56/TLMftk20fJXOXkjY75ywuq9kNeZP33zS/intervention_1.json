I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to go to Gay Pride even though she's in a heterosexual relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't homophobic, which is important. The girlfriend identifies as bi and has been out of a same-sex relationship. The main conflict is the author feeling that her attending Pride erases their relationship, as if she's still gay. The girlfriend feels that the author is invalidating her identity and that she's part of the LGBT community regardless of her current relationship status.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that since she's in a hetero relationship and not dating women anymore, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community events. But the girlfriend argues that being bi means she's still part of that community and wants to support it. The author also uses an analogy about a female couple going to straight bars, which might not be the best analogy here.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of bisexuality. Bisexual people can be in any relationship type but still identify as part of the LGBT community. The idea that one must be in a same-sex relationship to be part of the community is a misconception. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto her, as the girlfriend mentioned the author's insecurities. Also, the girlfriend's emotional response suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her\u2014feeling accepted is crucial for her.\n\nThe author's stance could be seen as gatekeeping the LGBT community, which is generally frowned upon. People in the LGBT community often support each other regardless of their current relationship status. The author's argument that she can't have the privileges of both worlds (straight relationship and LGBT community) might be dismissive of her ongoing identity as bi. The girlfriend's need to express her pride and support the community is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of hurt and insecurity are real too, but the way he's expressing them might be invalidating her identity. The breakdown in communication led to a serious argument, which indicates that his approach might be harmful. The girlfriend's statement about not seeing a future with him if he keeps erasing her sexuality points to a deeper issue in their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. He's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and is making it about his insecurities rather than her right to identify as bi and participate in the community. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
