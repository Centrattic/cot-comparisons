I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that his girlfriend, who used to be in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual, wants to attend Gay Pride events while they're in a heterosexual relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author isn't homophobic and supports people being who they are, but he's uncomfortable because his girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship yet still wants to participate in Gay Pride. He feels like she's erasing their relationship by going to these events. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees herself as bisexual and feels a connection to the LGBTQ+ community, especially given her past. She also mentions feeling caught between two worlds and needing the event to express her identity. She's upset that her partner doesn't understand her need to be part of that community.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship but still wants to engage with the LGBTQ+ community. He compares it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and went to straight events. The girlfriend argues that bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum and that she still feels part of that community regardless of her current relationship status.\n\nI should recall that bisexuality is a recognized orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Even if she's in a heterosexual relationship now, her identity as bisexual doesn't change. The community events like Gay Pride are about celebrating identity and solidarity, not just current relationship status. The author's concern about her attending might stem from jealousy or insecurity, thinking she's not fully committed to their relationship. However, the girlfriend's need to participate is about her personal identity and support for the community, not about the relationship itself.\n\nThe argument here is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. The author's stance seems to invalidate his girlfriend's bisexuality by suggesting she can't be part of the LGBTQ+ community unless she's in a same-sex relationship. That's a misrepresentation of what bisexuality entails. The girlfriend's participation in Pride events is about her identity, not her current partner's feelings. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't quite the same because heterosexuality and LGBTQ+ identities are different contexts. Also, the author's statement that she's not gay until she's in a gay relationship is incorrect because bisexuality includes attraction to both genders, and being in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality.\n\nMoreover, the author's reaction led the girlfriend to have a breakdown and leave, which indicates that his words were hurtful. The fact that she's passionate about the cause and feels a need to express her pride is a legitimate aspect of her identity. The author's inability to support her in this aspect of her life could be seen as dismissive of her identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's invalidating his girlfriend's bisexual identity and the importance of community events to her. His argument is based on a misunderstanding of what bisexuality entails and the role of such events in the LGBTQ+ community.\n"
