I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to go to Gay Pride, and the author is upset about that. \n\nFirst, the author states they're not homophobic, which is a good starting point. The girlfriend identified as gay in her previous relationship but now is in a heterosexual relationship with the author. She says she's bisexual, as she's never been into guys before him. The author's issue is that she's going to Pride when she's in a straight relationship, which he feels erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's part of the LGBT community (as a bi person) and wants to support the cause. The author is comparing it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and he went to straight events, implying that it's a two-way street. But wait, the girlfriend is part of the LGBT community as a bisexual person, regardless of her current relationship status. Bisexual people are part of the community even if they're in a straight or same-sex relationship. So, the author might be misunderstanding that.\n\nThe author argues that she can't have the privileges of a straight relationship and the LGBT community at the same time. But that's a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities or identities without contradiction. Also, the girlfriend's presence at Pride is about supporting the cause and her identity, not being unfaithful or undermining the relationship. \n\nThe author's comparison to straight bars and Pride events isn't quite the same. If the girlfriend were in a same-sex relationship, attending straight pride might be different, but here she's asserting her bi identity. The author's main issue seems to be insecurity or feeling that her participation in Pride diminishes their relationship. However, supporting one's partner's identity, even if it overlaps with their past, is important.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and saying she can't see a future with him if he keeps erasing her sexuality is serious. The author's stance might be invalidating her identity. The key here is that bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT community, and her attending Pride is about her identity and support for the community, not about her current relationship. The author is possibly being exclusionary and not respecting her identity beyond her current relationship status. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
