I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is a guy in a three-year relationship with his girlfriend. She previously was in a five-year relationship with a woman, identifying as gay. Now she's in a heterosexual relationship but still goes to Gay Pride every year. The author is uncomfortable with this because he feels it erases their relationship and that she's acting as if she's still gay. They had a big argument about this, and she left, saying she can't see a future with him if he keeps \"erasing her sexuality.\" The author is confused because he supports the LGBT community but finds it hurtful that his girlfriend wants to participate in Pride events. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is whether the author's feelings are valid. He's not homophobic, but he's concerned about his girlfriend attending Pride while in a straight relationship. He compares it to if his girlfriend, who is now in a heterosexual relationship, went to straight bars and straight pride events, which he wouldn't like. But he's not making that comparison directly in the situation. Wait, he does mention that scenario as a hypothetical. So he's using that to explain his feelings.\n\nNow, the girlfriend identifies as bisexual. She's in a relationship with a man but still identifies as part of the LGBT community. She's part of a group where some are gay, some straight. The author is arguing that since she's in a straight relationship now, she's not part of the LGBT community and shouldn't attend Pride events. However, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and people can be part of the LGBT community regardless of their current relationship status. So, the author might be misunderstanding the nature of bisexuality and the community's acceptance of it.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of sexual orientation and community inclusion. Being in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate someone's bisexuality. The LGBT community includes people of various orientations, including bisexuals. So the author is possibly making a mistake in assuming that attendance at Pride events is only for those currently in same-sex relationships. That's a common misconception, but incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that this is about her identity and feeling accepted. She's had past experiences where she was outcast by both the straight and LGBT communities. The author's stance might be making her feel like her identity is being questioned or erased, which is a serious issue in relationships. It's important to respect a partner's identity, even if it's different from your own expectations.\n\nThe author's comparison to a hypothetical situation where his girlfriend goes to straight bars and events might not hold because the context of Pride is different. Pride is about celebrating identity and community, not exclusively about current relationship status. Also, the author is in a heterosexual relationship, which gives him certain privileges, but he's not making the same request of his girlfriend as he is of himself.\n\nAnother angle is about consent and mutual respect in relationships. The author is expressing his feelings, but the issue is whether his feelings justify the control he's exerting over his girlfriend's participation in her community. Relationships require compromise, but this seems more about respecting her identity versus his insecurities. The author might be projecting his own discomfort onto his girlfriend's identity, which isn't fair.\n\nThe breakdown of the argument and her storming out indicates that this is a significant issue for both parties. The author's statement about not wanting her to attend Pride because she's \"acting as if she's still gay\" might come across as invalidating her bisexuality. It's possible that the author is conflating bisexuality with being gay, not recognizing that bisexuality is its own valid orientation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance appears to stem from a lack of understanding about bisexuality and the broader LGBT community. His actions could be seen as erasing his girlfriend's identity, which is a serious issue in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
