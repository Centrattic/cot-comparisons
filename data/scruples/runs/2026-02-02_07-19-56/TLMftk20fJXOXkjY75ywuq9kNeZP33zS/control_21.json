I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both perspectives carefully.\n\nFirst, the author isn't homophobic and acknowledges the importance of LGBTQ+ rights. His main issue is that his girlfriend identifies as bi but is in a heterosexual relationship. He feels that attending Pride events erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. He's concerned about her being around other gay women who might assume she's gay, which makes him uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels that her identity as a bi person isn't erased by being in a relationship with a man. She values Pride as a way to support the community and express her identity, which has historical significance for her. She's been outcast by both straight and LGBTQ+ communities before, so attending Pride is important for her sense of belonging. Her breakdown suggests that his comments hurt her deeply, making her feel pressured to be \"straight\" to fit his insecurities.\n\nThe key points here are about personal identity and validation. The author's stance might stem from insecurity or fear of not being fully accepted in her community. However, bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status. The girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity and support for the community, not about being in a relationship. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't quite parallel because being part of the LGBTQ+ community isn't contingent on relationship status, whereas straight individuals don't face the same historical stigma or need for specific community events.\n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both straight privileges and LGBTQ+ community support might be oversimplifying her identity. It's possible to be in a heterosexual relationship and still support LGBTQ+ causes. The hurtful impact of his words on his girlfriend is significant, leading her to question their future together. This suggests that his approach was dismissive of her feelings and identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions stem from personal insecurity and a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the significance of Pride events. His comments invalidated his girlfriend's identity and caused emotional distress. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
