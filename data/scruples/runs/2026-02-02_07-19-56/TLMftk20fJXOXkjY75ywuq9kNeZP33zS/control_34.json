I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She previously dated women and now is with the author. Every year, she goes to Gay Pride with friends, both gay and straight. The author feels that since she's in a straight relationship now, she shouldn't participate in Gay Pride because it erases their relationship. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that the author is invalidating her identity as a bisexual person who still supports the LGBT community.\n\nThe author's main argument is that attending Pride as a hetero couple member isn't appropriate. They mention the analogy of a lesbian going to straight events, which the girlfriend might find offensive. However, the girlfriend argues that bisexuality is part of her identity regardless of her current relationship. She also mentions that she's part of a community that has faced marginalization and wants to support it.\n\nNow, considering the broader context. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. Being in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate that. The author's stance might stem from insecurity or a lack of understanding about bisexuality. The girlfriend's perspective is about self-expression and solidarity with the LGBT community, which she's part of. Her attendance at Pride is about her identity, not her current relationship status.\n\nAlso, the author's comparison to a lesbian attending straight events is flawed. The lesbian's identity isn't erased by attending straight events, but the author's argument here might be based on a false equivalence. The key difference is that the author's girlfriend identifies as part of the LGBT community (bisexual), so her participation is part of her identity. The author's discomfort might stem from not recognizing that her identity isn't solely defined by her current relationship.\n\nThe author's actions led to a breakdown in communication and emotional distress. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the author's words were hurtful and invalidated her identity. The author might not be considering that supporting Pride isn't about being in a specific relationship but about being part of a community. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems that they are not respecting their partner's identity. The girlfriend's bisexuality is a core part of who she is, and attending Pride is her way of expressing pride in that. The author's argument that she isn't \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" is incorrect, as bisexuality is an identity regardless of relationship status. \n\nFurthermore, the author is projecting their own insecurities onto their partner. By trying to control her participation in a community she's part of, the author is undermining her autonomy and the importance of that community to her. This can be seen as a form of erasure, which is harmful and disrespectful.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are not supporting their partner's identity and are making her choose between her community and their relationship, which is unfair and hurtful.\n"
