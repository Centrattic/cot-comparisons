I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author is right to not want his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, was previously in a same-sex relationship, and now is in a heterosexual one with the author. She wants to go to Pride events again, but the author feels it's erasing their relationship and that she's not part of the LGBT community anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's bisexual, which is part of the LGBT+ community. Even if she's in a straight relationship now, her identity doesn't change. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the entire LGBT+ community, including bisexual people. The girlfriend mentions feeling ostracized by both straight and LGBT communities, so for her, Pride is a way to feel included and support her identity. The author's argument that she can't have the privileges of both communities might be invalidating her identity. \n\nThen, the author's perspective is about feeling that her attending Pride might imply she's still gay, which could make him uncomfortable. But he's also expressing insecurity, especially since he can't relate to a hypothetical where a female partner goes to straight pride events. However, the key here is that the girlfriend's participation in Pride doesn't necessarily mean she's not committed to their relationship. The author seems to be conflating her identity with her actions in the relationship. Just because someone is in a straight relationship doesn't mean they can't support their own community.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was a breakdown, which indicates deep emotional impact. The author's comments about \"erasing her sexuality\" and making her \"be straight\" might be seen as dismissive of her bisexuality. The author's stance that she's only gay if she's in a same-sex relationship is not accurate\u2014bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's viewpoint is based on his own insecurities and a misunderstanding of bisexuality. The girlfriend's right to be part of the community she identifies with isn't erased by her being in a straight relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here for not respecting her identity and the importance of Pride to her.\n"
