I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. The author identifies as not homophobic, but he's uncomfortable because his girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship now. He argues that since she's with him, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore.\n\nFirst, it's important to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She was in a 5-year relationship with a woman and identifies as bi. Even though she's now in a heterosexual relationship, her sexuality isn't changing. The author seems to think that being in a straight relationship makes her straight, but bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, not just acting on it. So, her identity as bi isn't contingent on her current relationship status.\n\nThe author's main issue is that attending Pride feels like it's erasing their relationship. He's drawing parallels to a same-sex couple going to straight events, which might be a bit of a flawed comparison. The key here is that the girlfriend is still part of the bi community, and Pride events are for the entire LGBT community, not just gay people. So, attending Pride is about solidarity and support for the community, not about her current relationship status.\n\nThe author's discomfort might stem from insecurity. He's questioning whether his girlfriend's presence at Pride is a way of still exploring her sexuality, even though she says she's faithful. It's possible he's projecting his own insecurities onto her actions. Also, he's suggesting she should be \"straight\" in their relationship, which could be invalidating her identity. Bisexual people don't need to choose one identity over another based on their current partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and her statement about not seeing a future with him if he keeps erasing her sexuality are significant. It shows how deeply this issue affects her. The author's stance might be causing emotional harm. Pride events are about celebrating identity and community, and denying that can feel like rejection to her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's feelings are valid, his reasoning might be based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the purpose of Pride. The girlfriend has the right to participate in events that affirm her identity, especially since the community includes bisexual people. The author's argument that she isn't part of the LGBT community because she's in a straight relationship is incorrect. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because he's invalidating her identity and causing conflict based on his own insecurities rather than respecting her autonomy and identity.\n"
