I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, having been in a previous same-sex relationship but now in a hetero relationship. The author's main issue is that since she's in a straight relationship now, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community, hence attending Pride. The girlfriend feels this is erasing her bisexuality and that she needs to be part of the community for support and solidarity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Bisexual individuals are part of the LGBT community, right? So even if she's in a hetero relationship now, her sexuality isn't defined solely by her current relationship status. The author seems to think that only people in same-sex relationships are part of the LGBT community, which might be a misunderstanding. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and people can be part of the community regardless of their current partner's gender. \n\nThe author's argument is that by attending Pride, she's being inconsistent, as if she's claiming privileges from both the straight and LGBT communities. But that's a bit of a false dichotomy. People can be part of multiple communities or have intersecting identities. The author's comparison to a gay woman going to straight bars is a bit off because being in a straight relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality, just like being in a same-sex relationship doesn't make someone exclusively gay. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentions she's been ostracized by both communities before. The author's stance could be causing her emotional distress, making her feel that her identity is being invalidated. That's a big deal. The author might be projecting their own insecurities onto her, as he mentions \"protect my insecurities.\" Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's identities and needs. If the author can't support her in expressing her identity, that could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't opposed to the LGBT community, as he states he supports Gay Pride. His issue is specifically with his girlfriend's participation. But why would her attending Pride erase their relationship? They can both support the cause without it affecting their relationship's validity. The author's belief that she has to \"choose\" which community to be part of is problematic. \n\nThe key here is understanding bisexuality and the importance of community for many people. The author's refusal to acknowledge her continued membership in the LGBT community could be invalidating her identity, which is a form of erasure. The girlfriend's need to attend Pride for solidarity and to celebrate her identity is valid. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting her identity and the community she's part of, despite their current relationship status.\n"
