I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a bi woman who is going to Pride events again. He's uncomfortable because she's in a hetero relationship now but still identifies as bi and wants to support the community. She had a breakdown over this, saying he's erasing her identity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which is part of the LGBT+ community. Even if she's in a heterosexual relationship, her identity isn't erased. Bisexuality is about attraction to more than one gender, not about current relationship status. So, the author might be conflating her identity with her current partner. The girlfriend is going to Pride to celebrate her identity and support the community, which is valid regardless of her current relationship.\n\nThe author's concern seems to be about her participating in a community that he feels contradicts their relationship. But the girlfriend is part of that community by her identity. He's not wrong in feeling that she's part of the LGBT+ community, but his objection is based on her relationship status, which doesn't negate her identity. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important here. She's experienced being in both communities and feels a loss of belonging. The author's comment about her \"acting as if she's still gay\" might dismiss her identity. Also, he's comparing it to a female couple going to straight events, but that's different because bisexuality is part of the LGBT+ umbrella. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions.\n\nIn terms of support, the girlfriend is expressing that she needs to participate in Pride for her sense of self. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her identity, which might contribute to the argument. The line about \"privileges of a straight relationship\" is a bit confusing\u2014Pride events are about community and support, not about privileges. The author's refusal to support her participation could be seen as undermining her identity.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing his feelings of being hurt and confused. He's trying to navigate his own comfort with her participation. But the key point is that her identity isn't dependent on her relationship status. The girlfriend has the right to celebrate her identity, and the author's objection might stem from a place of insecurity rather than a valid concern about her actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because he's dismissing his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in events that are important to her, based on her current relationship status rather than her actual identity. The girlfriend's participation doesn't erase their relationship but rather affirms her place in the community she's part of.\n"
