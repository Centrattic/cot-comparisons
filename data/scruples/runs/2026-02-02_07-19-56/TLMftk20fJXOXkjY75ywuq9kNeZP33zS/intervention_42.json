I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride, even though she identifies as bi. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he's not homophobic and supports everyone's right to be themselves. But he's uncomfortable because his girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship now and he feels that going to Pride erases their relationship. He argues that since she's not in a same-sex relationship, she's not part of the LGBT community anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a breakdown and feels erased. She mentions being outcast by both straight and LGBT communities. She identifies as bi and supports the cause, wanting to be part of Pride for the community's history and her own identity. She argues that her sexuality isn't just about her current relationship and that she's still part of the community.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he sees her participation in Pride as conflicting with their relationship. He compares it to a same-sex couple going to straight events, which he wouldn't like. But the key here is understanding bisexuality. Being bi means attraction to more than one gender, not just being in a relationship with one. So even if she's in a hetero relationship, her identity isn't erased.\n\nThe author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions. He's concerned about her being around other women who might assume she's gay, but he hasn't considered that her participation is about her identity, not her current relationship. The girlfriend's need to express her identity and support the community is valid. \n\nAlso, the comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight events isn't perfect. In that case, the couple's identity is fixed, whereas the girlfriend's bisexuality is a part of her that doesn't change based on her relationship status. The author's expectation that she should conform to straight norms because of their relationship is problematic.\n\nHe's trying to impose his comfort on her identity, which isn't fair. People in relationships can still have other aspects of their identity. The girlfriend is being true to herself, which is important for her mental health and authenticity. The author's refusal to accept this could lead to more issues in their relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's identity and for making her feel like she has to hide part of herself in their relationship. His insecurity is causing him to dismiss her valid feelings and experiences.\n"
