I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She went to Gay Pride with her friends, which the author feels is erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. The girlfriend had a breakdown and left because he mentioned this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't homophobic, which is good, but his issue is more about the girlfriend's participation in Pride events despite being in a straight relationship. The girlfriend argues that she still identifies as bi and feels a connection to the LGBT community, especially since she was outcasted before. The author feels like she's not fully part of the community now because she's in a straight relationship, but he supports Pride in general.\n\nFrom a bisexual perspective, bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status. The girlfriend's participation in Pride could be about her personal identity and support for the community, not just her current relationship. The author's concern might stem from insecurity or feeling that her presence at Pride undermines their relationship. However, it's important to recognize that bisexuality isn't exclusive. She can be in a straight relationship and still identify as bi. \n\nThe author's comparison to a lesbian in a straight relationship going to straight bars is flawed because bisexuality includes attraction to both genders, so attending Pride is a way to support her community. The author's insistence that she can't have privileges from both communities might overlook the reality that bisexuality is a bridge between straight and LGBT communities. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that this issue is emotionally significant to her. The author's approach of expressing his feelings directly but without considering her perspective might have been too harsh. Communication is key here. Instead of framing it as being \"in the wrong,\" it's about understanding mutual needs. The author's stance could be seen as invalidating her identity, which is a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her identity and the importance she places on her community. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there are other angles. Maybe the author is justified if he feels disrespected, but generally, respecting a partner's identity is crucial. So the answer is A.\n"
