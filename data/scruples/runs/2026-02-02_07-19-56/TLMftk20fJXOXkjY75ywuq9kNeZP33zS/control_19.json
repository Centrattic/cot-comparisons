I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The author identifies as not homophobic and supports LGBTQ+ rights but is uncomfortable with their girlfriend attending Pride events since she's in a heterosexual relationship now. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which the author disputes, and the situation has led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is that since the girlfriend is in a straight relationship, attending Pride feels like she's erasing their relationship and clinging to her past identity. The girlfriend argues that her bisexuality is still valid, and she needs to participate in Pride for community and support, as she's faced exclusion from both straight and LGBTQ+ communities in the past.\n\nLegally and socially, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. The author is essentially invalidating the girlfriend's identity by saying she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship.\" That's problematic because bisexuality doesn't require being in a relationship with a specific gender. The author's comparison to a lesbian going to straight bars doesn't hold because the girlfriend is still part of the LGBTQ+ community as a bisexual person.\n\nThe author's insecurity might stem from feeling that attending Pride undermines their relationship. However, supporting one's partner's identity and their connection to their community is important in a healthy relationship. The girlfriend's need to express her identity and feel accepted isn't something the author can control or invalidate.\n\nThe argument that the author is \"not the asshole\" would hinge on the idea that the girlfriend is within her rights to identify as bisexual and participate in Pride. The author's refusal to accept this could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The girlfriend's breakdown and ultimatum suggest that the author's stance is causing significant distress and may be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel wronged if they believe attending Pride is prioritized over the relationship. But in relationships, mutual respect for each other's identities is crucial. The author's position here seems to lack that respect for the girlfriend's self-identified bisexuality and her need to engage with her community.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're invalidating the girlfriend's sexual orientation and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
