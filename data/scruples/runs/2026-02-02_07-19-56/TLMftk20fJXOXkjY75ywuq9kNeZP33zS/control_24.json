I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She used to be in a same-sex relationship but is now in a heterosexual one. The author is upset that she goes to gay pride events, arguing that since she's not in a same-sex relationship now, she's erasing their relationship by participating in those events. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that her identity as a bisexual person isn't negated by being in a straight relationship and that attending pride is important for her sense of community and support for the cause.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's not homophobic, acknowledges her right to be who she is, but feels conflicted about her attending events associated with the LGBTQ+ community when she's in a straight relationship. His main issue seems to be that he doesn't want her to be seen as part of the LGBTQ+ community anymore because of their current relationship. He compares it to if a lesbian in a women's relationship went to straight bars, which would be hurtful to him. So his reasoning is based on feelings of insecurity or maybe a need for her to align with their straight identity as a couple.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's side. She's been told by both straight and LGBTQ+ communities that she doesn't fully fit in either when she's in a straight relationship. She identifies as bisexual and still feels part of the LGBTQ+ community because of her attraction to women. Attending pride events is her way of expressing her identity and supporting a cause she believes in. She's upset that the author is making her \"be straight\" for his comfort, which she sees as invalidating her sexuality.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and LGBTQ+ acceptance. Bisexuality is a valid orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. Even if someone is in a straight relationship now, their identity isn't erased. The LGBTQ+ community often includes bisexual individuals, and participating in pride events is a way to celebrate that identity. The author is asking her to hide part of her identity to accommodate his feelings, which could be seen as invalidating her.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting each other's identities. The author is struggling with the idea that his girlfriend can have a part of her identity that's separate from their relationship. It's important to note that her bisexuality isn't contingent on her current relationship status. Her decision to attend pride is about her personal identity and advocacy, not about being unfaithful or dismissing their relationship.\n\nThe author's comparison to a lesbian going to straight bars might not hold because bisexuality is different from being in a same-sex relationship. Also, the author is conflating her participation in LGBTQ+ events with her relationship status, which aren't mutually exclusive. His insecurity might be rooted in a fear of being compared to other potential partners or not being accepted as part of her community.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid in that he feels her actions might not align with their relationship's heteronormative context. However, in healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their identities without feeling judged. Forcing her to suppress her identity for his comfort could lead to resentment and harm the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance seems to stem from a lack of understanding of bisexuality and the importance of community for LGBTQ+ individuals. He's asking her to conform to a straight identity that she doesn't personally identify with, which is the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
