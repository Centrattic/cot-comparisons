I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants to go to Gay Pride, and he's upset about it. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is not homophobic, as he states. He's in a happy relationship with his girlfriend, who is bisexual. She was previously in a same-sex relationship but is now in a straight one. He's uncomfortable with her attending Pride because she's in a heterosexual relationship now and he feels like she's erasing their relationship by participating in an event for the LGBTQ+ community. He's comparing it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and he went to straight bars or events.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset. She feels that the author is invalidating her sexuality by suggesting she can't be part of the LGBTQ+ community anymore just because she's with a man. She finds Pride important as a way to express her identity and support the community, especially since she was previously ostracized by the straight community. She's also pointing out that bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum, and her attraction to women doesn't disappear just because she's with a man now.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is trying to protect his own insecurities, as the girlfriend mentions. He's making it about his feelings of being \"erased\" by her participation in Pride. But is that fair? The girlfriend's identity isn't contingent on her current relationship status. Being bisexual means she can be attracted to both genders, and that's part of her identity, regardless of her partner's gender. Pride events are for the entire LGBTQ+ community, which includes bisexual individuals. So, the author might be conflating her participation in Pride as a rejection of their relationship, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nAlso, the author's analogy about a same-sex couple going to straight events might not hold because straight events aren't typically seen as part of a marginalized community's struggle. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting a community that has faced discrimination. So, the comparison might be flawed.\n\nThe author's argument that she can't have the privileges of a straight relationship and the support of the LGBTQ+ community at the same time is problematic. It's a false dichotomy. People can be in one community and support another. Her participation in Pride doesn't negate their relationship. If anything, it's her expressing her identity and supporting others, which is a positive thing.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and stating that she can't see a future with him if he keeps invalidating her sexuality is a strong indicator that the author is overstepping. He's trying to control her identity based on his own insecurities. Healthy relationships require mutual respect for each other's identities and choices, even if they don't fully understand them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. He's not respecting his girlfriend's right to identify as bisexual and participate in events that are important to her community. His actions are based on his insecurities rather than supporting her identity. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
