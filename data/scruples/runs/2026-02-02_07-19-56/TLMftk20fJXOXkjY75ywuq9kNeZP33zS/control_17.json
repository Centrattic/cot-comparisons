I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a woman who identifies as bisexual. She used to be in a 5-year relationship with a woman and has always been part of the LGBT community, even though she's now with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is not homophobic and supports people being open about their sexuality. However, they feel that attending Gay Pride erases their relationship because she's in a hetero relationship. The girlfriend argues that she still identifies as bi, supports the community, and wants to celebrate her past. She also mentions feeling like she's not accepted in either community now, which is why Pride is important for her expression.\n\nThe author's perspective is valid in that they might feel uncomfortable if their partner is engaging in activities associated with another community. But bisexuality is a valid identity, and someone's participation in LGBT events doesn't necessarily negate their current relationship. The girlfriend's participation in Pride doesn't mean she's not committed to the author. It's a way for her to honor her identity and history.\n\nThe author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars and pride events isn't quite parallel. In a same-sex relationship, attending straight events might be different because the couple's entire relationship is within the LGBT context. However, in this case, the woman is in a straight relationship but still identifies as bi. Her attending Pride should be about her personal identity, not her current relationship status.\n\nThe author might be projecting insecurities onto the situation. The girlfriend is clear that she's not attracted to other women in this relationship, but the author is struggling with the idea that her participation in Prides could imply she's still part of the gay community. This could stem from a fear of being compared to ex-partners or feeling like the relationship isn't legitimate. But it's the author's insecurities that are causing the issue, not the girlfriend's actions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014storming out and having a breakdown\u2014suggests that the author's comments were hurtful. Saying she's erasing their relationship and making her \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities are problematic. Those statements don't respect her identity and may invalidate her feelings. The author might not realize that supporting her participation in Pride is part of respecting her past and current identity.\n\nBisexuality is often misunderstood, and the author's insistence that she must be in a gay relationship to be considered gay is incorrect. Bisexual individuals can be in straight or same-sex relationships and still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author's reasoning here is flawed because it doesn't recognize the validity of bisexuality in its own right.\n\nThe core issue here is the author's struggle with their own insecurities versus the girlfriend's right to express her identity. The author's actions, while stemming from a place of love, are invalidating her identity and causing conflict. The girlfriend's position is about maintaining her authentic self, which is important for her well-being and the health of the relationship.\n\nSo, in the context of the situation, the author is making the argument that their girlfriend should not participate in events tied to her identity because they're uncomfortable. The girlfriend's need to participate is about self-expression and community support, not disloyalty. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
