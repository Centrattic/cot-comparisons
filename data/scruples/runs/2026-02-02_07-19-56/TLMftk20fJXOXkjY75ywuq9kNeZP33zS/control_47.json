I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's upset that his girlfriend wants to go to Gay Pride. They've been together for three years, and she's in a heterosexual relationship now, but she was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. He's arguing that since she's in a straight relationship, attending Gay Pride erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay. She's upset, felt erased, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is not homophobic, which he mentions. The girlfriend is bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. Being in a straight relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality. The user is conflicted about her participation in Gay Pride events because he feels it's conflicting with their relationship's reality.\n\nNow, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. The fact that she's in a straight relationship doesn't mean she's not part of the LGBT community. Many bisexual people participate in Pride events. The author's argument that she's only straight if she's in a same-sex relationship is incorrect. Sexual orientation isn't determined by current relationship status. So, her being in a straight relationship doesn't make her straight.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to stem from insecurity or a fear of being \"erased\" by her participating in an event that celebrates a part of her identity. It's important to recognize that participating in Pride doesn't diminish the validity of her current relationship. The author's statement about not wanting her to be around other gay women who might assume she's gay could indicate jealousy or insecurity, which isn't a valid reason to prevent her from attending events she feels connected to.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response about being outcasted by both communities is significant. She's navigating a part of her identity that the author doesn't fully understand. The author's insistence that she should be \"straight\" to fit his comfort zone might be dismissive of her true identity. The fact that she left the house shows how hurtful his words were.\n\nIn terms of the question, the key is whether the author is wrong. The answer hinges on whether his argument is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the importance of Pride events. Since he's making her hide a part of her identity for his insecurities, that's problematic. The author is in the wrong because he's not supporting her authentic self-expression. So, the answer is A.\n"
