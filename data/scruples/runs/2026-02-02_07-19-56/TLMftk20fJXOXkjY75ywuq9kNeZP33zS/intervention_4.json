I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author isn't homophobic, but he's upset because his girlfriend is in a hetero relationship and he feels she's erasing their relationship by going to Pride. His main point is that since she's not in a same-sex relationship now, she shouldn't identify as part of the LGBT community anymore. But his girlfriend has a history in the community and still identifies as bi. She argues that her sexuality isn't defined by her current relationship status and that Pride is important for her identity and the community's history.\n\nHe mentions that she had a breakdown, which is out of character, and she's leaving him. He's confused because he supports gay pride but feels hurt. The key points here are about identity, the right to self-identify, and the role of community events like Pride. \n\nBi people are part of the LGBT community, regardless of their current relationship status. The author's argument that she's not gay until she's in a gay relationship might be based on a misunderstanding about what it means to be bi. Bisexual individuals can be in hetero relationships but still identify as part of the LGBT community. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the entire LGBT community, not just those in same-sex relationships. \n\nThe author's feelings of insecurity might stem from feeling that her participation in Pride somehow undermines their relationship. However, the girlfriend's participation in Pride could be about her identity and support for a community she's part of. The author's demand that she \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities is a form of erasure, which is harmful.\n\nIn terms of respect in a relationship, both partners should support each other's identities unless there's a valid reason to be concerned (which isn't the case here). The author's actions might be seen as controlling or dismissive of her identity. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling invalidated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his stance is based on invalidating his girlfriend's identity and not respecting her right to support the community she identifies with. The answer should be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
