I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that his girlfriend goes to Gay Pride events despite being in a heterosexual relationship now. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, was previously in a same-sex relationship, and now is with the author. She wants to attend Pride events, which he objects to because she's in a straight relationship and he feels she's erasing their relationship by participating in the LGBT community. She's upset, had a breakdown, and left. The author is conflicted but thinks he's not homophobic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting her to go to Pride. Let's break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend is bi, which means she's attracted to multiple genders. Bisexual people are part of the LGBT community, so her identity isn't erased just because she's in a heterosexual relationship now. Pride events are for celebrating and supporting the entire LGBT community, not just those in same-sex relationships. The author's argument that she's not part of the community because she's in a straight relationship now might be incorrect. Being bi doesn't stop just because someone is in a straight relationship.\n\nThe author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions. He's worried that her attending Pride is like his hypothetical partner going to straight bars if he were gay. But the key here is that the girlfriend is still part of the community, and attending Pride is a way to support and celebrate that identity. The author is making her choose between her community and their relationship, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, the author says he's not homophobic but is acting as if her participation in Pride is a problem. The girlfriend's need to express her identity and connect with her community is valid. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her identity, which is a harmful dynamic in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of insecurity might be genuine. However, the way he's handling it\u2014telling her she can't go to Pride because of his discomfort\u2014could be seen as controlling. He should address his insecurities by communicating better, perhaps seeking counseling, rather than trying to restrict her participation in her community.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's dismissing her identity and not supporting her participation in the community she's part of. He's also not handling his insecurities constructively, which is causing conflict. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
