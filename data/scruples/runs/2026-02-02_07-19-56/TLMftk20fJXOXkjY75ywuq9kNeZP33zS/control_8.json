I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with their girlfriend, who identifies as bisexual. She used to be in a 5-year relationship with a woman and has been going to Gay Pride events every year. The author doesn't want her to go this year because they feel it's erasing their relationship and making it seem like she's still gay. The girlfriend got upset, saying she needs to express her pride in the LGBT community and that she's still part of it because she's bi. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for feeling this way.\n\nFirst, I should consider the definitions and the girlfriend's identity. Bisexuality means being attracted to both men and women, so even though she's in a heterosexual relationship now, her identity isn't necessarily erased. The author is conflating her current relationship status with her sexual identity. Just because she's dating a guy now doesn't mean she can't still identify as bi. So by saying she isn't part of the community anymore, the author might be invalidating her identity.\n\nThen there's the aspect of Pride events. These are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, regardless of current relationship status. Many bisexual people attend Pride events to show solidarity and celebrate their identity. The author's argument that she's in a hetero relationship and thus shouldn't be part of the community is similar to the idea of \"bi-erasure,\" where bisexual individuals are told they don't belong to the LGBT community because they're in a relationship with someone of the opposite gender. That's a common issue, and it's harmful because it denies their identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that the author's words deeply hurt her. She mentioned feeling outcast by both straight and LGBT communities when she was in a previous relationship, which points to her need for acceptance and belonging. The author's insistence that she should \"be straight\" to protect their insecurities seems to be projecting their own discomfort onto her, rather than respecting her identity and her right to participate in events that affirm her.\n\nThe author also uses an analogy about a female-female relationship going to straight bars, but that's a different context. Straight bars aren't typically spaces for specific identity groups, whereas Pride events are inclusive of the LGBT community. So the comparison might not hold because the motivations and environments are different.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The author brought up their feelings but in a way that caused conflict. Maybe if they had approached it with more openness and understanding, they could have found a middle ground. However, the core issue is the author's belief that their girlfriend's participation in Pride events is inappropriate, which is likely based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the purpose of Pride.\n\nIn terms of the relationship dynamics, the girlfriend feels her identity is being erased, and the author is struggling with their insecurities. It's important to validate her feelings and identity. The author might not be intentionally malicious, but their stance does invalidate her experiences and identity, which is a problem. Respecting her autonomy and her right to participate in events that are meaningful to her is key here. So, the author is probably in the wrong because they are not supporting their girlfriend's identity, which is a fundamental part of who she is. The correct answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
