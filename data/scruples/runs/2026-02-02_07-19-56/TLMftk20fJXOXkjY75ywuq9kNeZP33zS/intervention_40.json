I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride when she's in a heterosexual relationship. The author says they're not homophobic and support the LGBT community, but they're upset because their girlfriend, who was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bi, still wants to go to Pride events. The author feels that her attending these events erases their relationship and makes it seem like she's still gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's bi and feels connected to the LGBT community because of her past and her ongoing identity. She's also mentioned that she was outcasted by both straight and LGBT communities in the past. For her, Pride might be a way to feel accepted and support a cause she cares about. The author is worried about her being around other gay women and possibly feeling more connected to that community, which makes him feel insecure.\n\nThe author argues that since she's in a heterosexual relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore. But bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of current relationship status. The key point here is that bisexuality is part of the LGBT spectrum, so her attending Pride is a way to celebrate her identity. The author's comparison to a lesbian going to straight bars might not hold because Pride is about community and solidarity, not just about current relationships.\n\nThe author's feelings of insecurity are valid, but they shouldn't override her right to express her identity. The girlfriend's breakdown and storming out suggest that the author's comments hurt her, possibly making her feel invalidated. The author might be projecting their own insecurities onto her, not understanding the importance of her participation in Pride. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's stance seems to invalidate the girlfriend's identity. Bisexual people can be part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner's gender. The author's insistence that she must \"be straight\" now because she's in a heterosexual relationship is incorrect. Additionally, the argument about not getting the \"privileges\" of both communities is a false dichotomy\u2014people can belong to multiple communities. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her identity and for making her feel like she has to choose between her current relationship and her past and ongoing bisexuality. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
