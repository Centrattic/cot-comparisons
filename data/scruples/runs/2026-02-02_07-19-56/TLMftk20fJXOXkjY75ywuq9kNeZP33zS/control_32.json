I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The author is questioning whether it's wrong that he doesn't want his girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. They've been together three years, and she's bisexual, previously in a same-sex relationship. He's not homophobic but feels she's erasing their relationship by attending Pride, since she's now in a heterosexual relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend identifies as bi, which is a valid sexual orientation. Being bi means being attracted to more than one gender, so even in a current opposite-sex relationship, her bisexuality is still a part of her identity. The author's issue is that he feels she's acting as if she's still gay when she's in a straight relationship. But bisexuality doesn't require being in a relationship with a specific gender at any given time. So, her attending Pride as part of her ongoing identity might be reasonable.\n\nHe also mentions feeling that she's not part of the LGBT community now because she's in a straight relationship. But bisexuality is part of the LGBT spectrum. Even if she's dating a man now, her sexuality doesn't change. The community events like Pride are for anyone who identifies as part of the LGBT+ community, regardless of their current relationship status. So, her participation is valid.\n\nHe compares it to a same-sex couple attending straight bars, implying she shouldn't go to Pride if he wouldn't do that in reverse. But the analogy might not hold because the contexts are different. If he were in a same-sex relationship, attending straight pride events might be a different scenario, but Pride is specifically about supporting LGBT+ rights and celebrating identity, which is more central to a bisexual person's experience.\n\nHe also brings up insecurities and feeling that she's not committed to their relationship, but he says she's never looked elsewhere. His argument that her bisexuality isn't \"real\" unless she's in a same-sex relationship is problematic. Sexual orientation isn't validated by current relationship status. Her identity is her own, and attending Pride is about her self-expression and support for the community, not about her relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests deep emotional impact. Feeling erased or pressured to conform to his expectations could be a point against the author. She's explaining her need to participate in Pride as a way to connect with her community and history, which is important for her identity. The author's insistence that she shouldn't go because he feels hurt or insecure might be dismissing her needs and identity.\n\nIn terms of support for the community, the author says he supports Gay Pride but finds her attendance hurtful. There's a difference between supporting the cause and feeling that participants must be in same-sex relationships. The community is inclusive of all identities, including bisexual people, regardless of their current dating status.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's stance seems to invalidate his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to engage with the community. His argument that she can't have both straight privileges and LGBT community support is flawed because bisexuality inherently exists within the LGBT community. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong by not respecting her identity and needs.\n"
