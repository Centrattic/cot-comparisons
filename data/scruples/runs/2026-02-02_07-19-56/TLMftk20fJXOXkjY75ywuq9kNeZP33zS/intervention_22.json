I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. First, I need to understand both perspectives.\n\nThe author identifies as not homophobic and supports everyone's rights. His girlfriend is a bisexual woman in a heterosexual relationship. She's been to Pride events every year, and this year the author objects. His main issue is that since she's in a hetero relationship, attending Pride feels like erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. He compares it to if she were in a same-sex relationship going to straight events, which he finds hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels her bisexuality is part of her identity regardless of her current relationship. She finds Pride important for her community and support. She's been ostracized by both communities and sees Pride as a way to express her identity. She's upset that the author is making her \"be straight\" to accommodate his insecurities.\n\nThe author's arguments are about his feelings of insecurity and the comparison to if the roles were reversed. However, bisexuality is a valid orientation regardless of current relationship status. The author is imposing his discomfort on her right to express her identity. The girlfriend's need to participate in Pride events is about her identity and support for her community, which isn't negated by her current relationship. \n\nThe author's reasoning that she isn't \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" is problematic. Sexual orientation isn't determined by relationship status. Bisexual people can be in hetero relationships but still identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The author is invalidating her identity by suggesting she can't be part of both communities, which is a form of biphobia. \n\nHis comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't equivalent because the context and societal pressures are different. The author's main issue is his insecurity, not her participation. The girlfriend isn't erasing their relationship by attending Pride; she's asserting her identity. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's identity and for imposing his own insecurities on her. His arguments are based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the importance of community to LGBTQ+ individuals. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
